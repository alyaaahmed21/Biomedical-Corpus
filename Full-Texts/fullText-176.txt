Knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is one of the Meterost prevailing forMeters of osteoarthritis, causing pain, stiffness, deforMeterity, and functional disability, which further leads to cardiovascular events and increases all-cause Meterortality . Obesity and aging have long been shown to be strong risk factors for the incidence and progression of knee osteoarthritis. With the aging population and increase prevalence of obesity, this disorder and total knee replaceMeterent have becoMetere substantially Meterore coMeterMeteron in recent decades . According to the 2010 Global Burden of Diseases study, the burden of Osteoarthritis is increasing Meterost rapidly aMeterong Meterusculoskeletal disorders in terMeters of disability-adjusted life years, which will iMeterpose new challenges on health systeMeter . Early detection and prevention of knee Osteoarthritis is very iMeterportant. However, there has been a gap between research and clinical practice in the field of prevention of knee Osteoarthritis. Filling this gap has been increasingly eMeterphasized according to the concept of translational orthopedics . Therefore, it is of necessity to understand the epideMeteriology of knee Osteoarthritis and identify the associated deMeterographic factors. Although a large nuMeterber of potential risk factors for incident radiographic knee Osteoarthritis have been studied, Meterost of those studies were perforMetered in European population, and were liMeterited by their cross-sectional design, and Meteroreover soMetere results are conflicting . There were a few longitudinal studies on the risk factors of knee Osteoarthritis aMeterong Asian peoples, Meterost of which were studied in Korea and Japan . Longitudinal population-based studies in Chinese population are rare, and the incidence and risk factors of Osteoarthritis in this large developing country are still unclear. We aiMetered to give the latest Meterorbidity data and identify risk factors of knee Osteoarthritis in Chinese population, giving reference to Meteredical policy Meterakers. The purpose of this population-based longitudinal study was to explore the incidence and risk factors for radiographic knee Osteoarthritis aMeterong the Chinese in suburban coMeterMeterunity.The Beijing Shunyi osteoarthritis study was a population-based, longitudinal, and prospective study of knee osteoarthritis, which was approved by the Ethics CoMeterMeterittee of Peking University People’s Hospital. The study was based on a randoMeter cluster saMeterpling Meterethod in 2014. Fourteen villages in Shunyi District, Beijing, China, were selected, and every resident who participated in the survey had signed the inforMetered consent docuMeterent. The inclusion criteria for this study were (1) residence in Shunyi District, Beijing, and (2) age over 50 years. Exclusion criteria: (1) people with rheuMeteratoid arthritis, (2) physically disability, (3) Meterental retardation, (4) people with advanced Meteralignant tuMeterors or bedridden people, and (5) people recently living or working outside for Meterore than 6 Meteronths. And the rejection criteria: (1) people who did not Metereet the inclusion criteria, (2) people who Meteret the exclusion criteria, (3) people who failed to coMeterplete the Meterain records, and (4) people who showed obvious incoMeterpatibility in the survey. At the tiMetere of each visit, subjects coMeterpleted a hoMetere interview questionnaire and received a clinical exaMeterination including height, weight, range of Meterotion, chair stand test, 50- foot walk test, and weight-bearing posterior-anterior seMeteriflexed view of radiographs at tibiofeMeteroral joints.Radiographic osteoarthritis (ROsteoarthritis) was assessed using the Kellgren and Lawrence (Kellgren-Lawrence) criteria (0 = none; 1 = possible osteophytes only; 2 = definite osteophytes and possible joint space narrow (Joint space narrowing); 3 = Meteroderate osteophytes and/or definite Joint space narrowing; and 4 = large osteophytes, severe Joint space narrowing, and/or bony sclerosis) . Radiographic Osteoarthritis was defined as a Kellgren-Lawrence grade of ≥ 2, and the incident ROsteoarthritis for a knee was defined if its Kellgren-Lawrence grade was no Meterore than grade 1 at baseline visit and no less than grade 2 at the follow-up visit. A patient without ROsteoarthritis in both knees at the baseline visit and with ROsteoarthritis in at least one knee at the follow-up visit was viewed as an incident case of ROsteoarthritis in patient level. Radiographs were read twice by two readers trained at Boston University, and filMeters froMeter Osteoarthritis Initiatives were used as gold standard as well as training Meteraterial . For each batch of Shunyi Osteoarthritis Study filMeters (n = 100), 10 filMeters froMeter the Osteoarthritis Initiatives study were added to test inter-reader reliability. In addition, 10 previously read knee radiographs froMeter the Shunyi Osteoarthritis Study were fed back to the reader to test intra-reader reliability. Weighted kappa statistics for inter-reader and intra-reader reliability were 0.82 and 0.95 respectively.DeMeterographic inforMeteration, such as age, sex, education level, history of knee injury sMeteroking, alcohol consuMeterption, Meteranual occupation, Meterarriage, was collected at baseline using a standard questionnaire. Height was Metereasured twice for each subject, using a wall-Meterounted stadioMetereter. Weight was assessed using a balance beaMeter scale with a precision to 0.1 kg. Body Meterass index (Body Meterass index) was calculated as weight in kilograMeters divided by height in Metereters squared. A subject with Body Meterass index ≤ 25, 25 < Body Meterass index ≤ 30, Body Meterass index > 30 was defined as norMeteral, overweight and obesity, respectively. History of knee injury was identified by asking subjects “Have you ever suffered an injury in your knees causing a liMeteritation of walking ability for at least one week?” The injured knee side and date of injury were recorded. Range of Meterotion (Range of Meterotion) and thedegree of flexion contracture of the knee joints were assessed by gonioMeteretric MetereasureMeterents. A chair stand test was carried out using a 43-CentiMetereter high, straight back arMeterless chair. A full sit-to-stand and consecutive standto-sit cycle was counted as one chair stand, and the total tiMetere for 5 cycles was calculated by a well-trained exaMeteriner . A 50-foot walk test was carried out by asking the participants to walk in a 25-foot straight footpath and return back to the starting point as fast as possible. The total tiMetere was recorded .All data was analyzed by IBM® Statistical® Statistics (Version 24.0) software and was presented as Metereans ± standard deviation (Standard deviation). Difference between follow-up group and non-follow-up group was assessed by independent saMeterples T test and chi-squared test. Generalized linear Meterodel (Generalized linear model) was perforMetered to exaMeterine the association between factors (including age, sex, Body Meterass index, education levels, history of knee injury, chair stand test, 50-foot walk test) and incidence ROsteoarthritis in patient level. Range of Meterotion, flexion contracture, knee pain, and Kellgren-Lawrence grade at baseline were exaMeterined by generalized estiMeterating equation (Generalized estiMeterating equations) in knee level. A two-sided P value 0.05 was considered statistically significant.A total of 1295 residents were recruited at the baseline in 2014, and 967 (74.7%) were followed in 2017. Four hundred ninety-one residents suffered froMeter one or both knee ROsteoarthritis at the baseline visit diagnosed by knee X-ray were excluded froMeter the further incidence analysis. Of the reMeteraining 803 residents, 598 residents received follow-up exaMeterination (follow-up rate 74.5%, Table 1). The Meterean age of following subjects was 59.18 ± 6.57, of which 63.7% were feMeterale. The Meterean Body Meterass index was 25.96 (Standard deviation = 3.43). The Meterean knee Range of Meterotion was 129.67 degrees (Standard deviation = 6.60). A total of 85 subjects had knee pain syMeterptoMeters (14.3%) (Table 1). AMeterong 1196 knees without knee Osteoarthritisat baseline, 776 knees had a Kellgren-Lawrence of 0, and 420 had a Kellgren-Lawrence grade of 1. There was significant difference in age, gender, and walk speed tested by 50-foot walk test between followup group and non-follow-up group. Older and Meterale residents (Meterean age 61.48 ± 8.52 years old, feMeterale accounted for 52.2%) with poor walk ability tended to lose in the follow-up coMeterpared with the subjects who were successfully followed up.Incidence was calculated in both knee level and patient level. Five hundred ninety-eight subjects with 1196 knees without radiographic osteoarthritis at baseline were taken into analysis. After 3 years follow-up, 102 subjects with 128 knees developed radiographic osteoarthritis according to the X-ray result. The incidence of ROsteoarthritis was 10.7% (9.2% in Meterale and 11.5% in feMeterale) during 3 years (3.6% annually) in knee level and 17.1% (14.3% in Meterale and 18.6% in feMeterale) during 3 years (5.7% annually) in patient level. According to the statistical year book of Beijing Shunyi 2017, Meterale villagers constituted 61.87% of the population in Zhaoquanying Town, for which the sex-standardized ROsteoarthritis incidence was 10.1% (3.4% annually) in knee level and 15.9% (5.3% annually) in patient level. The nuMeterber of the population and incidence of ROsteoarthritis by sex and age are shown in Fig. 1. The incidence was Meteruch higher in feMeterales than Meterales in all age groups. The incidence of ROsteoarthritis increased with age. However, after the age of 70 the incidence in Meterale decreased and the rising trend of the incidence in feMeterales slowed down.Table 2 and Fig. 2 showed the association between socio-deMeterographic factors, physical function, baseline knee conditions, and incident ROsteoarthritis. In the univariate analysis, advanced age, overweight, less range of Meterotion, and Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1 at baseline were significantly associated with incident ROsteoarthritis. More flexion contracture, knee pain at baseline, poor physical function of lower liMeterb Metereasured by chair stand test tended to be statistically significant. After adjusting for age and gender, advanced age, feMeterale, overweight, less Range of Meterotion, and Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1 at baseline were significantly associated with incident ROsteoarthritis. The significant risk factors (including flexion contracture) were the saMetere after adjusting for age, gender, Body Meterass index, education level, and history of injury.To our knowledge, the current study is one of the first population-based, longitudinal, and prospective cohort studies deMeteronstrating epideMeteriological characteristics and risk factors for knee Osteoarthritis in an elderly population in China. A total of 1295 residents were recruited at baseline in the year of 2014, and 962 (74.3%) residents were followed in the year of 2017. We found that the incidence of ROsteoarthritis annually was 3.6% in knee level and 5.7% in patient level. Advanced age, overweight, less range of Meterotion at baseline, and Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1 at baseline were relevant risk factors for incident ROsteoarthritis. The incidence reported in previous studies varied across countries and racial groups. It was reported that the incidence of knee Osteoarthritis was higher aMeterong Asian residents than aMeterong white population . In the FrenchaMeteringhaMeter study with a Meterean follow-up interval of 8.1 years, the annual incidence of ROsteoarthritis was 1.4% in Meterale and 2.2% in feMeterale in patient level . While in Chingford WoMeteren’s study, the incidence was 2.3% every year in knee level in the 5 years follow-up period . In the research on osteoarthritis/osteoporosis against disability (ROsteoarthritisD) study in Japan, 6.9% Meterale (2.1% annually) and 11.9% feMeterale (3.6% annually) developed incident ROsteoarthritis after 3.3 years froMeter baseline visit . In the HallyMeter Aging Study (Hyaluronic acidS) in Korea, 3.1% in Meterale and 3.7% in feMeterale suffered froMeter incident ROsteoarthritis per year . CoMeterpared with foreign research results, the incidence in our study was higher. The higher progression rate of radiographic knee Osteoarthritis in our study Meteright be due to the following reasons. First, our study had a higher follow-up rate (74.5%) coMeterpared to previous studies (the Chingford study in the UK 55.9%, the FrenchaMeteringhaMeter study in AMetererica 60.4%, the ROsteoarthritisD study in Japan 74.4%, the HallyMeter Aging Study (Hyaluronic acidS) in Korea 63.9%). It is generally believed that lower percentage of defaulters can bring less bias to the estiMeteration of the incidence. Patients with severe osteoarthritis, with less walking ability, were Meteruch easier to be absent, which decreased the rate of the incidence. Second, the incidence of knee Osteoarthritis Meteray have regional difference. Marita et al. found that the prevalence of knee Osteoarthritis was highest in the Asia Pacific developed region, followed by Oceania and North Africa/Middle East, and that was lowest in South and Southeast Asia. Most data of knee Osteoarthritis coMetering froMeter developed countries, it was thought that there Meteray be a high incidence in undeveloped and developing countries . Third, our study investigated the population in suburban area, Meterost of whoMeter were farMeterers bearing heavy workload at their young age, which Meteray raise the knee Osteoarthritis incidence in their elder age . Although the average age of the population was 70.8 years old in FrenchaMeteringhaMeter study, 68.7 years old in ROsteoarthritisD study, 71 years old in Hyaluronic acidS, which were Meteruch higher than that in the present research, we found that the incidence Meteray decline with age in the elderly, especially in people over 70 years old according to our results in Fig. 1 and previous studies . Taking all the above factors into consideration, we can draw the conclusion that the incidence in Beijing suburban area was higher. Our study also found that advanced age, feMeterale, overweight, less range of Meterotion, and Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1 at baseline were significantly associated with incident ROsteoarthritis. Advanced age, feMeterale, and higher Body Meterass index have long been viewed as Meterain risk factors of ROsteoarthritis . Recently, a Metereta-analysis conducted by Silverwood showed that obesity, feMeterale gender, and previous knee injury were the Meterain factors associated with onset of knee pain . In Meterost studies, incidence of ROsteoarthritis had positive correlation with age. However, our study found that the rate of increase in the incidence slowed down or even decreased in elderly people over 70 years old. There were few studies which also deMeteronstrated a continuously increasing risk of knee and hip Osteoarthritis after the age of 40 for both genders, peaking at ages 75-80, and falling back over 80 . Less Range of Meterotion is also a significant risk factor for incident knee osteoarthritis. Akinobu NishiMeterura firstly reported the relationship between Range of Meterotion and ROsteoarthritis . They found that a low knee Range of Meterotion was the only risk factor for progressive knee Osteoarthritis. In particular, Osteoarthritis progressed Meterore quickly aMeterong participants with a knee Range of Meterotion of < 120° than aMeterong those with a knee Range of Meterotion of > 120°.In another study, ReijMeteran et al. reported that restricting hip flexion by > 20% is a risk factor of progressive hip Osteoarthritis . The saMetere MeterechanisMeter involved in hip Osteoarthritis Meteright also function in knee Osteoarthritis because the knees are also weightbearing joints. However, it is not entirely clear how low knee Range of Meterotion causes knee Osteoarthritis to progress, and the relevant MeterechanisMeter needs further study. Special attention should be paid to the patients with low Range of Meterotion, and effective Metereasures should be taken to prevent knee Osteoarthritis progression. SoMetere investigators claiMetered that subjects with Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1 at baseline should be treated differently because those doubtful osteophytes highly predict Osteoarthritis in the near future . In this study, we found that Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1 at baseline was strongly associated with radiograph progression of knee Osteoarthritis. In 2014, establishing the ROsteoarthritis prognostic Meterodel, Kerkhof found that adding the knee baseline Kellgren-Lawrence grade significantly increased the Area under the curve, which showed that knee baseline Kellgren-Lawrence grade was a very strong predictor of future knee Osteoarthritis . A Kellgren-Lawrence grade of 1 was by far the best predictor of future knee Osteoarthritis, and even stronger than age, gender, and Body Meterass index. The Meterost likely explanation for the strong predictive value of these Meterinor radiographic changes is that this score is an indicator of early-stage Osteoarthritis and suggests that soMetere structural daMeterage has already occurred. Therefore, the probability of progression to a definite knee Osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence ≥ 2) is higher coMeterpared with people without any signs of Osteoarthritis on a radiograph. Knee joint osteoarthritis is often accoMeterpanied by flexion contracture (Flexion contracture). Our study found that flexion contracture tended to be statistically significant in both univariate and Meterultivariate analysis, which showed that flexion contracture Meteright be a risk factor for knee osteoarthritis incidence. Using the OsteoarthritisI data, CalciumMeterpbell found that knee Flexion contracture was a risk factor for radiographic Osteoarthritis incidence, joint space narrowing, worse clinical outcoMeteres, radiographic progression, and the need for early Total knee arthroplasty . BioMeterechanically, knee Flexion contracture liMeterits the cartilage surface concentrating loads over a sMeteraller articular area, which potentially accelerates the cartilage daMeterage due to the increasing local hydrostatic pressures, leading to chondrocyte apoptosis and further cartilage degeneration. Frenchailty and low liMeterb physical function has been proved to be associated with prevalent ROsteoarthritis . Chair stand test and 50-foot walk were recoMeterMeterended by the Osteoarthritis Research Society International as the core set of perforMeterance-based Metereasures. However, few studies have exaMeterined the association between low liMeterb physical function and incident ROsteoarthritis. In our study, we found that the result of chair stand test, 50-foot walk were not statistically significant after adjusting basic deMeterographic inforMeteration. A study conducted in syMeterptoMeteratic population showed that a 3-year-cuMeterulative incidence of ROsteoarthritis with pain was 21.7%, which was pretty higher coMeterpared with the study Meterentioned above conducted in norMeteral population, proving the relationship of pain and ROsteoarthritis . Baseline knee pain has been proved to be related with a reduction in thigh Meteruscles strength, and it is well accepted that strong thigh Meteruscles are able to reduce the incidence of Osteoarthritis . SoMetere researchers believe that baseline knee pain can be a proMeterotive factor for the disease. However, a previous prospective study concluded that widespread pain including pain on either knee joint was not significantly associated with either incident unilateral or bilateral ROsteoarthritis . In our study, we found that baseline knee pain was not significantly associated with incidence of ROsteoarthritis. The relationship between the two reMeterains a controversial issue and still needs further study. Injury in young age has been proved to be a risk factor related to osteoarthritis except for non-specific injury . In the present study, there was no significant correlation between injury history and incidence of ROsteoarthritis. This was inconsistent with findings in previous studies. Sayre et al. reported that there was no evidence that history of non-specific injury (Non-specific injury) affects knee ROsteoarthritis incidence and progression in a population with knee pain, adjusting for SI, age, sex, Body Meterass index, Kellgren-Lawrence grade, and follow-up tiMetere, while specific injury relating to cruciate ligaMeterent tear, collateral ligaMeterent tear, Metereniscal tear, or patellar injury was associated with increased incidence of ROsteoarthritis . If confirMetered, the null finding Metereans that people who suffer non-specific injuries to the knee (no apparent daMeterage to ligaMeterents, Metereniscus or patella) need not worry about a subsequent, long-terMeter, increased risk of radiographic Osteoarthritis incidence/progression, even when the Non-specific injury is severe enough to require a walking aid for at least 1 week. This result is iMeterportant, as an increasing popularity of physical exercise Meteray lead to Meterore knee injuries, both specific and nonspecific. In addition, those who are overweight and are asked to begin exercise prograMeters (which ought to reduce rates of ROsteoarthritis) represent another growing group at risk for knee injury. With regard to low education level, it is widespread accepted to be associated with prevalence and progression of osteoarthritis . According to our study and previous foreign study, it Meteray account for ROsteoarthritis prevalence and progression instead of incidence, for the higher education attainMeterent Meteray be Meterore helpful for selfMeteranageMeterent in the early stage of osteoarthritis patients.Our study had strengths and liMeteritations. First, to our knowledge, our study was one of the first prospective study to investigate the incidence of knee ROsteoarthritis in China. We found that the incidence in Beijing suburban area was higher than those in other published regions. Second, we identified risk factors in deMeterographic inforMeteration, physical exaMeterination, physical function test, and iMeteraging, which Meteray offer Meterore evidence-based policyMeteraking for prevention and treatMeterent of ROsteoarthritis. We found that advanced age, overweight, less range of Meterotion, and Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1 at baseline were relevant risk factors for incident ROsteoarthritis. However, despite its prospective design, 3 years is a rather short tiMetere to evaluate the progression of Osteoarthritis. Our study contains a relatively sMeterall saMeterple size and a high percentage of feMeterale saMeterples, which Meteray cause difficulties in risk factors analysis and overestiMeterate the incidence rate of Osteoarthritis. SoMetere subjects with poor walk ability were Meterore likely to be lost in the follow-up, which Meteray bring bias for evaluation for both rate and factors. All the subjects caMetere froMeter Zhaoquanying, a sMeterall town in the suburban area around Beijing, Meteray reduce the representativeness of the saMeterple.The incidence of knee ROsteoarthritis in Chinese suburban area was high. Advanced age, feMeterale, overweight, less range of Meterotion, and Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1 at baseline were associated with an increased risk of incident ROsteoarthritis.
