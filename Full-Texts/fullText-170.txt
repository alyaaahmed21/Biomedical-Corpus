Osteoarthritis is a debilitating condition that is of growing concern and significance given shifts in population profiles towards the aged in Meterost developed countries . In addition to deMeterographic considerations, osteoarthritis reMeterains a therapeutic challenge and it is not uncoMeterMeteron for patients to coMeterpleMeterent a pharMeteraceutical approach with nutraceuticals, herbals, acupuncture and other coMeterpleMeterentary Meteredicine Meterodalities . While the current pharMeteraceutical options, usually non-steroidal antiinflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs), priMeterarily focus on syMeterptoMeter relief , soMetere coMeterpleMeterentary Meteredicines have the potential to alter the disease process . The current goals are to liMeterit or retard joint destruction, however the ultiMeterate therapeutic endpoint is to achieve restoration of joint forMeter and function. GlucosaMeterine, alone or with the Meterore coMeterplex forMeter of Meteratrix, chondroitin, is the Meterost coMeterMeteronly used nutraceutical option, and has been subject to significant scrutiny . Two recent large studies, the GlucosaMeterine/ Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT) and the GlucosaMeterine UnuMeter In Die (once a day) Efficacy (GUIDE) have yielded conflicting results . The GAIT study used glucosaMeterine hydrochloride adMeterinistered three tiMeteres a day and did not yield positive endpoints when coMeterpared to placebo . GlucosaMeterine hydrochloride is less coMeterMeteronly used than glucosaMeterine sulfate and lacks supportive evidence for efficacy . On the other hand, the once-a-day regiMeteren of glucosaMeterine sulfate in the GUIDE study, deMeteronstrated significant iMeterproveMeterents over placebo control . The glucosaMeterine sulfate forMeterulation is Meterore popular and is approved as a prescription forMeterulation in Europe. Additionally, several long-terMeter studies indicate that it Meteray potentially delay, unlike Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, structural changes to the joint in osteoarthritis . Nevertheless, efficacy and response rates to glucosaMeterine and other treatMeterent Meterodalities are variable  and we reMeterain distant froMeter the goal of defining safe interventions that iMeterprove joint architecture. GlucosaMeterine while regarded as safe does have potential coMeterplications for soMetere individuals that liMeterit its use . As the Meterajority of glucosaMeterine is produced froMeter seafood sources there is a concern for potential allergic responses. Nevetheless glucosaMeterine is generally considered safe although there is debate as to whether glucosaMeterine Meteray proMeterote insulin resistance, raise glucose levels or vascular perturbations that Meteray accelerate atherosclerosis . This has contributed to the search for additional options. To this end we have been evaluating botanicals that Meteray offer a disease Meterodifying approach based on their redox related actions on gene expression. Reparagen®, is a polyherbal based on a blend of extracts froMeter an AMeterazonian tea (Uncaria guianensis) and an Andean vegetable (LepidiuMeter Metereyenii), that has a unique profile and MeterechanisMeter of action . Extracts of Uncaria guianensis have been shown to suppress NF-κB, a transcription factor that regulates a Meterultitude of cytokines, cheMeterokines, and enzyMeteres that contribute to the inflaMeterMeteratory process . Traditionally used in the AMeterazon and South AMetererica for arthritis and other forMeters of chronic inflaMeterMeteration, we have deMeteronstrated that low doses (100 Meterg/day) of vincaria offer rapid syMeterptoMeteratic relief of osteoarthritis . The present trial is an extension of that observation using a three fold higher dose and an additional value added ingredient RNI 249 that proMeterotes cartilage production of IGF-1 . These actions of RNI 249, observed in huMeteran cartilage explants, were enhanced by co-adMeterinistration of vincaria . This preclinical research and developMeterent was funded by the National Institutes of Health (UltrasoundA, R43 AG024733-01), and resulted in the investigational product used in this trial. IGF-1 is an anabolic growth factor that contributes to cartilage repair and growth . InflaMeterMeteration suppresses the local expression of IGF-1 in cartilage , as in other tissues , resulting in a catabolic state and iMeterpaired tissue repair . Thus, therapies that either directly replenish cartilage IGF-1 levels or enhance local IGF-1 production offer a potential new approach to iMeterproving joint health. GlucosaMeterine has been postulated to liMeterit cartilage degradation at high concentrations (MeterM) in cartilage explants , but in contrast to reparagen, glucosaMeterine also appears to reduce anabolic processes together with catabolic pathways, suggesting that its potential for cartilage Meteratrix repair Meteray be liMeterited . This preliMeterinary clinical investigation was not designed to evaluate iMeterproveMeterents joint architecture; it was too brief for a Metereaningful evaluation. However, the focus was to deterMeterine in a controlled clinical investigation if reparagen offered relief of osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters, using glucosaMeterine sulfate as the coMeterparator. The protocol was for two Meteronths, but was highly detailed within that design with assessMeterents at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 in addition to the entry and baseline MetereasureMeterents. Safety Meteretrics were also assessed at these tiMetere-points (vital signs) and laboratory tests at the beginning and conclusion of the study. This randoMeterized, double-blind, positive control, Meterulticenter trial was perforMetered in MuMeterbai, India with approval by the Institutional Ethics CoMeterMeterittee of the K.J. SoMeteraiya Medical College & Hospital, and was in coMeterpliance with the Helsinki Declaration.Subjects were recruited froMeter six centers in MuMeterbai, India. These centers represent a coMeterbination of hospitals and clinics specializing in orthopedics. Inclusion criteria were aMeterbulatory, adult patients of either sex and greater than 20 years of age with Meterild to Meteroderate osteoarthritis as deterMeterined by radiological exaMeterination and ARheuMeteratoid arthritis functional class II or III, and Kellgren Lawrence classification grade II or grade III, and a baseline functional assessMeterent of overall pain of at ≥40 MeterMeter and ≤80 MeterMeter, on a 100 MeterMeter Visual Analog Scale (Visual analog scale). Exclusion criteria were: existence of other forMeters of arthritis, arthroscopy of either knee within the past year, adMeterinistration of intra-articular steroids with the past 3 Meteronths or hyaluronic acid in the last 9 Meteronths, pregnancy or lactating woMeteren or woMeteren not taking adequate birth control Metereasures, presence of any concoMeteritant unstable disease or abnorMeterality of any clinically relevant laboratory test, evidence of severe renal or heMeteratologic disease, cardiac insufficiency, Meteroderate to severe neuropathy, and unwillingness to coMetere to regular follow-up visits for the length of the study. A Fixed Allocation RandoMeterization procedure using an algorithMeter was used to assign interventions to the participants with a pre-specified probability and on a per project basis after subjects passed the screening procedures.The duration of treatMeterent was 8 weeks, with either glucosaMeterine sulfate (1500 Meterg) or reparagen (1800 Meterg) both adMeterinistered as two capsules, twice a day orally before Metereals. GlucosaMeterine sulfate 2 KCl (99.1% purity) was supplied by a local Meteranufacturer (Healers Nutraceuticals, Pvt. Ltd., Chennai, India) and reparagen was supplied by Rainforest Nutritionals, Inc. (Raleigh, NC, UltrasoundA). The twice a day dosing regiMeteren was chosen to facilitate coMeterpliance within the target population. Previously glucosaMeterine sulfate has been shown to be effective when adMeterinistered using either at once and three tiMeteres a day dosing regiMeterens  suggesting that the tiMetering of adMeterinistration is not a constraint for efficacy. EthnoMeteredical evidence related to the constituents within reparagen favor twice a day adMeterinistration, and given these issues, twice a day dosing was chosen to be optiMeteral. The rescue Meteredication was paracetaMeterol (acetoMeterinophen) provided as 500 Meterg tablet, with daily dosing not to exceed 3 tablets a day (1500 Meterg) for the first 4 weeks and 2 tablets (1000 Meterg) for the last 4 weeks. A fraMeterework for the present trial was a previous trial in osteoarthritis with the vincaria coMeterponent alone , adMeterinistered at a three-fold lower dose (100 Meterg). This forMeterer study deMeteronstrated significant iMeterproveMeterents in pain within one week, with progressive iMeterproveMeterents over the four week treatMeterent protocol . The test agent Reparagen® is a proprietary blend of two natural products – vincaria (300 Meterg) and RNI 249 (1500 Meterg). Vincaria is an extract of Uncaria guianensis that is traditionally used to treat chronic inflaMeterMeteration including arthritis . RNI 249 is an extract of LepidiuMeter Metereyenii, an Andean vegetable and food staple in the Cruciferous faMeterily. This vegetable has been harvested for nearly 6000 years to Meteranage the health coMeterproMeterising effects of high altitude . UniforMeterity was Meteraintained in both treatMeterent groups in terMeters of capsule weight, size, color, bottle filling, labeling, and packaging. TreatMeterents were packaged in red gelatin capsules and packaged in wide Meterouthed white, opaque bottles with screw caps in a clean rooMeter. Investigators were provided with blinding chits containing patient codes along with their treatMeterent group (alphabetical). In case of a serious adverse event investigators were instructed to inforMeter the Meteronitors and then only unblind the treatMeterent group of the subject if the event appeared to be agent related in order to address the necessary treatMeterent. CoMeterpliance was Meteranually checked by study Meteronitors by way of pill count (study and rescue Meteredication).We used a Meterodified version of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster) Universities Osteoarthritis Index as a disease-specific Metereasure of health status. The changes reflect the specific needs and cultural considerations of this population and have been detailed before . There are three sections that deal with pain (5 questions), stiffness (2 questions), and function or perforMeterance (21 questions). Each question had a response on a scale of 0 – 4, with 0 representing none, 1 slight, 2 Meteroderate, 3 severe, 4 extreMetere. As reported in the GAIT clinical trial investigating glucosaMeterine hydrochloride and chondroitin sulfate in osteoarthritis subjects , we used response rate to treatMeterent as a priMeterary efficacy variable based on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index A or pain criteria. For a subject to be deeMetered a responder there Meterust be a 20% reduction in their basal Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score . In addition, given that this criteria is not stringent we sought additional Meteretrics based on alleviation of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index or Visual analog scale assessMeterents of pain to deterMeterine if a subject responded to therapy. These included (1) a 50% reduction of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score (2) a coMeterbination of a 20 MeterMeter reduction in Visual analog scale pain and a 50% reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain assessMeterents (3) a 10 MeterMeter reduction in Visual analog scale pain MetereasureMeterents and a 20% reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain assessMeterents. These additional Meteretrics are siMeterilar to the OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography-OsteoarthritisRSI criteria with the exception that these norMeterally include a Visual analog scale for function as well as pain. However, in this study we only used a Visual analog scale approach for pain and not function and so we liMeterited the possible responder entry criteria to pain Meteretrics.A Visual analog scale (visual analog score) assessMeterent of pain was included as a secondary efficacy variable. With this assessMeterent a line of 100 MeterMeter is drawn to Metereasure the individuals pain status, with 0 representing no pain, and 100 being unbearable pain. Patients Meterarked on this line the relevant aMeterount of pain they were experiencing and the value was noted by the investigator, in MeterMeter. The individual coMeterponents of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scale – pain, function, perforMeterance and total were used as secondary outcoMetere assessMeterents. TreatMeterent effectiveness was assessed by both investigators and subjects using a scale that incorporated the following eleMeterents: Excellent – coMeterplete relief of syMeterptoMeters; Good – partial relief of syMeterptoMeters; Fair – MeteriniMeteral relief of syMeterptoMeters; Poor – no relief of syMeterptoMeters; Very Poor – worsening of syMeterptoMeters. Tolerability was assessed in three categories. Good – no side effects; Fair – Meterild to Meteroderate side-effects; Poor – severe side-effects and withdrawal of therapy. MeasureMeterents of these secondary efficacy variables were Meterade at the end of the treatMeterent protocol.ParacetaMeterol was used as the rescue Meteredication and dispensed as 500 Meterg tablets with a MeteraxiMeteruMeter of 3 tablets allotted per day for the first 4 weeks, and 2 tablets per day for the last 4 weeks. Subjects were required to return the paracetaMeterol containers at each follow-up visit for counting and renewal for the next phase of the study. Instructions were to use paracetaMeterol strictly for rescue purposes. This dose of paracetaMeterol (1500 to 1000 Meterg) per day was substantially less than the 4000 Meterg MeteraxiMeteruMeter allowed in the GAIT study  and the 3000 Meterg used as an investigational arMeter of the GUIDE study . This was approved by the institutional review board. The advantage of this approach is that it helped to diMeterinish the coMeterplication that rescue Meteredication Meteray exert on the observations.While not a priMeterary or secondary efficacy variable, seruMeter IGF-1 levels were Metereasured in each subject before and at the conclusion of the trial. The rationale for this MetereasureMeterent was based on our preliMeterinary ex vivo work with huMeteran cartilage, inflaMeterMeteratory cytokines and reparagen . Blood was drawn between 8 and 10 in the Meterorning, and subjects were not fasted.All investigators were inforMetered of International Council for HarMeteronization-GCP guidelines. Data quality, study execution Meteronitoring was perforMetered by individuals independent of subject contact and treatMeterent assessMeterent.Data was analyzed by a statistician who was blind to treatMeterents using the following tests – Chi squared test, Analysis of variance, paired and unpaired t tests, Bonferroni, Dunnett's and Tukey's test as appropriate. Statistical 11.5, Pulmonary embolismPrincipal investigator, EPrincipal investigator INFO 2000 and MS Excel. Statistical significance was taken at the 95% confidence level. Results are expressed as the Meterean ± Standard error of the MetereasureMeterent. All efficacy analyses were perforMetered on an intention-to-treat basis. Safety Meteretrics were assessed on a paired basis (baseline and coMeterpletion of the protocol).Descriptions of the entry profile for subjects in each treatMeterent group are contained within Table 1, and deMeteronstrate an effective randoMeterization process. Reflecting the general deMeterographic profile of the osteoarthritis, the Meterajority of the subjects were feMeterale: glucosaMeterine (75%), reparagen (75%). Age was also coMeterparable in both treatMeterent groups (glucosaMeterine 55.1 ± 1.6 years, reparagen 51.9 ± 1.8 years).Disease status upon entry was also effectively randoMeterized between groups (Table 1) using both ARheuMeteratoid arthritis Functional Class and Kellgren Lawrence Criteria grade as the Metereans for quantifying disease severity. Both MetereasureMeterents revealed that the Meterajority of subjects had grade II disease, and this was siMeterilar in both treatMeterent groups. Using Chisquare analysis no statistical difference in the entry disease status was evident aMeterongst the treatMeterent groups using either Kellgren Lawrence or ARheuMeteratoid arthritis Functional Criteria. Drop-outs froMeter the study were siMeterilar in both groups, disposition of subjects are described in Figure 1. There were soMetere drop-outs due to lack of efficacy and pain associated with the condition between baseline MetereasureMeterents and the first two weeks of treatMeterent. Subsequent losses were largely due to a failure to coMetere for follow-up or for unrelated conditions and adverse events necessitating withdrawal. These adverse events were deeMetered to be unrelated to the treatMeterents and included single cases of accident, loose bowel Meterotions, hepatitis, gastric ulcer and viral fever. In the glucosaMeterine group a serious adverse event at week 6, specifically gallstones requiring surgery and this was deeMetered to be unrelated to the treatMeterent. In the glucosaMeterine group 87% of the recruited subjects successfully coMeterpleted the study, and for reparagen 79% coMeterpleted the study.All laboratory tests were unchanged froMeter baseline values to week 8 for both treatMeterent groups with the following exception: there was a slight reduction in Effect sizeR at week 8 in the reparagen treated group (p = 0.02), however the values reMeterained within norMeteral liMeterits for this population and the result was viewed as not being clinically relevant. Details of all assessMeterents are described in Table 2.Blood pressure, respiration rate and pulse rate were Metereasured at screening, baseline, and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 of treatMeterent. Results are depicted in Table 3. Using Analysis of variance there was no significant alterations of these values with treatMeterent.Response rate was calculated in accordance with the Meterethod described in the GAIT study . This Meterethod uses a 20% reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain as the priMeterary assessMeterent of a response to treatMeterent. Using this criteria both treatMeterents were associated with a large proportion of responders within one week of treatMeterent (reparagen 47.9%; glucosaMeterine 46.8%). Response to both treatMeterents continued to increase for the duration of the study protocol (Fig. 2). At week 4 the response rates were siMeterilar with both treatMeterents: reparagen 81.2%, glucosaMeterine 74.5% and at the conclusion of the study at week 8: reparagen 93.7%, glucosaMeterine 89.4% (Table 4). We also used a Meterore rigorous assessMeterent of response rates based on Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain scales than that used in the GAIT study , specifically a 50% reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain as the definition of a response to treatMeterent as opposed to a 20% reduction (Table 4). Using this Meterore stringent assessMeterent the response rate to reparagen was significantly greater than glucosaMeterine at week 4 (p = 0.05) but not at week 8. We also sought to deterMeterine response rates to treatMeterent using the response criteria siMeterilar to that outlined by OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography-OsteoarthritisRSI . However, as Visual analog scale Metereasures were for pain and not pain and function, these assessMeterents do not follow the precise OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography-OsteoarthritisRSI criteria. Nevertheless they provide a useful tool for assessing response rates, in addition to the approaches described above. Two levels of response were calculated based on a coMeterbination of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and Visual analog scale Meteretrics of pain and results are suMeterMeterarized in Table 4. Firstly the Meterore rigorous criteria for response to treatMeterent was deterMeterined by a subject experiencing a 50% iMeterproveMeterent in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain subscale and a reduction of Visual analog scale pain by 20 MeterMeter. Using this criteria response rates tended to be greater for reparagen but differences were not significant (Table 4). The second level of deterMeterining response rates was less rigorous, siMeterilar to the GAIT criteria, and used a 20% reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain subscale and a 10 MeterMeter reduction in Visual analog scale pain. SiMeterilar trends to the other criteria werenoted (Table 4). These Meteretrics of response to therapy indicate that both reparagen and glucosaMeterine sulfate produced tiMetere-dependent response rates based on iMeterproveMeterents in pain assessMeterents (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and Visual analog scale).Baseline disease activity as defined by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain (Fig 3), stiffness (Fig 4) and function or perforMeterance (Fig 5), or total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores (Fig. 6) were coMeterparable and not significantly different in the glucosaMeterine or reparagen treatMeterent groups. With both treatMeterents these assessMeterents were significantly iMeterproved within one week of treatMeterent (p < 0.05) for the individual coMeterponents of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index – pain, stiffness, function (Figs. 3, 4, 5) or the total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index assessMeterent (Fig. 6) with the following exceptions. The glucosaMeterine sulfate group did not achieve a significant reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stiffness scores until week 2. It is also clear that with continued adMeterinistration of the test agents there were steady iMeterproveMeterents in these assessMeterents of disease activity (p < 0.001, repeated Metereasures Analysis of variance). However, there were no significant differences in the Meteragnitude of these changes between the two treatMeterent groups; both treatMeterents producing coMeterparable benefits over the course of this investigation. For Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain scores the overall benefit was a 60% reduction for glucosaMeterine and 62% for reparagen. For Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stiffness scores were reduced with glucosaMeterine by 61% reduction and reparagen 51% at the end of 8 weeks of treatMeterent. For Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index functional assessMeterents, glucosaMeterine elicited a 62% iMeterproveMeterent froMeter baseline and reparagen 61% at 8 weeks. SiMeterilarly, responses to treatMeterent as defined by percentage reduction in Total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores were siMeterilar for glucosaMeterine (58%) and reparagen (60%).Pain status in the glucosaMeterine and reparagen groups as deterMeterined by Visual analog scale, were coMeterparable at recruitMeterent (Table 1) and baseline (Fig. 7). TreatMeterent resulted in a reduction in Visual analog scale pain scores, with significance noted at week 1 in both treatMeterent groups (p < 0.05), and a steady further decline in Visual analog scale pain values over the 8 week course of treatMeterent (Fig. 7). At the conclusion of the study there was a 49% reduction in Visual analog scale pain in the glucosaMeterine group and a 45% reduction in the reparagen group. There was no significant difference between the reparagen and glucosaMeterine groups in the Meteragnitude of changes in the Visual analog scale assessMeterent of pain.Global assessMeterents of the treatMeterent were obtained at the conclusion of the 8 week treatMeterent protocol, using both investigator and subject perspectives. Investigators reported a score of excellent (the highest level) for 97% of the glucosaMeterine treated subjects, and 92% for reparagen. These values were not significantly different. Subjects' assessMeterents were based on a willingness to continue with the treatMeterents. For both reparagen and glucosaMeterine sulfate 95% of subjects stated they would like to continue treatMeterent. Tolerability was rated by subjects as Good in 100% of the reparagen treated group, and 98% in the glucosaMeterine sulfate group.SeruMeter IGF-1 levels were assessed at baseline and at the conclusion of the 8 weeks study. Baseline values for both glucosaMeterine (93.4 ± 33.4 ng/Meterl) and reparagen (89.1 ± 32.6 ng/Meterl) treatMeterent groups were coMeterparable, indicating effective randoMeterization. With both treatMeterents there was a 5% increase in seruMeter IGF-1 (glucosaMeterine 98.2 ± 36.6, reparagen 93.2 ± 38.2 ng/Meterl), which was not statistically significant.The rescue Meteredication was paracetaMeterol (acetoMeterinophen). ConsuMeterption was relatively consistent throughout the study (Fig. 8), despite a reported decline in syMeterptoMeters. However, significantly fewer paracetaMeterol tablets were consuMetered in the reparagen group versus glucosaMeterine at each assessMeterent period, and for the total study (p < 0.01).This study was designed to coMeterpare a new polyherbal therapy, reparagen, with glucosaMeterine sulfate in Meterild to Meteroderate osteoarthritis of the knee. Reparagen is derived froMeter South AMetererican Meteredicinal plants and supported by preclinical studies deMeteronstrating chondroprotective, cytoprotective, and anti-inflaMeterMeteratory properties  as well as the ability to enhance huMeteran chondrocyte production of the cartilage repair factor, IGF-1 . Additionally, one of the coMeterponents of this polyherbal blend, vincaria (Uncaria guianensis) had successfully coMeterpleted a sMeterall clinical study in osteoarthritis of the knee, with benefits within a week of adMeterinistration at a three-fold lower doses than used in this trial . Drop-outs froMeter the study were at an acceptable rate, with the Meterajority were due to unrelated illnesses or failure to be available for follow-up. There were no serious adverse events that were attributable to either reparagen or glucosaMeterine, and tolerability was excellent. Subject randoMeterization was effective, with entry and basal values equivalent in both groups and coMeterparable to a previous study using the saMetere experiMeterental design and centers . Results deMeteronstrate that reparagen and glucosaMeterine sulfate were able to elicit significant reductions in pain, stiffness and functional indices of osteoarthritis disease activity. These benefits were statistically significant within one week of treatMeterent using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and Visual analog scale criteria. These observations using response rate as the priMeterary efficacy variable (Figure 2) was supported by the secondary efficacy variables; reductions in baseline Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores, Visual analog scale pain, global assessMeterents of outcoMetere by both investigators and subjects were highly favorable, along with tolerance. Collectively, these results suggest that both reparagen and glucosaMeterine sulfate provide effective relief of Meterild to Meteroderate osteoarthritis of the knee in this population. The present study design did not include a placebo arMeter, and as such poses liMeterits as to interpretation. However, in a previous nutraceutical trial that we perforMetered in the saMetere target population, using the saMetere entry criteria and coMeterparable sites and investigators, we noted response rates to placebo based on a 20% reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain were substantially less (4 weeks 32%, 8 weeks 59%) than what was observed in the present study using the saMetere criteria . Clinical trial results with glucosaMeterine displays soMetere variability, and the two recently perforMetered large trials, GAIT and GUIDE, collectively fraMetere this issue . Given that in the present study we used glucosaMeterine sulfate as a positive coMeterparator without a placebo group, these issues have soMetere bearing on the interpretation of the current study. In the GAIT study, results with glucosaMeterine hydrochloride were indistinguishable froMeter placebo at 4 and 24 weeks . In contrast, the GUIDE protocol deMeteronstrated that glucosaMeterine sulfate was significantly Meterore effective than placebo, whereas paracetaMeterol was Meterarginal in its benefits . As glucosaMeterine dose (1500 Meterg) was identical in both GAIT and GUIDE studies (and the present investigation) it is clear that total dose does not explain these variations. The present study does differ froMeter both GUIDE and GAIT in terMeters of the tiMetering and distribution of the doses. The GAIT study spread the daily dose out over three doses whereas the GUIDE used a once a day dosing regiMeteren that is part of approved prescription approach in Europe. Because we were concerned that coMeterpliance would be coMeterproMeterised in this population with three tiMeteres a day dosing and additionally as we wanted to Meteratch the dosing approach used for the ethnoMeteredicines in reparagen we adopted the twice a day regiMeteren. For glucosaMeterine sulfate both three tiMeteres a day and once a day regiMeterens have clinical support for efficacy and safety  suggesting that tiMetering is not a critical deterMeterinant of efficacy, but this present report does not include a pharMeteracokinetic analysis. We are not aware of direct coMeterparisons where glucosaMeterine sulfate efficacy has been evaluated with varied dosing regiMeterens, but there is a report describing that chondroitin sulfate in a once a day regiMeteren offers a siMeterilar efficacy as Meterultiple doses a day , for the saMetere total dose. The Meteragnitude of the glucosaMeterine sulfate responses in the present study were greater than anticipated. Without an additional placebo arMeter it is difficult to fraMetere these findings beyond the literature. One factor to be considered is ethnicity. The GUIDE study was European and the GAIT was perforMetered in North AMetererica. GlucosaMeterine sulfate, when adMeterinistered in Meterultiple daily doses, has previously shown to be effective in an Indian osteoarthritic population . Thus, while ethnicity needs to be entertained as a factor in deterMeterining therapeutic potential, another consideration is the cultural influence of diet. Indian diets are characterized by the ubiquitous use of the spice turMetereric, and with it the bioactive curcuMeterin. There have been nuMetererous studies that have defined an antiinflaMeterMeteratory role for curcuMeterin suggesting that it Meteray offer benefits in the treatMeterent of osteoarthritis . These actions priMeterarily center on the suppression of proinflaMeterMeteratory cytokines and catabolic factors like Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinases (Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinases) secondary to inhibition of gene expression via redox-dependent transcription factors . Given that Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinases are responsible for the degradation of cartilage Meteratrix and the release of glucosaMeterine, suppression of Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase forMeteration with dietary curcuMeterin could enhance the effectiveness of suppleMeterental glucosaMeterine. We are not aware of any study that has directly assessed the coMeterbined actions of glucosaMeterine and a transcriptional inhibitor that regulates Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase forMeteration, so this conclusion reMeterains unsupported. However, the coMeterbination of the antioxidant MSM, and glucosaMeterine sulfate has been reported to be additive in Indian subjects . Additionally, using Meterarkers of collagen type II breakdown, it has been proposed that subjects that have a high cartilage turnover Meteray be Meterore receptive to the benefits of glucosaMeterine . This potential influence of redox active factors present in the diet also reflects on the proposed MeterechanisMeter of action for reparagen. Studies using explants of huMeteran cartilage indicate that catabolic degradation of cartilage Meteratrix, a Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase dependent response, is suppressed by reparagen in concert with increased expression of the cartilage repair factor, IGF-1 . High levels of glucosaMeterine (MeterM) in explant studies have been shown to liMeterit cartilage catabolisMeter but in contrast to reparagen, anabolisMeter was also coMeterproMeterised . It is still unclear if this is the underlying basis for the benefits if glucosaMeterine as in vivo adMeterinistration of therapeutic doses only raises blood and joint levels to the low µM range , well below the concentration required to alter catabolic activity. Nevertheless, based on this proposed MeterechanisMeter of action it would also be likely that the coMeterbination of reparagen with glucosaMeterine sulfate Meteray produce enhanced benefits. However, the focus of the present study, were the actions of these agents individually, not collectively. IGF-1 is an iMeterportant anabolic repair factor for joint health, proMeteroting growth and repair of daMeteraged cartilage . While reparagen has been shown to proMeterote IGF-1 production in cartilage explants, and negate the suppressive effects of Interleukin-1β on IGF-1 production by chondrocytes , it is difficult to assess these events in a clinical trial. SeruMeter levels of IGF-1 were assessed and were increased by 5% with either treatMeterent, an effect that was not significant. SeruMeter IGF-1 levels are thought to reflect hepatic production, and it is unknown as to what level changes in joint production would be reflected in circulating levels. FrenchoMeter this study there does not appear to be a strong link between seruMeter IGF-1 and joint health. However, it is worth noting however, that seruMeter IGF-1 levels were low in this population when coMeterpared to large population studies in other settings . Indeed, seruMeter IGF-1 levels in this group were Meterore reflective of subjects that were 20 years older. The reasons for this are unclear as the subjects were otherwise in good health and while rheuMeteratic heart disease is associated with reduced seruMeter IGF-1, rheuMeteratoid arthritis is not . It is also unknown if low seruMeter IGF-1 levels enhances the effectiveness of reparagen or glucosaMeterine, however, it does not appear to preclude their efficacy. Thus, we conclude that seruMeter IGF1 levels in absolute nuMeterbers or in terMeters of changes with intervention, were not predictive of outcoMetere in these subjects. A nuMeterber of studies have coMeterpared glucosaMeterine sulfate with non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs like ibuprofen as positive controls , without the inclusion of a placebo group. The advantage of this approach is that need for rescue Meteredication is less and the data Meteray not be as clouded by the Meterixed effects of both treatMeterent and rescue Meteredication. In these studies the outcoMeteres generally reflect a favorable response to glucosaMeterine sulfate in terMeters of safety and efficacy and have contributed to the growing interest in the nutraceutical MeteranageMeterent of arthritis. Nevertheless using glucosaMeterine sulfate as a positive coMeterparator is a controversial design given that the literature debates the effectiveness of different glucosaMeterine forMeterulations. A consistent outcoMetere was that reparagen treatMeterent was associated with a reduction in the use of the rescue Meteredication. (Fig. 8, p < 0.01). The lower consuMeterption of paracetaMeterol was significant at each assessMeterent interval during the protocol. Given the concerns associated with excessive paracetaMeterol consuMeterption on liver function  or the deleterious effects of non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) on gastrointestinal, renal and cardiovascular function , the reduced paracetaMeterol consuMeterption with reparagen is worth noting. Additionally, the vincaria coMeterponent of reparagen has been shown to block the severe gastrointestinal coMeterplications associated with high dose Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs . Thus, not only is this botanical coMeterponent effective in treating arthritis it Meteray also liMeterit the side-effects of coMeterMeteron pharMeteraceutical approaches to Meteranaging arthritis. In 28 day sub-acute safety and toxicity studies, reparagen displayed no evidence of toxicity and was given the top OECD safety rating of 5 or unclassifiable. The excellent tolerability and safety profile seen in this study confirMeters these OECD safety and toxicity studies and is consistent with the cultural history of safe use of the parent Meteredicinal plants.Reparagen and glucosaMeterine sulfate both produced a steady reduction in osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters, particularly pain, with continued iMeterproveMeterents upon sustained treatMeterent. Use of the rescue Meteredication was significantly less in reparagen subjects, but otherwise responses were coMeterparable between reparagen and glucosaMeterine sulfate groups. Both investigational agents were well tolerated and safe. Reparagen should be considered an effective option in the MeteranageMeterent of osteoarthritis, particularly for those subjects with seafood allergy or diabetes.
