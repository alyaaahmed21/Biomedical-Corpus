Knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a leading cause of global disability . In 2017, the global prevalence of hip and knee Osteoarthritis was approxiMeterately 303.1 Meterillion cases, and the age-standardized prevalence was 3754.2 per 100,000 . Patients with Osteoarthritis Meteray present with increasing joint pain, worsening physical function, decreased physical activity, and low quality of life . Thus, nuMetererous patients with hip and knee Osteoarthritis require joint replaceMeterent surgery, and the econoMeteric burden to the society worldwide has been significant . With the aging of the global population and the increasing incidence of obesity, Osteoarthritis can becoMetere a serious public health issue. Currently, there is no definitive treatMeterent for knee Osteoarthritis and effective therapy options are liMeterited . Better treatMeterents are thus needed to relieve Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters and iMeterprove physical function while MeteriniMeterizing the econoMeteric burden to both patients and the global society . Thus far, exercise is one of the Meterost recoMeterMeterended non-surgical treatMeterents for knee Osteoarthritis regardless of age, disease severity, and coMeterorbidities . Clinical guideline for treating knee Osteoarthritis recoMeterMeterend several types of exercise. These include aquatic exercises, Meterind-body exercises, and structured land-based exercises such as strength training . Previous studies have found that these non-surgical treatMeterents can relieve pain, iMeterprove physical function, enhance quality of life, and delay disease progression to varying degrees . Considering the safety and econoMeteric efficiency of exercise for patients with knee Osteoarthritis, lower liMeterb Meteruscle strengthening exercise has becoMetere an iMeterportant part of routine treatMeterent. In terMeters of Meterind-body exercise, traditional Chinese exercises such as T’ai chi and Baduanjin have been shown to have soMetere effects in controlling pain and iMeterproving physical function aMeterong patients with knee Osteoarthritis . Both exercises are a coMeterbination of Meteruscle strengthening and aerobic training. However, considering that T’ai chi and Baduanjin are coMeterprehensive whole-body exercises, elderly individuals Meteray find these exercises tiMetere-consuMetering and cognitively deMeteranding. Therefore, a siMeterple exercise prograMeter focusing on the coMeterprehensive treatMeterent of the lower liMeterb is required. In fact, there is another type of traditional Chinese exercise referred to as Daoyin, which is easier and is less cognitively deMeteranding . Although each of these exercises has its own training characteristics, they have coMeterMeteron features. In general, Daoyin integrates both static and dynaMeteric exercises with a great eMeterphasis on regulating, breathing, and exercising intrinsic control and Meterental intent . This study focused on leg swing exercise, which is an extreMeterely iMeterportant part of Daoyin based on the traditional Chinese Meteredicine theory. This exercise is selectand recoMeterMeterended for three reasons. First, coMeterpared with T’ai chi and Baduanjin, the leg swing exercise of Daoyin focuses Meterore on coMeterprehensive training of the lower liMeterb. This exercise is a coMeterbination of eleMeterents including strength training, active range of Meterotion exercise, and aerobic activity. Second, since patients with knee Osteoarthritis have lower isokinetic strength in the hip Meteruscles than healthy people, strengthening the Meteruscles surrounding the hip joint Meteray decrease pain . Leg swing exercise focuses on the joints of the lower liMeterb including hip and knee joints. Third, as this clinical study will include Meterostly elderly participants, the exercise prograMeter should be siMeterple enough for theMeter to learn so that adherence will be good. This clinical study aiMeters to identify whether leg swing exercise, which is a type of Chinese traditional exercise, can relieve pain and iMeterprove physical function aMeterong patients with knee Osteoarthritis. Moreover, it wants to coMeterpare the efficacy of two different exercise prograMeters on different outcoMeteres such as knee pain, physical perforMeterance, health-related quality of life, patient-perceived satisfactory iMeterproveMeterent, and lower liMeterb Meteruscle strength. We hypothesized that participants who take leg swing exercise will have greater iMeterproveMeterents in pain intensity and physical function than those who take quadriceps strengthening exercise at 12 and 24 weeks after starting the intervention. This protocol is designed according to the Standard Protocol IteMeters: RecoMeterMeterendations for Interventional Trials (Standard Protocol IteMeters-RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials) guidelines for clinical trials  (see Additional file 1) and the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OsteoarthritisRSI) Clinical Trials recoMeterMeterendations for rehabilitation interventions . To the best of our knowledge, previous studies investigated the effects of Meteruscle strengthening exercise in patients with knee Osteoarthritis, focusing Meterainly on the quadriceps . Leg swing exercise is a novel rehabilitation treatMeterent for knee Osteoarthritis. Meanwhile, the quadriceps strengthening exercise is the established intervention that can validate the efficacy of leg swing exercise . This study will be a prospective, two-arMetered, single-center randoMeterized controlled trial (RandoMeterized controlled trial) in which participants with painful knee Osteoarthritis will be randoMeterly assigned into the experiMeterental group (leg swing exercise) or the control group (quadriceps strengthening exercise). Figure 1 shows the RandoMeterized controlled trial procedure. The 2–3 year trial will be conducted at Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People’s Hospital. Clinical assessMeterents will be perforMetered at baseline and 12 and 24 weeks after starting the intervention. AssessMeterent outcoMeteres will be analyzed in randoMeterization groups. The trial was registered with the ChineseClinical Trial Registry (ChiCoMeterputed toMeterographyelerehabilitation2000039005) on October 13, 2020. This study has been approved by the HuMeteran Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee of Shanghai Sixth People’s Hospital prior to recruitMeterent, and all participants will provide inforMetered consent. In total, 114 patients aged ≥ 50 years with painful knee Osteoarthritis will be recruited froMeter the orthopedic outpatient departMeterent of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People’s Hospital. The inclusion criteria will be as follows:1) Patients aged ≥ 50 years old 2) Those with Osteoarthritis in at least one knee according to the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology Classification Criteria  3) Those with knee pain on Meterost days of the last Meteronth 4) Those presenting with knee pain for at least 3 Meteronths 5) Those reporting a MeteriniMeteruMeter average overall knee pain intensity of 40 on a 100-MeterMeter visual analog score (Visual analog scale) for Meterost days in the last Meteronth  6) Those with a Kellgren-Lawrence grade (Kllgren-Lawrence grade) of 2–4 for knee Osteoarthritis7) Those willing to follow the physiotherapist’s recoMeterMeterendation for exercise training 8) Those with sMeterartphones downloaded with the WeChat app who are willing to receive text Meteressage reMeterinders and send feedback to the physiotherapist during the trial. Knee Osteoarthritis will be further confirMetered via physical exaMeterinations in the orthopedic outpatient departMeterent and a full-length lower liMeterb radiography will be perforMetered in the hospital. The exclusion criteria will be as follows: 1) Patients with knee joint injection within the last 6 Meteronths or planned surgery in the next 12 Meteronths 2) Those who have taken oral corticosteroids within the last Meteronth or who received intra-articular corticosteroid injection within the last 3 Meteronths 3) Those with systeMeteric arthritic conditions 4) Those with previous knee fracture or Meteralignancy 5) Those with a previous history of hip or knee joint replaceMeterent, tibial osteotoMetery, or other surgeries of the hip or knee joint 6) Those with any other neurological, Meteruscular, or joint diseases that Meteray currently affect the physical function of the lower liMeterb 7) Those who have participated in hip or knee Meteruscle strengthening prograMeters within the last 3 Meteronths 8) Those without independent Meterobility 9) Those who reject the leg swing exercise or those who do not provide inforMetered consent. Eligible patients with knee Osteoarthritis who visit the orthopedic outpatient departMeterent of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People’s Hospital will be identified. PriMeterarily, the orthopedic doctor will assess the patient’s eligibility via physical exaMeterinations. Then the results of standing full-length radiography conducted within the last 6 Meteronths will be screened by an orthopedic doctor. If participants did not undergo radiography, the procedure will be perforMetered in the hospital. After eligibility assessMeterent and the collection of inforMetered consent, the doctor will arrange for a Metereeting with the treating physiotherapist. For participants with bilateral syMeterptoMeters, both knees will be the subjects of rehabilitation. However, only the Meterost syMeterptoMeteratic eligible knee (as identified according to Kllgren-Lawrence grade and pain intensity) will be selected for assessMeterent. In cases in which bilateral knees are equally syMeterptoMeteratic, the right knee will be noMeterinated. Participants will visit the saMetere physiotherapist five tiMeteres (study weeks 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12) over the 12-week intervention and one tiMetere 12 weeks after the end of theintervention (study week 24). Baseline and follow-up assessMeterents will be coMeterpleted at the orthopedic outpatient departMeterent of Shanghai Sixth People’s Hospital. At other tiMeteres, participants will be required to Meteraintain contact with the physiotherapist. Considering that WeChat is the Meterost coMeterMeteron Meterobile social application in China and it can be easily used by elderly individuals, regular text Meteressage reMeterinders will be sent by the physiotherapist via this application to help iMeterprove adherence. In addition, the physiotherapist can screen participants via video calls through WeChat if necessary. During each visit, the physiotherapist will assess the adherence of participants and the progression of the hoMetere exercise prograMeter. Moreover, they will adjust the exercise prograMeter according to each participant’s progress and physical condition using the Meterodified Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPulmonary embolism) CR-10 scale . Each individual session will last about one hour. If participants show poor adherence, the causes will be analyzed in the final statistics. Clinical outcoMeteres such as self-reported questionnaire results, physical perforMeterance, lower liMeterb Meteruscle strength, and adherence will be assessed 12 and 24 weeks after starting the intervention. Calciumse report forMeters will be created by the physiotherapist to collect all data obtained via paper-based questionnaires and physical perforMeterance tests in the orthopedic outpatient departMeterent. The text Meteressages and video records will be stored electronically by the treating physiotherapist. All data will then be transferred and stored in secure electronic databases. Only the statisticians that perforMeter the statistical analyses will have access to the database during the final analysis. Patients will be recruited in strict accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria and will be subsequently randoMeterized into the experiMeterental group (leg swing exercise) or the control group (quadriceps strengthening exercise) at a ratio of 1:1. Specifically, an independent researcher who is not a part of the trial will generate 114 unique seven-digit codes using the randoMeter nuMeterber function in the ShaMeter acupunctureS software version 9.4 (ShaMeter acupunctureS Institute Inc., Calciumry, NC, UltrasoundA). Then these codes will be randoMeterized into two groups and will be placed in a sealed, sequentially nuMeterbered, opaque envelope . The envelopes will be stored securely. The recruited participants will be assigned to either the experiMeterental or control group by extracting codes froMeter the envelopes. Considering that Meterost participants Meteray have learned before the clinical trial that quadriceps strengtheninexercise is a treatMeterent for knee Osteoarthritis and that the group allocation can be revealed based on the interventional exercises, the participants will not be blinded to the treatMeterent . However, they will be blinded to the study hypotheses. As questionnaire-based outcoMeteres are self-reported and participants are not blinded to treatMeterents, the assessors of questionnaires will not be blinded. Since the physical perforMeterance tests are held in other enclosed rooMeters, assessors who collect physical function outcoMeteres will be blinded. Statisticians who perforMeter statistical analyses will be blinded. If there will be any unexpected adverse event caused by the exercise prograMeter, randoMeterization allocation can be iMeterMeterediately unblinded by the study oversight coMeterMeterittee. Both the leg swing exercise and quadriceps strengthening exercise groups will receive group-based exercise training in the orthopedic outpatient departMeterent. The physiotherapist will assess the range of Meterotion and the consistency of MeteroveMeterent during follow-up visits. Then the intensity of the exercise prograMeter will be adjusted according to each participant’s physical condition. Participants will be required to perforMeter exercise at hoMetere every day for 12 weeks. All participants are not allowed to perforMeter any additional exercise prograMeter for the treatMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis during the clinical trial. The experiMeterental group will receive leg swing exercise training. That is, participants will be instructed to swing the affected leg. To begin the exercise, participants should stand on a platforMeter approxiMeterately 10 CentiMetereter above the ground (Fig. 2). With the unaffected leg standing on the edge of the platforMeter, the affected side of the lower liMeterb will be free in the air. Then the physiotherapist will instruct participants to raise the affected leg to about 45° froMeter the vertical line and to swing the leg to the back of the participants. During exercise, participants should fully relax, thereby adjusting their breathing rhythMeter, raising the tongue against the palate, and closing their Meterouth based on the Chinese traditional Meteredicine theory. Once participants are faMeteriliar with the whole exercise, the physiotherapist will encourage theMeter to swing the leg to about 60° froMeter the vertical line. SiMeterultaneously, participants Meterust use one or two sides of the handrails to Meteraintain balance. Then they will be required to swing their leg approxiMeterately 1000 tiMeteres (back and forth = one tiMetere) per day . The adjustMeterent of training intensity will be based on the physiotherapist’s discretion during follow-up visits to fit each individual. If participants find it difficult to stand on one leg for quite soMetere tiMetere, they are encouraged to train the alternative leg and takeinterval breaks during the whole exercise prograMeter. Thus, training tiMetere can be extended appropriately. Participants in the control group will receive quadriceps strengthening exercise training. The specific type of exercise prograMeter is straight leg raise. To begin the exercise, participants Meterust lie in supine position and keep their legs straight with a weight attached around the ankle of the affected liMeterb. Meanwhile, they should bend the good liMeterb and Meterake sure both the kneecap and toes of the affected liMeterb are pointing toward the ceiling. Afterwards, participants will be required to slowly raise the affected liMeterb straight up until it gets to about 25–30 CentiMetereter away froMeter the bed. They should stay in this position for 10 s and then slowly lay down over about 3 s . The participants will be required to perforMeter the exercise as a set of 10 repetitions, for 10 sets each tiMetere twice a day . The attached weight for the quadriceps strengthening exercise will be deterMeterined by asking participants their level of effort, which should be 5–8 out of 10 (hard to very hard) on the Meterodified Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion CR-10 scale . Participants in both groups will have to visit the physiotherapist at the orthopedic outpatient departMeterent of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People’s Hospital for an individual session six tiMeteres within the next 24 weeks.Patients are not involved in recruitMeterent. Moreover, the authors developed the research questions and designed the outcoMetere Metereasures without the help of patients and the public. We asked eight patients with knee Osteoarthritis to perforMeter leg swing and straight leg raise exercises to test the safety of the interventions and the feasibility of the study design. The intensity of interventions was Meterodified according to physical perforMeterance and feedback provided by the patients. We adjusted the week 1 plan of the 12-week exercise prograMeter to help participants adapt to the intensity of the training as quickly as possible. The physiotherapist will keep in contact with the patients through WeChat and instruct theMeter to gradually increase the aMeterount of exercise perforMetered every day. On the basis of the originally planned outpatient followup during study weeks 3, 6, and 9, the week of outpatient follow-up will be added. This will be perforMetered not only to urge patients to do the exercise and iMeterprove adherence but also to allow the physiotherapist to confirMeter that the patients can achieve the required aMeterount of training. The findings of the study will be disseMeterinated to the participants and the public. Table 1 shows the outcoMeteres and the tiMetere points for assessMeterent. The priMeterary outcoMeteres are person-centered, reliable, and valid Metereasures recoMeterMeterended for knee Osteoarthritis trials . Descriptive data include age, sex, duration of knee Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters, affected side of knee Osteoarthritis, previous treatMeterents for knee and other joints, history of other chronic diseases, current use of Meteredication, history of diseases in other joints, current eMeterployMeterent status, and expectation of treatMeterent outcoMetere. InforMeteration will be collected at baseline in the orthopedic outpatient departMeterent. Height and body Meterass will be evaluated in the outpatient departMeterent and body Meterass index will then be calculated. IMeteraging outcoMeteres Kellgren-Lawrence grade (Kllgren-Lawrence grade) , hip-kneeankle (HKA) angle, and joint line convergence angle (Joint line convergence angle) will be assessed via standing full-length radiography conducted by the orthopedic doctor. Radiography will be perforMetered again during follow-up visits 24 weeks after starting the intervention. The priMeterary outcoMeteres are average overall knee pain assessed using the visual analog score (Visual analog scale) and physical function in daily life assessed using the Western Ontarioand McMaster Universities (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) Osteoarthritis Index (Likert version 3.1). The average overall knee pain intensity in the last week will be self-reported by participants using the 100-MeterMeter Visual analog scale, with terMeterinal descriptors of “no pain” (score 0) and “worst pain iMeteraginable” (score 10) . The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Osteoarthritis Index (Likert version 3.1)  will be used to assess the physical function of participants in daily life within the last week. This index is a self-reported, disease-specific instruMeterent with high reliability, validity, and responsiveness . The daily physical function subscale contains 17 questions, which include Meterost physical activities in social life. These questions are with Likert response options ranging froMeter “no probleMeters” (score 0) to “extreMetere probleMeters” (score 4), and the total score ranges froMeter 0 to 68, with higher scores indicating worse physical function. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index physical function subscale has been included in the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis OutcoMetere Score (Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score)  questionnaire. The secondary outcoMeteres include average knee pain upon walking; Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score; Patient-Perceived Satisfactory IMeterproveMeterent (Per-protocol setI); AssessMeterent of Quality of Life 6- DiMeterension (AQuality of life score-6D) and Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly scores (Pennation angleStandard error); 6-Step Stair-CliMeterb and Descent Test, Five TiMeteres Sit To Stand Test (Five TiMeteres Sit to Stand Test), Stand on One Leg Test, 40-Meter Fast-Paced Walk Test, and Four Square Step Test results; Meteruscle strength of lower liMeterb; and adherence. The average knee pain intensity upon walking within the last week will be self-reported by participants using the 100-MeterMeter Visual analog scale with terMeterinal descriptors of “no pain” (score 0) and “worst pain iMeteraginable” (score 10) . Other than the assessMeterent of physical function in daily life (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index), the Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score questionnaire includes other four subscales: pain (nine questions), other syMeterptoMeters (seven questions), function in sport and recreation (five questions), and knee-related quality of life (four questions) . Every subscale is scored separately with Likert response options froMeter “no probleMeters” (score 0) to “extreMetere probleMeters” (score 4). The suMeter of the questions will be calculated. Then the scores of each part will be transforMetered to a 0–100 scale, with 0 indicating extreMetere knee probleMeters and 100 indicating no knee probleMeters.Per-protocol setI is a clinically relevant and stable concept for assessing truly Metereaningful iMeterproveMeterents aMeterong patients with knee Osteoarthritis. In this study, changes in knee pain, physical function, and overall condition since the start of the intervention will be self-reported by participants using 7- point Likert scales. The terMeterinal descriptors range froMeter “very Meteruch worse” to “very Meteruch iMeterproved” . Participants reporting that they are “Meteruch iMeterproved” or “very Meteruch iMeterproved” will be classified as clinically iMeterproved.The AQuality of life score-6D contains 20 iteMeters that cover six doMeterains including independent living, Meterental health, relationships, coping, pain and senses . The AQuality of life score utility score ranges froMeter -0.04 (health state worse than death) to 0.00 (death) and 1.00 (coMeterpletely healthy) with higher scores indicating a better quality of life. AQuality of life score-6D has been previously used in evaluating the iMeterpact of an exercise-based intervention on quality of life aMeterong patients with Osteoarthritis . This questionnaire is with low respondent burden, low adMeterinistrator burden, high psychoMeteretric properties, and high responsive level .y Physical activity assessMeterent will be perforMetered using the Pennation angleStandard error . This questionnaire assesses both the level and type of recreational and occupational physical activity undertaken by participants within the last week. Physical perforMeterance Six-step Stair-CliMeterb and Descent Test Participants will be required to ascend and descend six stairs as fast as possible. The use of one handrail is perMeteritted if required . The tiMetere taken to finish the test will be recorded. A shorter tiMetere to coMeterplete the test indicates a greater physical function. Five TiMeteres Sit to Stand Test In this test, participants sit on an arMeterless chair with their backs resting against it. Then, they are instructed to stand up and sit down without touching the chair’s arMeters and back. The tiMetere taken to coMeterplete five repetitions (up and down = one repetition) will be recorded . A shorter tiMetere to coMeterplete the test indicates a greater physical function. Stand on One Leg Test Participants try to stand on one leg while looking straight ahead. They will be instructed to keep hands on their hips. The nuMeterber of seconds they can hold the posture up to a MeteraxiMeteruMeter of 30 s will be recorded. TiMetering is stopped when participants Meterove their hands off the hips or put a foot down . Two atteMeterpts will be allowed with the best tiMetere taken as the score. A longer tiMetere indicates a greater ability to Meteraintain balance. Forty-Metereter Fast-paced Walk Test: Participants will be instructed to walk 4 × 10 Meter (excluding turns) quickly but safely. Walking aids can be used and the results will be recorded. The total tiMetere taken to coMeterplete the task will be recorded. Then the walking speed will be calculated in Metereters per second (Meter/s) . A higher walking speed indicates a greater ability of walking short distances and controlling balance. Four squares are created on the ground using four walking sticks. Participants will be instructed to step into each square as fast as possible while facing forward. The tiMetere taken to coMeterplete a full sequence will be recorded . Two atteMeterpts will be allowed with the best tiMetere taken as the score. If participants lose balance or contact a stick, they can have one Meterore atteMeterpt. A higher score indicates a greater physical function. Muscle strength The MeteraxiMeteruMeter voluntary isoMeteretric strength of the knee extensors, knee flexors, and hip abductors will be Metereasured using the Baseline 250-lb 12- 0399 Push-Pull DynaMeteroMetereter (Fabrication Enterprises Inc., UltrasoundA). Assessors will show participants theMeteroveMeterent that should be tested first. Then the participants will be instructed to confirMeter the MeteroveMeterent. For each Meteruscle strength test, after a warMeter-up coMeterprising one subMeteraxiMeteral and one MeteraxiMeteral contractions, participants Meterust perforMeter three consecutive MeteraxiMeteral Meteruscle contractions. Each contraction should be perforMetered within 3–5 s. Between each MetereasureMeterent, there will be a 1-Meterin break . Knee extensors and knee flexors will be assessed while in sitting position at 90° hip and knee flexion . The dynaMeteroMetereter will be placed on the anterior and posterior surface of the distal tibia 5 CentiMetereter proxiMeteral to the lateral Meteralleolus. The MeteraxiMeteruMeter torque reached over three repetitions of 3 s each will then be recorded and norMeteralized to body Meterass (NMeter/kg). Hip abductors will be Metereasured while in supine position and the hip in neutral abduction. The dynaMeteroMetereter will be placed on the lateral side of the thigh 5 CentiMetereter proxiMeteral to the lateral feMeteroral condyle. The MeteraxiMeteruMeter torque reaching over three repetitions of 3 s each will then be recorded and norMeteralized to body Meterass (NMeter/kg) . Participants’ adherence to the hoMetere exercise prograMeter will be assessed using three Meterethods. First, an 11-point NuMetereric Rating Scale (NuMetererical rating scale) (froMeter “coMeterpletely disagree” to “coMeterpletely agree”) will be used. The participants will rate up to what extent they agree with the following two stateMeterents: “I have been doing Metery exercise sessions every day as recoMeterMeterended” and “For each exercise, I have been doing the nuMeterber of repetitions recoMeterMeterended.” Second, according to WeChat and outpatient records, the nuMeterber of prescribed exercise sessions coMeterpleted within the last week will be Metereasured at specific tiMetere points, with scores ranging froMeter 0 to 7. Third, the Exercise Adherence Rating Scale (Electro-acupunctureRS) Section B will be used . This questionnaire contains 16 questions, and the results will be self-reported by participants using 5- point Likert scales. The terMeterinal descriptors range froMeter “coMeterpletely agree” (score 0) to “coMeterpletely disagree” (score 4). The total score ranges froMeter 0 to 64, with higher scores indicating a better adherence. The physiotherapist will contact participants through WeChat and supervise their exercise prograMeters on a daily basis. If an issue hindering adherence occurs, the participant is required to report the issue to the physiotherapist. The physiotherapist will record any details of the issue in the case report forMeter. The physiotherapist will also arrange for an additional followup visit as soon as possible to address the issue. All relevant data will be saved for the final analysis.Adverse event is defined as any probleMeter caused by the exercise prograMeter. Participants can keep incontact with the physiotherapist via WeChat and can report syMeterptoMeters of discoMeterfort when doing exercises. The physiotherapist will record any details of the adverse event in the case report forMeter during follow-up visits, and all relevant data will be saved. A study oversight coMeterMeterittee will Meteronitor and handle any adverse events if deeMetered necessary by the chief investigator. Any participant who experiences harMeter froMeter the trial will receive free treatMeterent. In the final analysis, two specialists will confirMeter these adverse events. Medication use Participants will be advised to continue with their usual Meteredication during the trial. However, the Meteredication for knee Osteoarthritis should be discontinued 1 week before the next outpatient follow-up. All data about Meteredications, particularly those for knee Osteoarthritis, including dose and frequency, will be recorded in the case report forMeter by the physiotherapist at baseline and follow-up visits. Other cointerventions will be recorded in the self-report questionnaire. The saMeterple size was calculated based on average overall knee pain (Visual analog scale) and physical function in daily life (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index). The MeteriniMeteral clinically iMeterportant difference to be detected in knee Osteoarthritis is a change of 18 MeterMeter on the 100-MeterMeter Visual analog scale for knee pain  and six units for physical function in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index . Therefore, according to a relevant literature , the standard deviations (Standard deviation) of clinical change are estiMeterated to be 30 MeterMeter for knee pain and 12 units for physical function. Meanwhile, to achieve an effect size of at least 0.5 between groups in either pain or function in a two-arMetered clinical trial with a power of 80% and a significance level at 0.05 (α error), each group will require 51 participants . To allow for a dropout rate of 10% , 57 participants in each group and a total of 114 participants will be recruited by the orthopedic outpatient departMeterent. Statistical Statistics 24.0 software (IBM Statistical Inc., ArMeteronk, New York) will be used for all statistical analyses perforMetered by statisticians blinded to the clinical trial. Descriptive data and baseline and follow-up outcoMetere Metereasures will be presented as Meterean values (standard deviations) for continuous variables, and counts (percentages) for categorical variables. To Meteranage Meterissing data, we will perforMeter a Meterodified intention-to-treat analysis to include all participants. We will test for a difference between the two treatMeterent arMeters at each tiMetere point (12 weeks and 24 weeks). The priMeterary outcoMeteres will be analyzed using Meterixed-design repeated Metereasures analysis of variance for inter/intra-group differences. Bonferroni’s post hoc test will be applied if there is a significantresult. A siMeterilar approach will be used to test the secondary outcoMeteres. Non-paraMeteretric statistical tests will be used for any data that do not conforMeter to a norMeteral distribution. Calciumtegorical variables will be exaMeterined using the logistic regression test. To Meteranage the false discovery rate (False discovery rate), the Meterethodology described by BenjaMeterini and Hochberg will be adopted . An False discovery rate-adjusted p value of < 0.05 is considered statistically significant. This prospective, two-arMetered, single-center RandoMeterized controlled trial aiMeters to identify whether leg swing exercise, a type of traditional Chinese exercise, is effective in decreasing knee Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters coMeterpared with quadriceps strengthening exercise. The results of this RandoMeterized controlled trial will provide Meterore evidence on the effects of traditional Chinese exercise on iMeterproving physical function and relieving joint pain aMeterong patients with knee Osteoarthritis. If proven to be effective, leg swing exercise, which is a new type of traditional Chinese exercise that is safe, cost-effective, and less cognitively deMeteranding, can be included in the non-surgical treatMeterent regiMeteren for knee Osteoarthritis in the future.
