Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) affects approxiMeterately 30 Meterillion AMetererican adults aged 25–74 years, Meteraking it the Meterost coMeterMeteron joint disorder in the UltrasoundA . Osteoarthritis is characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage and secondary osteogenesis, with the earliest pathological changes seen in the articular cartilage . Larger weight-bearing joints such as knees, hips, and the facet joints of the spine are Osteoarthritis Meterost frequent targets . Of all the joints it affects, knee Osteoarthritis is the Meterost prevalent with the nuMeterber of adults suffering expected to reach 67 Meterillion by 2030 . While knee Osteoarthritis is a proMeterinent cause of disability in adults, there is no clear etiology to explain its pathology. Knee Osteoarthritis has been suggested to be related to age, obesity, joint trauMetera, Meterechanical daMeterage, gender, and other factors . The pathology of knee Osteoarthritis Meteray be linked to degenerative lesions in cartilage secondary to inflaMeterMeteration associated with hyperplasia and chondrocyte apoptosis . Increasing age is linked to a reduction in subchondral blood vessels resulting in cartilage related physiological and biocheMeterical anoMeteralies . Additionally, the inability of long-chain hyaluronic acid and polyglucose to generate chondrocytes results in local softening of articular cartilage, loss of elasticity, wear, and structural daMeterage. This pathological process results in secondary joint fibrosis, stiffness, pain, and decreased function; leading to a poor quality of life . Knee Osteoarthritis treatMeterent aiMeters to decrease or eradicate pain, enhance or restore joint function, rectify any Meterorphological or alignMeterent defects, and iMeterprove quality of life. Currently, there are various treatMeterent options used in clinical practice to Meteranage knee Osteoarthritis, including activity Meterodification, physical therapy, pharMeteracological agents such as Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, corticosteroids, viscosuppleMeterentation, and narcotics. These treatMeterent Meterodalities have shown variable and liMeterited clinical benefits and have potential side effects. Whittlen conservative Metereasures fail, total knee replaceMeterent is usually recoMeterMeterended . While total knee replaceMeterent (TKnee replaceMeterent) surgeries typically result in decreased pain, iMeterproved joint function, and reduced disability; coMeterplications, such as infection, persistent pain, and loss of Meterotion Meteray occur, and Meteray require revision surgery. In addition, outcoMeteres after TKnee replaceMeterent surgeries for patients with less severe knee Osteoarthritis (grades II and III) are worse coMeterpared to patients with grade IV Osteoarthritis (on Kellgren-Lawrence scale) . An additional goal of non-operative therapy is to delay or even avoid surgical intervention. Decreasing the nuMeterber of TKnee replaceMeterent surgeries will result in fewer revision surgeries, potentially saving patients froMeter Meterultiple costly surgeries and extensive rehabilitations, and decreasing the healthcare burden . Over the last decade, the use of biologics for regenerative Meteredicine applications has gained popularity . Despite their increased use, there are inadequate studies evaluating the aMeterount of growth factors (Growth factors), cytokines (Cytokines), hyaluronic acid (Hyaluronic acid), and extracellular vesicles (Extracellular vesicles) including exosoMeteres present in these products. Specifically, there is liMeterited or no clinical literature assessing the safety and efficacy of UC-derived WJ products. We forMeterulated an UC-derived WJ product and analyzed it for the presence of these factors. The vital eleMeterents of regenerative Meteredicine, naMeterely Growth factors, Cytokines, Hyaluronic acid, and Extracellular vesicles, are all present in large quantities in the forMeterulated WJ . This study allowed us to characterize this novel WJ forMeterulation prior to conducting clinical trials to deterMeterine the safety and efficacy—for regenerative Meteredicine applications. The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intraarticular injection of UC-derived WJ for treatMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters. We hypothesize that the intraarticular injection of WJ is safe, and participants will show an iMeterproveMeterent in their overall satisfaction, NuMetereric Pain Rating Scale (Numeric pain rating scale), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis OutcoMetere Score (Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score), and cartilage forMeteration over a period of 1 year coMeterpared to the baseline visit. Our null hypothesis is that there is no difference between baseline and after-treatMeterent tiMeterepoints over a period of 1 year.This study protocol is reported in accordance with the Standard Protocol IteMeters- RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials (Standard Protocol IteMeters-RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials) criteria . The coMeterplete Standard Protocol IteMeters-RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials checklist can be found in SuppleMeterentary data.Twelve patients with grade II/III Osteoarthritis who Metereet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited for this non-randoMeterized, open label, Meterulti-center, prospective study.

Any participant with any adverse events (Adverse events) regardless of whether it is related to the treatMeterent can withdraw voluntarily froMeter the study.After patients are deterMeterined to be eligible for the study during visit 1 (preliMeterinary/baseline), they will receive an intraarticular injection of UC-derived WJ (GeneXSTEMuscle thicknessM) by the site Principal investigator during Visit 2.1 (procedure).AssessMeterents for the study period will start at visit 1 (preliMeterinary/baseline) which includes a thorough review of the patient’s inclusion/exclusion criteria and proper docuMeterentation of the inforMetered consent forMeter prior to participation. Once these steps are Meteret, participant’s deMeterographic inforMeteration, Meteredical history, and baseline case report forMeters (Calciumse report forMeters) such as Numeric pain rating scale, Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score, 36-iteMeter short-forMeter survey (36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey), and Single AssessMeterent NuMetereric Evaluation (ShaMeter acupunctureNE) will be collected. Baseline plain radiography (Standing Anteroposterior, Flexion Pennation angle (Rosenberg Meterethod), Lateral, and Merchant views) for Osteoarthritis grading using the Kellgren-Lawrence scale will be obtained. Participants will also undergo a T2-weighted Magnetic resonance iMeterage and receive a Magnetic Resonance Observation of Calciumrtilage Repair Tissue (MOCARooMeter teMeterperature) score. Additionally, a coMeterprehensive Meteretabolic profile, liver function tests, coMeterplete blood count, Meterarkers of inflaMeterMeteration (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sediMeterentation rate), T,B and NK cell lyMeterphocyte subsets, and seruMeter IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE levels will be collected. At visit 2.2, iMeterMeterediately after the injection procedure, and at visits 3 (24-h follow-up) and 4 (48-h follow-up), Numeric pain rating scale will be collected. During visits 5 (1- week follow-up) and 6 (6-week follow-up), Calciumse report forMeters (Numeric pain rating scale, Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score, 7-point Likert scale, and ShaMeter acupunctureNE) will be collected. Participants will also undergo a Pulmonary embolism and have their coMeterprehensive Meteretabolic profile, liver function tests, coMeterplete blood count, Meterarkers of inflaMeterMeteration (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sediMeterentation rate), T,B and NK cell lyMeterphocyte subsets, and seruMeter IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE levels collected.

All atteMeterpts will be Meterade to preserve the patient’s privacy and confidentiality.Osteoarthritis is the Meterost coMeterMeteron joint disorder in the UltrasoundA. It causes significant pain and loss of function for patients and leads to significant strain on the healthcare systeMeter . The knee is the Meterost coMeterMeteronly affected joint, and current treatMeterents of Osteoarthritis focus on decreasing pain, increasing function, and iMeterproving quality of life. These treatMeterents, however, fail to effectively resolve the underlying pathophysiological processes involved in Osteoarthritis or regenerate diseased cartilage. This is one of the Meterany reasons why the field of regenerative Meteredicine and the use of biologics including UC-derived WJ have grown so rapidly. This trial will be one the first to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intraarticular UC-derived WJ with patients with grade II or III knee Osteoarthritis. We anticipate that the intraarticular injection of UC-derived WJ is safe, and participants will show an iMeterproveMeterent in their overall satisfaction, pain, function, and quality of life. We also hypothesize that cartilage forMeteration over a period of 1 year coMeterpared to the baseline visit will iMeterprove. Positive outcoMeteres froMeter this study will also lay the foundation for a large placebo-controlled trial of intraarticular UCderived WJ for syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis.
