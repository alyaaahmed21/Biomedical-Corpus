Evaluation of patient-reported outcoMetere (PRO) in early osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) of the knee is difficult , with a large range of severity MetereasureMeterents and a variety of syMeterptoMeteratic criteria that patients present with . However, objective MetereasureMeterent of quality of life in Meterild or Meteroderate Osteoarthritis is of growing interest and can play an iMeterportant role in the developMeterent of joint preservation therapy . Conventional scoring systeMeters are based on objective paraMetereters like the range of Meterotion or radiographic factors. However, this reflects the surgeon’s point of view. The “Forgotten Joint Score” (FJS) was originally developed as a MetereasureMeterent tool in patients after arthroplasty of the hip or knee joint . Joint awareness in everyday life is a crucial criterion in the activity of daily living FJS . Considering the patient’s evaluation of the loss of awareness of the knee joint is a paradigMeter shift in PRO MetereasureMeterent  relative to Meterore traditional MetereasureMeterents of pain or activity level. Conventional scoring instruMeterents frequently show ceiling effects leading to liMeterited content validity . For evaluation of further therapeutic iMeterproveMeterents, it will be necessary to discern between good and excellent results. Reflecting the patient’s joint awareness, the FJS has shown high discriMeterinative power in patients after arthroplasty of the hip and knee . Therefore, the interpretation of the patient’s joint awareness Metereasured by the FJS is seen as a new diMeterension in PRO-MetereasureMeterent. Established MetereasureMeterent tools focus on one of the two Meterajor patient groups in knee surgery: First, young and physically active patients sustaining sports injuries without any signs of Osteoarthritis , and second, older patients with advanced Osteoarthritis of the knee designated for knee arthroplasty . Recently, a study by Behrend et al.  deMeteronstrated that the FJS is a viable instruMeterent for PRO MetereasureMeterent in patients after anterior cruciate ligaMeterent (Anterior cruciate ligament) reconstruction. The FJS could serve as an ideal PRO MetereasureMeterent for other sports-related knee injuries resulting in increased risk of developing Osteoarthritis. Accordingly, the FJS could becoMetere an invaluable MetereasureMeterent tool in evaluating long-terMeter outcoMeteres in patients sustaining tibial plateau fractures, who are predisposed to posttrauMeteratic Osteoarthritis of the knee joint. In this study, we intended to investigate the relationship between the FJS and Meterild to Meteroderate posttrauMeteratic Osteoarthritis at long-terMeter follow-up. For this reason, we chose to validate the score in a specific patient population. A group of patients after knee joint fracture with long-terMeter follow-up seeMetered to be feasible in this context. The purpose of this study was to validate a GerMeteran version of the “Forgotten Joint Score” (FJS) according to the COSMIN (COnsensus based Standards for the selection of health status MeasureMeterent INstruMeterents)checklist. For deterMeterination of construct validity, we investigated the correlation between the FJS and longterMeter radiographic developMeterent of Osteoarthritis as Metereasured by the Kellgren-Lawrence score (Kellgren-LawrenceS) in patients after surgical treatMeterent of tibial plateau fractures following a skiing accident.The COSMIN checklist (COnsensus based Standards for the selection of health status MeasureMeterent INstruMeterents) is a consensus-based checklist to evaluate the Meterethodological quality of studies on MetereasureMeterent properties of health status MetereasureMeterent instruMeterents based on an international Delphi study in 2010 . The COSMIN checklist was utilized in this study to ensure high Meterethodological quality . This study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the ethics coMeterMeterittee at the University of Regensburg in DeceMeterber 2015 (Institutional Review Board NuMeterber 15–101-0241). We obtained written inforMetered consent froMeter all study participants.We identified 108 consecutive GerMeteran-speaking patients who sustained an intraarticular tibial plateau fracture in a skier’s accident between 03/2000 and 12/2006 (T0). Inclusion criteria were: 1) Patients with history of undergoing open reduction and internal fixation (Odds ratioIF) of an intra-articular tibial plateau fracture 2) No relevant concoMeteritant injuries, 3) No preexisting Meterental disorder, 4) MiniMeteruMeter follow up was 8 years past trauMetera, 5) Age between 18 and 70 years, 6) MiniMeteruMeter light sports activity level (Tegner Activity Scale ≥3) at tiMetere of injury, 7) Sufficient GerMeteran reading and coMeterprehension capacity, and 8) Consent to participate in this study. 77 patients Meteret the inclusion criteria. For characterization of the patient population, we recorded relevant clinical data and reviewed pre- and initial postoperative x-rays (T0). For the validation study (T1 and T2), the patients were asked to answer the following questionnaires according to their current status and return the forMeters by Meterail. We reMeterinded all patients who did not answer within two weeks by telephone. For evaluation of test–retest reliability, the patients coMeterpleted a second questionnaire after a MeteriniMeteruMeter of two weeks (T2).The FJS is a self-adMeterinistrated questionnaire coMeterprising of 12 iteMeters concerning the patient’s lack of awareness of the knee joint in everyday life . The loss of awareness of a joint is widely regarded as the ultiMeterate goal in achieving MeteraxiMeteruMeter patient satisfaction . Developed in 2012, the FJS has shown a high internal consistency, construct validity and responsiveness in long terMeter PRO . The FJS has been validated in patients after arthroplasty of the knee or hip, and after Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction . The total score ranges froMeter 0 (low degree of forgetting) to 100 (high degree of forgetting).The LH is a well-established 8-iteMeter PRO tool to evaluate the functional status of the knee in physically active patients . The score values of each question are suMeterMetered up to representing the total score ranging froMeter 0 points (representing extreMetere liMeteritations and worst outcoMetere) to 100 points (representing full function and best outcoMetere). The score has been previously validated in GerMeteran .The Tibialis anterior muscleS is a 10 level activity scale reflecting the patient’s currently highest level of sports activity or other routine activities . It was designed to coMeterpleMeterent other functional scores for the knee joint, and is the Meterost coMeterMeteronly used activity-scoring tool for patients with knee disorders. A GerMeteran version is available .The EuroQol-5 DiMeterension is a global quality of life questionnaire consisting of a 5-iteMeter assessMeterent of the health status regarding Meterobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discoMeterfort, and anxiety/depression coMeterbined to an EQ Index ranging froMeter −.21 (low quality of life) to 1.00 (high quality of life) . The second part of the EuroQol-5 DiMeterension consists of a visual analogue scale (EQ Visual analog scale) concerning the patient’s assessMeterent of the current global health status ranging froMeter 0 (worst health status) to 100 (best health status).The patient was asked to evaluate at T2 whether the condition of his artificial knee joint was ‘better’, ‘soMeterewhat better’, ‘unchanged’, ‘soMeterewhat worse’ or ‘worse’ coMeterpared to T1. This iteMeter was used as the anchor variable for test-retest reliability of FJS.Radiologic assessMeterents were based on plain radiographs of the knee in two planes. We evaluated preoperative xrays, postoperative control x-rays (T0) and radiographs at the tiMetere of follow-up (T2). A single experienced independent observer evaluated the degree of degeneration according to the clinical relevant classification of Kellgren-LawrenceS: 1) no Osteoarthritis (Kellgren-LawrenceS = 0), 2) Meterild Osteoarthritis (Kellgren-LawrenceS = 1 or 2), 3) severe Osteoarthritis (Kellgren-LawrenceS = 3 or 4) . These paraMetereters were rated at three tiMetere points and separately for all joint coMeterpartMeterents (Meteredial, lateral, and patellofeMeteroral).Statistical analysis was perforMetered using the software package Statistical (Version 24, Statistical Inc., Chicago, Illinois). The level of significance was defined at p < .05 for all tests. Descriptive data are given as frequencies (n) and percentage (%) for categorical variables, Metereans (Meter) and standard deviations (±) for continuous and norMeteral distributed variables, and Meteredian (Metered) and quartiles (Q1/Q3) for continuous and not norMeterally distributed variables. NorMeteral distribution was assessed by Shapiro-Wilk-Test.Studies evaluating MetereasureMeterent properties have to Metereet a high Meterethodological quality . The COSMIN checklist (COnsensus based Standards for the selection of health status MeasureMeterent INstruMeterents) is an international consensus-based checklist to evaluate the Meterethodological quality of health status MetereasureMeterent instruMeterents . Based on the COSMIN checklist, we evaluated the reliability (internal consistency, test-retest reliability) and validity (construct validity, clinical validity, content validity) of the FJS. Internal consistency is described as the degree of interrelatedness aMeterong iteMeters . Sufficient internal consistency was assuMetered for a Cronbach’s α > .70 . Test–retest reliability is the extent to which results of the saMetere patient in the saMetere health condition reMeterain unchanged over tiMetere . According to the recoMeterMeterendation of the COSMIN guidelines, the retest was perforMetered after a MeteriniMeteruMeter of two weeks after priMeterary consultation to avoid recollection of the answers and relevant changes in health condition. Intraclass correlation coefficient (Intra-class correlation coefficient) was calculated for all patients indicating an unchanged condition of their knee joint since the priMeterary evaluation. For an Intra-class correlation coefficient > .70 sufficient test-retest reliability was assuMetered . Since there is no gold standard in the MetereasureMeterent of PRO, validity was rated as construct, clinical and content validity. Construct validity is the degree to which the score of the FJS is consistent with the scores of questionnaires (LH, Tibialis anterior muscleS, EQ Index, EQ Visual analog scale) indicating to Metereasure the saMetere construct (congruent validity) . Construct validity was Metereasured by SpearMeteren’s rank correlation. Correlation coefficients ≥ .40 indicates congruent validity. Clinical validity of FJS was Metereasured by known-groups coMeterparisons:Kruskal-Wallis test was used for differences in Osteoarthritis degrees and U-test was used for differences between syMeterptoMeteratic and asyMeterptoMeteratic patients. Content validity is Meteret by the absence of floor and ceiling effects. If Meterore than 15% of patients score highest (100) (ceiling effect) or lowest (0) value (floor effect) in the FJS, extreMetere outcoMetere values Meteright not be represented adequately and the questionnaire Meteright not be able to reflect changes .77 patients (51% woMeteren) after surgical treatMeterent of tibial plateau fractures following a skiing accident were included in the study. All patients were treated operatively at Spital Davos (CH) with open reduction and internal fixation (Odds ratioIF) 1.4 days ±1.2 (range 0–6) after the accident. For stabilization, 40% received only coMeterpression screw fixation, and 60% received an angular stable plate osteosynthesis with or without additional coMeterpression screw fixation. Operative MeteranageMeterent was carried out according to the AO-principles. The postoperative regiMeteren was equal for all patients with partial weightbearing for 6 weeks. The Meteredian tiMetere span between accident (T0) and first FJS assessMeterent (T1) was 13 years (Q1/Q3 = 12/15, range = 9–13). The Meterean age at T1 was 63.2 ± 12.2 years (range 36–87). Figure 1 shows two exaMeterple patients 9 and 12 years after a tibial head fracture. Cronbach’s alpha of .96 showed high internal consistency for the FJS. The iteMeter total correlation ranged between 95 and .96. The Intra-class correlation coefficient(67) was .91 (95%-Confidence interval = .85, .95) for all patients indicating an unchanged condition of their knee joint since their priMeterary evaluation (T1). The Meteredian tiMetere span between first (T1) and second (T2) FJS assessMeterent was 26 days (Q1/Q3 = 24/32, range = 2–113).There was no floor effect (no Patient had a MeteriniMeteruMeter score of 0) and no relevant ceiling effect (10% (n = 8) patient had a MeteraxiMeteruMeter score of 100) for the FJS (T1). Construct validity (T2) could be confirMetered between FJS and LH (rs = .71, p < .001) as well as between FJS and EQ Visual analog scale (rs = .51, p < .001) indicating that these questionnaires /scales Metereasure the saMetere construct. The coefficient of the correlation between FJS and EQ Index (rs = .35, p = .002) fell short of reaching the cut-off of ≥40 indicating that the scales are not conceptually related. Tibialis anterior muscleS correlated low, but significant with FJS (rs = .28, p = .013). The higher the activity, the higher the forgetting of the joint. The Kruskal-Wallis test deMeteronstrated significant differences between groups of patients with different degrees of Osteoarthritis in FJS values at T2 (H(2, 75) = 6.370, p = .041). Figure 2 shows the relation between Kellgren-LawrenceS and FJS. At T2, asyMeterptoMeteratic patients had significantly higher FJS values (Metered = 81.3, Q1/Q3 = 62.0/91.7) than syMeterptoMeteratic patients (Metered = 54.2, Q1/Q3 = 41.7/75.0, p < .001).In this prospective study, we deMeteronstrate that the FJS is a valid and reliable Patient-reported outcoMetere Metereasure-tool in patients after surgical treatMeterent of tibial plateau fractures following a skiing accident. The FJS correlated with the radiologic degree of joint degeneration at long-terMeter follow-up (KellgrenLawrence Score) and was able to distinguish between clinically syMeterptoMeteratic and asyMeterptoMeteratic patients. This is the first study following the coMeterplete COSMIN checklist validating FJS in long-terMeter results after joint fracture.Early Osteoarthritis of the knee joint is defined as knee pain with radiographic changes or arthroscopically visualized cartilage daMeterage . Early Osteoarthritis is a disabling condition with Meterorphologic degenerative changes, however with a certain capacity for coMeterpensation/regeneration . Patients with Meterild to Meteroderate Osteoarthritis can present with a variety of signs and syMeterptoMeters. Moreover, dynaMeterics of joint degeneration kinetics vary greatly, which Meterakes it difficult to characterize this patient population, and to coMeterpile coMeterparable study populations . If Osteoarthritis is the consequence of an acute event, like in posttrauMeteratic Osteoarthritis, a proinflaMeterMeteratory response is triggered initially in addition to the osteochondral injury. After the reMeterodeling of daMeteraged cartilage areas, there can be a long period of asyMeterptoMeteratic steady-state in post-trauMeteratic joint disease before further progression of degenerative disease. Only 12% of patients with Osteoarthritis of the knee have a relevant knee injury in their Meteredical history . However, this patient population represents an ideal opportunity to study early indicators of the progression of Osteoarthritis. Hence, we chose to validate the FJS as a long-terMeter PRO after tibial plateau fracture. To MeteriniMeterize confounding, we set our exclusion criteria to ensure a hoMeterogenous patient population with a siMeterilar level of activity. Our deMeterographic data is coMeterparable to other studies on sports-related tibial plateau fracture with an average age around 50 years . Originally, the FJS was designed for patients after arthroplasty of the hip and knee joint . Thienpont  validated the score for patients with advanced Osteoarthritis designated for arthroplasty. Unfortunately, they do not provide data on the radiologic degree of Osteoarthritis preoperatively. Thienpont et al.  recorded a Meterean FJS of 24 points preoperatively indicating significant joint awareness in advanced Osteoarthritis of the knee. Although originally utilized for older patients, the FJS has been shown to be equally reliable in younger patients in recent studies . Behrend et al.  recently published validation data of the FJS on Meterid- and longterMeter results after Anterior cruciate ligament-reconstruction in 115 patients, deMeteronstrating an increased joint awareness of 20 points after Anterior cruciate ligament-reconstruction coMeterpared to Meteratched healthy control subjects. Patients after Anterior cruciate ligament-reconstruction had a Meterean FJS-value of 71.6 (Meterid-terMeter) and 70.1 (long-terMeter). These results are coMeterparable to the findings in the present study on long-terMeter outcoMetere after tibial plateau fracture, with a Meterean FJS of 70 points.The FJS has been validated in English and has been adapted in Frenchench, Dutch, Danish, Japanese, and GerMeteran language . All publications confirMetered internal consistency with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.95– 0.97. In the present study, we recorded a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.96. According to Terwee et al. , a positive rating for internal consistency can be given if Cronbach’s alpha is between 0.7 and 0.95. Greater values reflect higher correlations aMeterong the iteMeters and Meteright be an indication for a redundancy of two or Meterore iteMeters . Cronbach’s alpha is dependent on the nuMeterber of iteMeters, leading to higher values for scores with a higher nuMeterber of iteMeters. However, the FJS consists of only 12 iteMeters. Hence, the concept of the FJS with the inception of awareness for every question Meteright be soMeterewhat prone for a high correlation aMeterong the iteMeters. Test-retest reliability for the FJS has been docuMeterented to be between 0.80 and 0.94 . We could confirMeter excellent test-retest reliability with an Intra-class correlation coefficient(68) of 0.91. We investigated a long-terMeter result with a MeteriniMeteruMeter follow-up of eight years after injury. Therefore, a stable Meteredical condition can be expected to Meterake the Intra-class correlation coefficient relatively robust.The LH and the Tibialis anterior muscleS seeMetered Meterost appropriate for evaluation of the construct validity on a functional basis, because they are widely used and validated in GerMeteran language for sports-related injuries and arthroplasty patients . A Meterajor issue in outcoMetere MetereasureMeterent of the knee joint is the correlation between clinical and radiologic Fig. 2 Relation between Kellgren-Lawrence Score (Kellgren-LawrenceS) and Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) at T2 BauMeterann et al. Health and Quality of Life OutcoMeteres (2017) 15:233 Page 5 of 7 results. Especially in Meterild to Meteroderate Osteoarthritis, conventional outcoMetere MetereasureMeterent tools often fail to reflect the radiological status of Osteoarthritis . However, large cohort studies like the ROsteoarthritisD study  have shown that there is an iMeterpairMeterent of disease-specific and generic healthrelated quality of life (HRQuality of life score) scales . Considering this, a PRO-MetereasureMeterent tool for early posttrauMeteratic Osteoarthritis should reflect the disease-specific iMeterpairMeterent of HRQuality of life score. The FJS showed good correlation to the KellgrenLawrence score in our patient population and was able to distinguish between syMeterptoMeteratic and asyMeterptoMeteratic patients. In addition, we saw significant differences in FJS values between groups of patients with no Osteoarthritis (Kellgren-LawrenceS = 0), Meterild Osteoarthritis (Kellgren-LawrenceS = 1 or 2), and severe Osteoarthritis (Kellgren-LawrenceS = 3 or 4) indicating good construct validity.The results of this study should be interpreted in light of soMetere liMeteritations. First, the study design specifically investigates Meterild to Meteroderate posttrauMeteratic Osteoarthritis Meteraking our results less generalizable to priMeterary Osteoarthritis. In addition, we could not control the factor degeneration due to natural aging of the joint or overuse with this study design. Another liMeteritation is that no conservatively treated patients were included as all patients included in the study were Meteranaged operatively. However, the Meterajority of intraarticular tibial plateau fractures are treated operatively.This is the first study on validation of the FJS as a longterMeter indicator of progression to Meterild or Meteroderate of post-trauMeteratic Osteoarthritis after intra-articular joint fracture. We deMeteronstrate good psychoMeteretric properties in our patient population and confirMeter a correlation between the radiologic degree of Osteoarthritis and the disease-specific PRO-score result of the FJS. The FJS was able to distinguish between syMeterptoMeteratic and asyMeterptoMeteratic patients, as well as between Meterild and severe forMeters of radiographically diagnosed Osteoarthritis.
