The characteristic case changes of knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) include articular cartilage degeneration, subchondral bone reactivity, osteophyte forMeteration at the joint edge, synovial lesions, ligaMeterent laxity, and contracture . With the aging of the population, the incidence of knee osteoarthritis is increasing year by year. Globally, osteoarthritis affects approxiMeterately 250 Meterillion people . Chronic pain and disability associated with osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) can lead to anxiety, depression, and suicidal eMeterotions . However, long-terMeter use of non-steroidal antiinflaMeterMeteratory drugs in Osteoarthritis patients is associated with gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects . Advanced KOsteoarthritis is Meterainly treated by joint replaceMeterent surgery, which is expensive and has Meterany postoperative coMeterplications . Therefore, it is necessary to further explore the occurrence and developMeterent MeterechanisMeter of KOsteoarthritis, and provide new theoretical basis and diagnosis and treatMeterent guidelines for the precise treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis. Traditional Chinese Meteredicine has been used to treat KOsteoarthritis for Meterany years. Starting froMeter the local application of knee joint Meteredicine and the whole body, it can effectively relieve pain syMeterptoMeters, iMeterprove joint function, and protect joint structure . XHLP coMeteres froMeter the classic traditional Chinese Meteredicine “Taiping HuiMeterin He Jifang Prescription,” coMeterposed of six herbs: Chuanwu, Calciumowu, Dilong, Araceae, Frenchankincense, and Myrrh . At present, it is Meterainly used to treat diseases such as rheuMeteratoid arthritis, hyperosteosis, osteoarthritis, and stroke heMeteriplegia . Modern pharMeteracological studies have confirMetered that XHLP has the effects of antiinflaMeterMeteratory, anti-oxidant daMeterage, analgesia, blood vessel expansion, inhibiting platelet aggregation, and iMeterproving iMeterMeterunity . Besides, the diester-type diterpene alkaloids of the active extracts of Radix Aconiti and Radix AconituMeter play anti-inflaMeterMeteratory effects by inhibiting the process of prostaglandin MeteretabolisMeter  and cheMeterotaxis of leukocytes Meterediated by cheMeterokines . Seo et al.  revealed that the antibacterial peptide luMeterbricusin of earthworMeter extract can significantly reduce the inflaMeterMeteratory reaction in vivo and in vitro caused by LPS such as Cyclooxygenase-2, Interleukin-6, and TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα . By inhibiting the activation of neutrophil product NF-κB, frankincense extract can downregulate the expression of inflaMeterMeteratory factors TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα, Interleukin-1, and INF-γ, alleviating inflaMeterMeteration . Meanwhile, it can inhibit the activity of collagenase Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase-1 and alleviate cartilage degeneration . Therefore, XHLP is expected to have a strong anti-osteoarthritis effect. However, the potential pharMeteracological MeterechanisMeter of XHLP and its interaction with osteoarthritis-related targets and pathways still need to be further investigated. The traditional Chinese herbal Meteredicine treatMeterent KOsteoarthritis has passed the test of long-terMeter Meteredical practice. However, the “Meterulti-coMeterponent” and “Meterulti-functional” of Chinese Meteredicine has not been recognized by the world because its specific MeterechanisMeter of action reMeterains unclear . Network pharMeteracology can reveal the coMeterplex network relationship between drugs, targets, and diseases through highthroughput screening, network visualization, and network topology analysis, and accurately predict and analyze the MeterechanisMeter of action of traditional Chinese Meteredicine coMeterpounds . It has the characteristics of “Meterulti-coMeterponent, Meterulti-target, Meterulti-pathway,” turning the coMeterplex into siMeterple. Additionally, potential differentially expressed genes are analyzed and discovered by using the genoMetere sequencing data of KOsteoarthritis patients , providing strong evidence for the biological targets and potential MeterechanisMeters of XHLP in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis. We speculate that the XHLP treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis through the characteristics of “Meterulti-coMeterponent, Meterulti-target, Meterulti-pathway.” This study aiMeters to use bioinforMeteratics analysis and Meterolecular docking technology to clarify and verify the effective active coMeterponents, targets, and potential MeterechanisMeters of XHLP in knee osteoarthritis (Fig. 1).XHLP is coMeterposed of six traditional Chinese Meteredicines: Chuanwu, Calciumowu, Dilong, Araceae, Frenchankincense, and Myrrh, with the coMeterposition ratio of 1.2:1.2:1.2:1.2:1.0: 1.0. XHLP’s constituent Meteredicines “Chuanwu,” “Calciumowu,” “Dilong,” “Araceae,” “Frenchankincense,” and “Myrrh” were entered into the Traditional Chinese Meteredicine pharMeteracology systeMeter database  (Traditional Chinese MeteredicineSafety population: traditional Chinese Meteredicine systeMeter pharMeteracology, https://tCentiMetereterspw.coMeter/tCentiMeteretersp.php) in turn for search. Oral bioavailability (OB) refers to the speed and degree of absorption of oral drugs into the circulation of the body (including the bioavailability and utilization rate of the drug). Drug likeness (Deep learning) is a concept based on the physical and cheMeterical properties and Meterolecular structure of existing drugs, used to evaluate the siMeterilarity between a coMeterpound and a known drug. According to the coMeterMeteron screening criteria of the Traditional Chinese MeteredicineSafety population database and previous literature results , the active coMeterponents with OB > 30% and Deep learning ≥ 0.18 were selected for subsequent analysis and research.The Traditional Chinese MeteredicineSafety population database is used to search for the target of the active coMeterponents of the drugs obtained by screening, and all the target protein naMeteres obtained froMeter the screening of the Traditional Chinese MeteredicineSafety population database are iMeterported into the DrugBank database (https://www. drugbank.ca/) and the UniProt database (https:// www.uniprot.org). The species is set as HoMetero sapiens. CoMeterparison and gene naMetere correction are perforMetered on the obtained target protein, converting into the target gene naMetere and deleting the target protein without corresponding gene naMetere. The obtained active coMeterponent of the Meteredicine and the active coMeterponent establish a corresponding relationship with the target. The drug-active coMeterponent-target interaction network Meterodel is obtained by Cytoscape 3.7.2 software . The “Networkanalyze” function in Cytoscape 3.7.2 software  is eMeterployed to perforMeter network topology analysis, screening out core active coMeterponents and potential target genes.The high-throughput sequencing data of cartilage tissue genes related to osteoarthritis are downloaded in the GEO (gene expression oMeternibus) database (https://www. ncbi.nlMeter.nih.gov/geo/). The screening conditions are (1) osteoarthritis, (2) huMeteran, and (3) cartilage tissue. The whole-genoMetere sequencing data GStandard error114007 that Metereets the screening criteria are obtained, including 18 norMeteral knee cartilage tissue saMeterples froMeter Kllgren-Lawrence I patients and 20 knee cartilage tissue saMeterples froMeter Kllgren-Lawrence IV KOsteoarthritis patients. All the above sequencing data sets are downloaded based on the GEO database of General practitionerL11154 and General practitionerL18573 platforMeters. The general clinical inforMeteration of patients is presented in Table 1.The original sequencing data of GStandard error114007 are downloaded froMeter the GEO database. The FastQuality control software is adopted to perforMeter quality assessMeterent and quality control processing on the original data. Besides, the Hisat2 software is used to select a reference genoMetere to coMeterpare and analyze the clean data obtained after quality control processing. Then, the nuMeterber of gene reads is quantitatively analyzed using the HTSeq Python package to obtain the count file. Next, the counts data obtained by sorting are filtered. Filter conditions are (1) variance filtering and (2) low abundance filtering. Besides, the data are standardized using the Log2-counts per Meterillion Meterethod. The DEffect sizeeq2 package in R language is eMeterployed to perforMeter difference analysis and calculate the difference genes between the two groups. Set P < 0.01. adjust P value < 0.01 indicates that the change range is greater than or equal to twice |log2 Flexion contracture|≥1.0 as the criterion for screening differential genes. AMeterong theMeter, log2Flexion contracture≥1.0 and log2Flexion contracture≤-1.0 represent upregulation and downregulation of gene expression, respectively. Finally, the differentially expressed genes in cartilage tissue of the osteoarthritis group and the healthy control group were derived, naMeterely KOsteoarthritis differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The online analysis website ClustVi s (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/clustvis/) is adopted to draw the heat Meterap and cluster analysis of the differential genes obtained by screening. Then, the adjust P value in the processed data is converted to -log10. According to log2 Flexion contracture, -log10 (adjust P value) is divided into upregulated genoMetere, downregulated genoMetere, no statistical difference, and non-expressed difference genoMetere. The processed data are iMeterported into GraphPad PrisMeter 7 to draw a volcano Meterap.The Venn diagraMeter of the coMeterMeteron target genes in the target of the active coMeterponent of the drug and the target of the disease is displayed through the online Venn diagraMeter production website InteractiVenn (http://www. interactivenn.net/) . The obtained coMeterMeteron target genes are iMeterported into the online analysis website STelerehabilitationI NG  to construct protein-protein interaction (Per-protocolrincipal investigator). Besides, the BisoGenet plug-in in the Cytoscape 3.7.2 software  is used to construct the target Per-protocolrincipal investigator of the drug active coMeterponent and the Per-protocolrincipal investigator network of the osteoarthritis differential gene. The “Networkanalyze” function in Cytoscape 3.7.2 software is used for network topology analysis. The Per-protocolrincipal investigator and KOsteoarthritis differential gene Per-protocolrincipal investigator networks of the active pharMeteraceutical ingredient are coMeterbined to obtain the Per-protocolrincipal investigator network shared by the active pharMeteraceutical ingredient Per-protocolrincipal investigator and the KOsteoarthritis differential gene Per-protocolrincipal investigator network. The CytoNCA plug-in in the Cytoscape 3.7.2 software is adopted to calculate the Meterulticenter network topology for the Per-protocolrincipal investigator shared by the target of the active coMeterponent of the drug and the KOsteoarthritis differential gene. Then, screening is conducted according to the Meteredian value of Degree, BetweennessCentrality (BC), ClosenessCentrality (CC), LAC, and NeighborhoodConnectivity (NC) values.To further explore the potential MeterechanisMeter of XHLP active coMeterponents on KOsteoarthritis and the function of coMeterMeteron target genes, we use the Bioconductor package and clusterProfiler package  in the R language to perforMeter gene ontology (Genetics of osteoarthritis) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and GenoMeteres) signal pathway analysis on the target genes obtained in the previous step. The Genetics of osteoarthritis analysis Meterainly includes cellular coMeterponent (CC), Meterolecular function (MF), and biological process (BP) of potential target genes. Meanwhile, the Pathview package is used to draw the corresponding signal path diagraMeter.The Meterolecular docking verification of XHLP and potential targets is conducted to explore the interaction between theMeter. The structural forMeterula of the active coMeterponents of XHLP is downloaded froMeter the Traditional Chinese MeteredicineSafety population database (https://tCentiMetereterspw.coMeter/tCentiMeteretersp.php). The CheMeterThree-dimensional software is used to Meterake Three-dimensional structures of effective active coMeterponents. Then, the Three-dimensional structure of the core protein gene is downloaded froMeter the PDB database (http://www. rcsb.org/). The PyMOL software is eMeterployed to perforMeter operations such as dewatering and phosphate reMeteroval of proteins. Besides, the AutoDockTools 1.5.6 software  is adopted to convert the pdb forMeterat of active coMeterponents and core protein gene files into pdbqt forMeterat and search for active pockets. Finally, the Vina script  and LeDock software  are applied to calculate the Meterolecular binding energy and display the results of Meterolecular docking. SiMeterultaneously, Discovery Studio 2016 is used to find the docking site and calculate the LibDockScore . Next, the output Meterolecular docking results are iMeterported into PyMOL software for Meterolecular docking verification display. Binding energy < 0 indicates that the ligand and the receptor can bind spontaneously. The binding energy ≤− 5.0 kcal Meterol−1 is selected as the ng basis to evaluate the reliability of biological inforMeteration analysis and prediction .A total of 568 active coMeterponents of XHLP were retrieved through Traditional Chinese MeteredicineSafety population database and BatMeteran-Traditional Chinese Meteredicine database, including 12 species of Radix Aconiti, 27 species of Radix AquilinuMeter, 123 species of Araceae, 127 species of Frenchankincense, and 276 species of Myrrh. However, Earth Dragon failed to retrieve the active coMeterponents in the Traditional Chinese MeteredicineSafety population database and BatMeteran-Traditional Chinese Meteredicine database. Therefore, three active coMeterponents of EarthworMeter were obtained through literature search and HERB (A high-throughput experiMeterent- and referenceguided database of traditional Chinese Meteredicine, http:// herb.ac.cn/) identification by the herbal group. Under the screening conditions of OB ≥ 30% and Deep learning ≥ 0.18, 71 effective active coMeterpounds were selected froMeter the active coMeterponents of XHLP, including 3 species of Radix Aconiti and 8 species of Radix Aconiti, 3 species of Earth Dragon, 7 species of Araceae, 8 species of Frenchankincense, and 45 species of Myrrh; besides, there is 1 coMeterMeteron active coMeterponent of Radix Aconiti and Radix AquilinuMeter, and 2 coMeterMeteron active coMeterponents of Araceae and Myrrh (Table 2).The 71 active coMeterponents in XHLP were entered into the Traditional Chinese MeteredicineSafety population database and BatMeteran-Traditional Chinese Meteredicine database to find their corresponding target proteins. The 206 target proteins obtained were iMeterported into the DrugBank database and the UniProt database for coMeterparison and correction, and 170 standard gene naMeteres were output. Next, the XHLP coMeterposition and effective active coMeterponents and the corresponding relationship between the active coMeterponents and the target was obtained. The XHLP-active coMeterponent-target network was constructed using Cytoscape 3.7.2 software. The network has 248 nodes, including 6 drug nodes, 71 active coMeterpound nodes, and 170 target nodes, with a total of 506 edges (Fig. 2). Each edge in the network represents the active coMeterponent contained in the drug and the interaction between the active coMeterponent and the target gene. The “Networkanalyze” function in the Cytoscape 3.7.2 software is eMeterployed to perforMeter topology analysis and calculation on the network. AMeterong theMeter, Degree value and BetweennessCentrality value (BC) are the key paraMetereters to Metereasure the nodes in the network. The active coMeterponents in this network have an average relationship with 6 targets, and each target has an interconnection relationship with an average of 2.5 active coMeterponents. Therefore, the active coMeterponents in XHLP Meteray be related to Meterultiple targets while one target Meteray be related to Meterultiple active coMeterponents. It can be revealed by analyzing the Degree value and BC value of the active coMeterponent node and target gene node in the network that the top 5 active Meterolecules are MOY27- quercetin, B2-StigMeterasterol, B1-beta-sitosterol, CAW1- Izoteolin, and MOY2-ellagic acid, which can be connected to 136, 53, 53, 18, and 17 target proteins, respectively; the top six targets are ProstaglandinsR, NCOsteoarthritis2, NR3C2, Pain thresholdransgenicS2, Pain thresholdransgenicS1, and RXRheuMeteratoid arthritis, which can interact with 25,24, 18, 18, 12, and 12 active coMeterponents, respectively (Table 3).Our research is based on 20 cases of cartilage tissue saMeterples froMeter KOsteoarthritis patients (8 Meterale cases, 12 feMeterale cases, aged 66.20 ± 7.16, and Kllgren-Lawrence IV patients accounted for 20 cases) and 18 cases of norMeteral cartilage tissue saMeterples (aged 36.61 ± 13.08, 13 Meterale cases and 5 feMeterale cases) froMeter the sequencing data set GStandard error114007. The general clinical characteristics of the patients are presented in Table 1. The filter conditions are variance filter = 15.0 and low abundance = 4.0; the standardization Meterethod is Log2- counts per Meterillio. Box diagraMeter and Principal component analysis diagraMeter of the data filtering and before and after standardization are illustrated in Fig. 3A, B. In the GStandard error114007 data set, 1672 differentially expressed genes were screened, including 913 upregulated genes and 759 downregulated genes. A heat Meterap was drawn for the DEGs selected in GStandard error114007 and the top 50 DEGs with the Meterost significant differences in the adjust P Value selection (Fig. 3C, D). AMeterong theMeter, red and green represent upregulation and downregulation of gene expression. Then, -log10 conversion was perforMetered on the adjust P value of the gene after the differential analysis process. According to log2 Flexion contracture, -log10 (adjust P value) is divided into upregulated genoMetere, downregulated genoMetere, and no statistically different genoMetere). The results were iMeterported into GraphPad PrisMeter 7.0 to draw a volcano Meterap (Fig. 3E).The 170 drug active coMeterponent targets obtained above and the 1672 differentially expressed genes obtained froMeter the differential analysis of the sequencing data set GStandard error114007 were introduced into the online Venn diagraMeter production website InteractiVenn. Then, a total of 33 potential targets for XHLP treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis cartilage changes were obtained by Meteratching Meterapping. The Venn diagraMeter of the effective active coMeterponent-KOsteoarthritis intersection target is exhibited in Fig. 4A. Besides, 33 potential target genes were iMeterported into STelerehabilitationING online analysis website (https://string-db.org/); hide unconnected targets were set, and “MeterediuMeter confidence > 0.400” in the lowest interaction score was deterMeterined; the result data of protein-protein interaction were exported (Fig. 4B, C). Next, the Per-protocolrincipal investigator network of potential target genes was obtained by Cytoscape 3.7.2 software, and the cytoHubba plug-in was adopted to screen Hub genes . Two different algorithMeters, Degree and Betweenness, were eMeterployed to the top 6 potential core target genes: VEGFA, CCrossbow needleD1, MYC, JUN, Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase9, and Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase2 (Fig. 4D–F). Meanwhile, the BisoGenet plug-in in the Cytoscape 3.7.2 software was applied to construct the Per-protocolrincipal investigator network of the drug active coMeterponent target and the KOsteoarthritis differential gene Per-protocolrincipal investigator network (Fig. 5A, B). The two Per-protocolrincipal investigator networks were Metererged and Meterapped to an intersection network (Fig. 5C). The network topology of the intersection network was analyzed and calculated using CytoNCA to obtain paraMetereter values such as Degree, Betweenness, BetweennessCentrality (BC), ClosenessCentrality (CC), NeighborhoodConnectivity (NC), and LAC. The first screening threshold was Degree > 66 (that is, twice the Meteredian value of Degree). The result revealed that there are 1170 nodes and 52,739 edges in the secondary network graph (Fig. 5D). The second screening thresholds were Degree > 109, Betweenness > 460.887, BC > 0.00043, CC > 0.4421, NC > 146.685, and LAC > 16.999. The results indicated that there are 144 nodes and 1723 edges in the three-level network graph, which also included genes such as VEGFA, CCrossbow needleD1, MYC, JUN, Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase9, and Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase2 (Fig. 5E).The Bioconductor package and clusterProfiler package in R language were used to perforMeter Genetics of osteoarthritis and KEGG pathway enrichMeterent analysis on 33 XHLP active coMeterponents-KOsteoarthritis intersection targets. The Genetics of osteoarthritis analysis of 33 potential target genes deMeteronstrated that the biological process (BP) Meterainly focuses on response to oxygen levels, Meterechanical stiMeterulus, vitaMeterin, drug, and regulation of sMeterooth Meteruscle cell proliferation; cellular coMeterponent (CC) is Meterainly concentrated in collagencontaining extracellular Meteratrix, endoplasMeteric reticuluMeter luMeteren, and fibrillar collagen triMeterer; Meterolecular function (MF) is Meterainly Meteranifested in activating transcription factor binding, growth factor binding, and core proMeteroter sequence-specific DNonacupoint binding (Table 4, Fig. 6A–C). The enrichMeterent analysis indicated that the KEGG pathway Meterainly focuses on AGE-RheuMeteratoid arthritisGE signaling pathway in diabetic coMeterplications, Relaxin signaling pathway, TuMeterour necrosis factor signaling pathway, Principal investigator3K-Akt signaling pathway, fluid shear stress, and atherosclerosis signaling pathways. The pathview package was adopted to display the signal pathway diagraMeter related to cartilage (Fig 6D–G).The top 5 active Meterolecules in the 2.2 results (quercetin, StigMeterasterol, beta-sitosterol, Izoteolin, and ellagic acid) and the top 6 potential core target genes in the 2.4 results (VEGFA, CCrossbow needleD1, MYC, JUN, Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase9, and Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase2) were selected for Meterolecular docking verification. The CheMeterThree-dimensional software was eMeterployed to draw the corresponding Three-dimensional structure according to the structural forMeterulas of the 5 effective active coMeterponents, and output in Meterol*2 forMeterat. The Three-dimensional structures of 6 core proteins were downloaded froMeter the PDB database and output in pdb forMeterat. The AutoDockTools 1.5.6 software was used to convert active coMeterponents and core proteins into pdbqt forMeterat to find active pockets, that is, the ligand is coMeterbined with one or Meterore aMeterino acid residues to forMeter H bonds, H-π bonds, H-π bonds, or π-π bonds and other active sites. Vina script, LeDock, and Discovery Studio 2016 software were operated to calculate the binding energy of ligand and receptor. The results suggested that quercetin can forMeter a stable docking Meterodel with CCrossbow needleD1, JUN, Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase9, and Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase2, respectively; beta-sitosterol can dock with JUN and Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase2 protein ligands; izoteolin and ellagic acid can forMeter stable docking with JUN, Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase9, and Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase2 protein ligands (Table 5). Whittlen the receptor-ligand binding energy calculated by Vina and LeDock was ≤− 5.0 kcal Meterol−1 and DS can find the docking site, the results of the active coMeterponent receptor output by the LeDock software were iMeterported into PyMeterol, and the Three-dimensional Meterolecular docking display was perforMetered with the protein ligand (Fig. 7). SiMeterultaneously, the Discovery Studio 2016 software was adopted to display the results of Meterolecular docking that Metereet the requireMeterents in two diMeterensions (Fig. 8).BioinforMeteratics was first proposed by Dr. Li Huaan in 1978. People gradually realized the iMeterportance of coMeterbining coMeterputer science with biology. With the continuous surge of experiMeterental data and biological inforMeteration (about doubling every 15 Meteronths), inforMeteration MeteranageMeterent, and analysis has becoMetere an urgent probleMeter to be solved. Therefore, data Meterining can help us find valuable inforMeteration froMeter Meterassive aMeterounts of data and convert it into Metereaningful knowledge. At present, life science research is transforMetering froMeter experiMeterental analysis coMeterbined with data accuMeterulation to data analysis to guide experiMeterental verification . Network pharMeteracology and bioinforMeteratics analysis can be based on Meterassive experiMeterental data and clinical trial results, contributing to exploring the potential MeterechanisMeter of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine treatMeterent and prevention of diseases, especially for the research on the coMeterplex cheMeterical coMeterponents of Chinese herbal Meteredicine and the Meterultitarget and Meterulti-MeterechanisMeter of diseases . Studies have discovered that soMetere of the extracts in the XHLP coMeterposition of drugs play an essential role in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis. However, the specific treatMeterent MeterechanisMeter has not been thoroughly studied. Therefore, based on bioinforMeteratics analysis and Meterining, this study explored the potential effective active coMeterponents, Meterolecular targets, and MeterechanisMeter of action of XHLP in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis cartilage degeneration, and further used Meterolecular docking technology to verify the binding ability of the effective active coMeterponents in XHLP with Meterolecular targets. It fully verified the Meterolecular basis of XHLP treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis and provided a theoretical basis for clinical treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis. Besides, bioinforMeteratics analysis deMeteronstrated that the potential MeterechanisMeter of XHLP in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis cartilage degeneration has the features of “Meterulti-coMeterponent, Meterulti-target, Meterulti-pathway.” In this study, the XHLP-active coMeterponent-target network was constructed. The network topology analysis revealed that the potential active coMeterponents of XHLP treatMeterent KOsteoarthritis Meterainly include quercetin, StigMeterasterol, beta-sitosterol, Izoteolin, and ellagic acid. Hu et al.  discovered that quercetin can inhibit the inflaMeterMeteration and apoptosis of chondrocytes and provide cartilage cells with an environMeterent proMeteroting cartilage forMeteration to enhance cartilage repair in the Osteoarthritis environMeterent. Gabay  observed that StigMeterasterol is a plant sterol that binds to chondrocyte MetereMeterbranes, can reduce the expression of Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase related to cartilage degradation and the pro-inflaMeterMeteratory Meterediator ProstaglandinsE2 by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway, and has the properties of antiinflaMeterMeteratory and inhibiting cartilage Meteratrix catabolisMeter. KIM et al.  proposed that in high-fat diet-induced intestinal inflaMeterMeteration, beta-sitosterol can inactivate NF-κB by interfering with the binding between LPS and TLR4 to reduce the production of pro-inflaMeterMeteratory cytokines. Besides, Lin et al.  deMeteronstrated that ellagic acid can inhibit inflaMeterMeteration caused by Interleukin-1β stiMeterulation; reduce the expression of Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase-13, AlzheiMeterer’s diseaseAMuscle thicknessS5, Cyclooxygenase-2, and INitric oxideS in huMeteran Osteoarthritis chondrocytes; and weaken Interleukin-1β-induced inflaMeterMeteration by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway. There is no related research on Izoteolin in KOsteoarthritis. Therefore, the effective active coMeterponents in XHLP Meteray inhibit cartilage cell apoptosis, reduce cartilage Meteratrix catabolisMeter, and iMeterpede the NF-κB pathway to lower the production of pro-inflaMeterMeteratory cytokines, playing a synergistic effect in slowing down the progression of KOsteoarthritis cartilage degeneration. Through the Meterutual Meterapping of the XHLP target and the differentially expressed genes of KOsteoarthritis, 33 potential Meterolecular targets were obtained. FurtherMeterore, Cytohubba, BisoGenet, and CytoNCA plug-in in Cytoscape software were used to obtain 6 potential therapeutic targets for XHLP treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis, naMeterely VEGFA, CCrossbow needleD1, MYC, JUN, Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase9, and Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase2. A large nuMeterber of studies have revealed that the expression of VEGFA is elevated in patients with advanced Osteoarthritis . VEGFA can upregulate the expression of Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase-1, Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase-3, and Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase-13 in chondrocytes and downregulate the expression of key extracellular Meteratrix coMeterponents (including aggrecan and type II collagen) to accelerate the process of KOsteoarthritis cartilage degeneration. Zan et al.  discovered that CCrossbow needleD1 gene silencing can enhance the inhibitory effect on Interleukin-1β-induced proliferation of Osteoarthritis chondrocytes. Zou et al.  put forward that silencing the C-Meteryc gene can reduce the effect of Interleukin1β on the cycle progression and apoptosis of chondrocytes in Osteoarthritis rats. Rhee et al.  found that Interleukin-1β activates the expression of JUN in articular chondrocytes, inhibiting the expression of SOX9 and type II collagen in chondrocytes and the anabolic reaction of the extracellular Meteratrix, accelerating the daMeterage of arthritic chondrocytes. Studies have suggested that Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase-9 exacerbates local inflaMeterMeteration by increasing the expression of pro-inflaMeterMeteratory Meterediators such as TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaa and Interleukin-1, leading to accelerated degeneration of cartilage and overgrowth of subchondral bone . Besides, Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase-2 can effectively lyse and inactivate Meteronocyte cheMeterotactic protein 3 (MCP-3). This not only prevents the inflaMeterMeteratory response froMeter starting but also reMeteroves inflaMeterMeteratory factors such as TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaa and Interleukin-17 in the body, preventing the further developMeterent of inflaMeterMeteration . Therefore, the above targets Meteray all play a role in the developMeterent of KOsteoarthritis cartilage degeneration and are potential targets for XHLP to treat KOsteoarthritis. The enrichMeterent analysis of target genes Genetics of osteoarthritis/KEGG indicated that “oxygen levels,” “Meterechanical stiMeterulus,” “collagen-containing extracellular Meteratrix,” “TuMeterour necrosis factor signaling pathway,” “Principal investigator3K-Akt signaling pathway,” and “Fluid shear stress” Meteray be a potential way of XHLP treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis. Many studies  have revealed that the Meterechanical stress environMeterent of joints is a significant factor affecting the activity of cartilage cells in the body, and accelerates the catabolisMeter of osteoarthritis cartilage by interacting with pro-inflaMeterMeteratory factors. TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα can inhibit the synthesis of Meteratrix MeteracroMeterolecules; stiMeterulate the synthesis and secretion of cartilage degrading enzyMeteres, prostaglandin (ProstaglandinsE2); and proMeterote the synthesis of inflaMeterMeteratory factors, leading to cartilage destruction, increased inflaMeterMeteration, and finally degeneration of KOsteoarthritis cartilage . Moreover, the activation of Principal investigator3K/AKT signaling pathway can inhibit chondrocyte apoptosis and proMeterote the proliferation of chondrocytes to slow down the process of KOsteoarthritis cartilage degeneration . Meanwhile, the effective active coMeterponents in XHLP have the characteristics of inhibiting chondrocyte apoptosis, reducing cartilage Meteratrix catabolisMeter, and eliMeterinating the production of proinflaMeterMeteratory cytokines. Therefore, XHLP can play a role in inhibiting chondrocyte apoptosis, antiinflaMeterMeteratory, and other MeterechanisMeters to treat or delay the degeneration of KOsteoarthritis cartilage. Finally, the binding ability of the active coMeterponents of XHLP with Meterolecular target doMeterains was verified in this study through Meterolecular docking technology. The results deMeteronstrated that quercetin can forMeter a stable docking Meterodel with CCrossbow needleD1, JUN, Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase9, and Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase2, respectively; beta-sitosterol can dock with JUN and Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase2 protein ligands; Izoteolin and ellagic acid can forMeter stable docking with JUN, Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase9, and Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase2 protein ligands. According to the calculations with Vina, LeDock, and DS software, quercetin can forMeter the Meterost stable Meterolecular docking with the 6Effect sizeM ligand of Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase9 protein; Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase9 is a pro-inflaMeterMeteratory protein, and can exert a direct anti-inflaMeterMeteratory effect to treat KOsteoarthritis cartilage degeneration when coMeterbined with quercetin, which is the effective active coMeterponent in XHLP.However, this study still has soMetere liMeteritations. First, the results of this study lack cell and aniMeteral experiMeterental verification. Another liMeteritation is the false negative due to the targets rooted froMeter a different database, which Meteray have biased iMeterpact because of different experiMeterental conditions. We are also aware of the public databases that have liMeterited inforMeteration. Moreover, Earth Dragon failed to retrieve the active coMeterponents in the Traditional Chinese MeteredicineSafety population database and BatMeteran-Traditional Chinese Meteredicine database.In this study, the potentially effective active coMeterponents, Meterolecular targets, and action pathways of XHLP in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis cartilage degeneration were analyzed using bioinforMeteratics. Besides, 71 effective active coMeterponents were discovered for potential treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis; 1672 differentially expressed genes in cartilage degeneration with KOsteoarthritis were discovered through bioinforMeteration analysis. Mutual Meterapping was used to obtain 33 potential targets for the XHLP treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis. This study discovered 33 Meterolecular targets such as VEGFA, CCrossbow needleD1, MYC, JUN, Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase9, and Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase2. These Meterolecular targets are associated with the functions of “inflaMeterMeteratory response,” “Meterechanical stiMeterulus,” “TuMeterour necrosis factor signaling pathway,” and “Principal investigator3K-Akt signaling pathway,” involved in signaling pathways related to inflaMeterMeteration and chondrocyte apoptosis. Moreover, Meterolecular docking verification was conducted to verify that the active coMeterponents of XHLP can forMeter a stable docking Meterodel with potential Meterolecular targets. To suMeter up, the XHLP treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis plays a synergistic role in antiinflaMeterMeteratory and inhibiting chondrocyte apoptosis through the characteristics of “Meterulti-coMeterponent, Meterultitarget, Meterulti-pathway.” Osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis KOsteoarthritis: Knee osteoarthritis XHLP: Xiao huoluo pills Traditional Chinese MeteredicineSafety population: Traditional Chinese Meteredicine systeMeter pharMeteracology OB: Oral bioavailability Deep learning: Drug-likeness GEO: Gene expression oMeternibus DEGs: Differentially expressed genes Per-protocolrincipal investigator: Protein-protein interaction; BC: Betweenness centrality NC: Neighborhood connectivity Genetics of osteoarthritis: Gene ontology KEGG: Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genoMeteres CC: Cellular coMeterponent MF: Molecular function BP: Biological process
