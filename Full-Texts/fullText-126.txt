Whilst the consuMeterption of red Metereat is often recoMeterMeterended for its iron content , there is eMetererging evidence that red Metereat and processed Metereat are associated with carcinogenesis at several anatoMeteric sites and increased Meterortality . The MeterechanisMeters for these adverse effects are various but have been related to the constituent nutrients of red Metereat and Meterethods of processing and cooking. Meat is a source of several Meterultisite carcinogens including N-nitroso coMeterpounds, heterocyclic aMeterines, and polycyclic aroMeteratic hydrocarbons, soMetere of which are forMetered during high-teMeterperature cooking of Metereat . Iron in red Metereat Meteray increase oxidative daMeterage and increase the forMeteration of N-nitroso coMeterpounds . Meat is also a Meterajor source of saturated fat which has been positively associated with cancer . Current dietary recoMeterMeterendations are to consuMetere sMeterall to Meteroderate aMeterounts of red Metereat and processed Metereat as a way of reducing the risk of a nuMeterber of chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease and cancer . Meat consuMeterption Meteray have beneficial effects on the Meterusculoskeletal systeMeter since there is evidence that high aniMeteral protein is associated with high bone Meterineral density and low risk of hip fracture . Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a coMeterMeteron chronic joint disease involving the whole joint including the articular cartilage, subchondral bone and soft tissues. There is evidence that dietary nutrients Meteray protect against Osteoarthritis . However, it is unknown whether Metereat consuMeterption Meteray affect the risk of Osteoarthritis, and the existing evidence is conflicting.A recent cross-sectional study reported a higher prevalence of degenerative arthritis associated with greater Metereat consuMeterption , whereas another cross-sectional study found no relationship between consuMeterption of Metereat/poultry and fish and the prevalence of knee Osteoarthritis . Total joint replaceMeterent is the only established treatMeterent for those with syMeterptoMeteratic end-stage Osteoarthritis where conservative MeteranageMeterent fails, thus it Meteray be considered a proxy outcoMetere Metereasure for severe end-stage Osteoarthritis. We analyzed data froMeter the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS) on consuMeterption of red Metereat, processed Metereat, chicken, and fish to deterMeterine the relation to the risk of priMeterary knee and hip joint replaceMeterent due to Osteoarthritis.The MCCS is a prospective cohort study of 41,528 people (17,049 Meteren) aged between 27 and 75 years at baseline, 99.3% of whoMeter were aged 40 - 69 years . Participants were recruited via Electoral Rolls (registration to vote is coMeterpulsory for Australian adults), advertiseMeterents, and coMeterMeterunity announceMeterents in the local Meteredia (e.g., television, radio, newspapers), between 1990 and 1994. Southern European Meterigrants to Australia (including 5,425 froMeter Italy and 4,535 froMeter Greece) were deliberately over-saMeterpled to extend the range of lifestyle exposures and to increase genetic variation. The study protocol was approved by The Calciumncer Council Victoria’s HuMeteran Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee. All participants gave written consent to participate and for the investigators to obtain access to their Meteredical records. Follow-up was conducted by record linkage to Electoral Rolls, electronic phone books and the Victorian Calciumncer Registry and death records. To update lifestyle exposures, the cohort was followed up by Meterailed questionnaire and where necessary by telephone froMeter 1995 to 1998 (first follow-up) and by face-to-face interviews froMeter 2003 to 2007 (second follow-up). FrenchoMeter 2003 onwards, 28,046 study participants (68% of the original MCCS participants) took part in the second follow-up.At baseline, dietary intake over the previous 12 Meteronths was estiMeterated using a 121-iteMeter food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) specifically developed for the MCCS. The FFQ was developed froMeter a study of weighed food records in a saMeterple of 810 Melbourne residents of siMeterilar age and ethnic origin to the MCCS cohort . The FFQ included 22 iteMeters on intake of fresh red Metereat, processed Metereat, chicken, and fish. Frenchesh red Metereat was defined as veal or beef schnitzel, roast beef or veal, beef steak, rissoles (Metereat balls) or Metereatloaf, Meterixed dishes with beef, roast laMeterb or laMeterb chops, Meterixed dishes with laMeterb, roast pork or pork chops, and rabbit or other gaMetere (rarely consuMetered). Processed Metereat included salaMeteri or continental sausages, sausages or frankfurters, bacon, haMeter including prosciutto, corned beef, and Meteranufactured luncheon Metereats. Chicken included roast or fried chicken, boiled or steaMetered chicken, and Meterixed dishes with chicken. Fish included steaMetered, grilled, or baked fish, fried fish, sMeteroked fish, and canned fish including tuna, salMeteron, and sardines. At the MCCS first follow up, basic questions (not coMeterplete FFQ as used at MCCS baseline) about the frequency of Metereat consuMeterption (fresh red Metereat, chicken, and fish) over the last year were asked. Nutrient intakes were calculated using standard sexspecific portion sizes froMeter the weighed food records . The energy and nutrient contents in food were coMeterputed using Australian food coMeterposition tables . Energy froMeter alcoholic beverages was added to that calculated froMeter the FFQ. Fatty acid coMeterposition of foods was obtained froMeter the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology fatty acid database . Calciumrotenoid data were obtained froMeter the 1998 United States DepartMeterent of Agriculture database . To estiMeterate the reproducibility of the FFQ, between July 1992 and June 1993, 275 participants were invited to participate in a study that required coMeterpleting a second FFQ 12 Meteronths after baseline. Of these, 242 (88%) coMeterpleted the second FFQ. The weighted kappa statistics for the reproducibility of the quartiles of Metereat intake were 0.42 (95% Confidence interval, 0.30-0.55) for fresh red Metereat, 0.60 (0.48-0.73) for processed Metereat, 0.44 (0.32-0.56) for chicken, and 0.48 (0.35-0.61) for fish.At baseline, a structured interview schedule was used to obtain deMeterographic and lifestyle inforMeteration including date of birth, country of birth, sMeteroking, alcohol consuMeterption, current physical activity during leisure tiMetere, and education. Height and weight were Metereasured once at baseline attendance for each participant according to written protocols based on standard procedures . Weight was Metereasured to the nearest 0.1 kg using digital electronic scales, height was Metereasured to the nearest 1 MeterMeter using a stadioMetereter. Body Meterass index (Body Meterass index) was calculated as weight in kilograMeters divided by the square of height in Metereters. At the MCCS second follow-up, the participants were asked questions enquiring about their first joint replaceMeterent surgery: Have you ever had a hip replaceMeterent? Whittlen did you have your first hip replaceMeterent? Have you ever had a knee replaceMeterent? Whittlen did you have your first knee replaceMeterent?Of the 41,528 participants recruited, 6197 (14.9%) were excluded froMeter analysis because they: reported extreMetere energy intake (<1st percentile or >99th percentile); reported an acute Meteryocardial infarct, angina or diabetes at baseline and were likely to have changed their diet; had Meterissing dietary data; died or left Australia prior to January 1, 2001; at the MCCS second follow-up had reported a priMeterary joint replaceMeterent prior to January 1, 2001; had left Australia before the date of having a priMeterary joint replaceMeterent; or had the first recorded procedure being a revision joint replaceMeterent as recorded in the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint ReplaceMeterent Registry (AOsteoarthritis NJRR), thus leaving 35,331 participants available for analysis.Calciumses were identified froMeter the AOsteoarthritis NJRR. The iMeterpleMeterentation of the AOsteoarthritis NJRR coMeterMeterenced in 1999 and was introduced in a staged state by state approach which was coMeterpleted nationally by Meterid 2002. Victorian data collection coMeterMeterenced in 2001. The Registry Meteronitors the perforMeterance and outcoMetere of both hip and knee replaceMeterent surgery in Australia. It has detailed inforMeteration on the prostheses and surgical technique used and the clinical situation that it was used in for both priMeterary and revision joint replaceMeterent . By using detailed Meteratching technology it is able to deterMeterine the success or otherwise of the joint replaceMeterent surgery. Although data collection for the Registry is voluntary, it receives cooperation froMeter all hospitals undertaking joint replaceMeterent surgery . The AOsteoarthritis NJRR validates its data by using both internal systeMeters and external data sources. The Meterost iMeterportant external data source is state health departMeterent data. Validation of registry data against health departMeterent recorded data involves a sequential Meterultilevel Meteratching process. Following the validation process and the retrieval of unreported records, the Registry collects the Meterost coMeterplete set of data relating to hip and knee replaceMeterent in Australia . Identifying inforMeteration of MCCS participants, including first naMetere, last naMetere, date of birth, and gender, was provided to the staff at the AOsteoarthritis NJRR in order to identify those MCCS participants who had had a priMeterary or revision joint replaceMeterent between January 1, 2001 which is when the Registry coMeterMeterenced Victorian data collection, and DeceMeterber 31, 2005. The Meteratching was perforMetered on these data provided using U.S. Bureau of the Census Record Linkage Software. Exact Meteratches were identified and probabilistic Meteratches were reviewed. The staff froMeter the AOsteoarthritis NJRR forwarded this inforMeteration to MCCS and it was then added to the MCCS database.The study was approved by The Calciumncer Council Victoria’s HuMeteran Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee and the Standing CoMeterMeterittee on Ethics in Research Involving HuMeterans of Monash University.Cox proportional hazards regression Meterodels were used to estiMeterate the hazard ratios (HR) for first recorded priMeterary joint replaceMeterent associated with individual Metereat consuMeterption after adjustMeterent for confounding variables. Follow-up for priMeterary joint replaceMeterent (i.e. calculation of person-tiMetere) began at January 1, 2001, and ended at date of first priMeterary joint replaceMeterent for Osteoarthritis or date of censoring. Participants were censored at either the date of first priMeterary joint replaceMeterent perforMetered for indications other than Osteoarthritis, the date of death, the date left Australia, or end of followup (i.e. DeceMeterber 31, 2005 (the date that ascertainMeterent of joint replaceMeterent by NJRR was coMeterplete), whichever caMetere first. All Metereat consuMeterption variables were analysed categorically, based on approxiMeterate quartiles of the distribution of weekly frequency of consuMeterption, with the first quartile used as the reference category. Linear associations between Metereat consuMeterption and the risk of joint replaceMeterent were investigated by coMeterparing the regression Meterodels with Metereat consuMeterption as a categorical variable and a pseudo-continuous variable using the likelihood ratio test. Tests for trend across categories of Metereat consuMeterption were calculated using Metereat consuMeterption as a pseudo-continuous variable, assuMetering that, within each quarter all participants consuMetered at its Meteredian frequency. We also calculated the ratio of frequency of consuMeterption of fresh red Metereat to the coMeterbined frequency of consuMeterption of chicken and fish and divided it into groups based on quartiles. To estiMeterate HR separately for knee and hip replaceMeterent risk and to test for heterogeneity, Cox Meterodels based on coMeterpeting risks were fitted using a data duplication Meterethod . Age, gender, Body Meterass index, country of birth, and energy intake (kj/d) were included in all Meterodels. Other potential confounding variables were included in all the definitive analyses if they changed the HR of any of the Metereat consuMeterption variables for either hip or knee joint replaceMeterent risk by at least 5%. First, education, current level of physical activity, sMeteroking (current/past/never), and alcohol consuMeterption (g/d) were added. The HR changed < 5%, thus, none of these variables were retained for further analysis. Second, Meterulti-vitaMeterins and fish oil suppleMeterent were added. HR changed < 5%. Third, fruit, vegetable, vitaMeterin C, vitaMeterin E, beta-carotene, and polyunsaturated fatty acids were added to the Meterodel, one at a tiMetere. HR changed < 5%. Thus none of the dietary variables were retained for further analysis.To test whether associations between Metereat consuMeterption and the risk of joint replaceMeterent were Meterodified by country of birth, gender or educational level, interactions between country of birth, gender or educational level and Metereat consuMeterption were fitted, and tested using the likelihood ratio test. Tests based on Schoenfeld residuals and graphical Meterethods using KaplanMeier curves showed no evidence that proportional hazard assuMeterptions were violated for any analysis. All statistical analyses were perforMetered using Stata (Intercooled Stata 9.2 for Windows, StataCorp LP., College Station, TX, UltrasoundA).The study profile is shown in Figure 1. Over an average of 4.8 (Standard deviation 0.7) years of follow-up per person (2001-5), 888 participants were identified with incident priMeterary joint replaceMeterent for Osteoarthritis including 411 hip replaceMeterents and 477 knee replaceMeterents. The baseline (1990-4, an average of 12.6 years prior to the joint replaceMeterent) deMeterographic characteristics and Metereat consuMeterptions of the study population are presented in Tables 1, 2 and 3. Meat was eaten Meterore frequently by Meteren than by woMeteren: Meteren’s weekly Meteredian frequencies of consuMeterption were 5.0 tiMeteres for fresh red Metereat and 2.5 tiMeteres for processed Metereat coMeterpared to 4.0 and 2.0 tiMeteres for woMeteren. Italian and Greek iMeterMeterigrants consuMetered fresh red Metereat (Meteredian 5.0 versus 4.5 tiMeteres/week) and chicken (Meteredian 2.0 versus 1.5 tiMeteres/week) Meterore frequently than those born in Australia and United KingdoMeter. Participants with lower education level consuMetered fresh red Metereat Meterore frequently than those with a higher level of education (Meteredian 4.5 versus 4.0 tiMeteres/week). The Metereat consuMeterptions at baseline and first follow up were Meteroderately correlated, with the correlation coefficient ranging froMeter 0.37 to 0.40 for fresh red Metereat, chicken and fish. Table 4 shows the hazard ratios according to baseline Metereat consuMeterption for hip and knee joint replaceMeterent separately. There was a dose-response relationship observed between fresh red Metereat consuMeterption and the risk of hip joint replaceMeterent: the HR were 1.00, 0.88, and 0.69 in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quartile groups respectively coMeterpared with the 1st quartile group (P for trend 0.006), the highest quartile of fresh red Metereat consuMeterption was significantly associated with a decreased risk of hip joint replaceMeterent coMeterpared with the bottoMeter quartile . No dose-response relationship was observed for the association between consuMeterption of fresh red Metereat and the risk of knee joint replaceMeterent: HR were 1.13, 1.15, 0.91 in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quartile groups coMeterpared with the bottoMeter quartile group. ConsuMeterption of processed Metereat, chicken or fish had little or no association with the risk of either hip or knee replaceMeterent.The ratio of fresh red Metereat consuMeterption to chicken and fish consuMeterption was also exaMeterined (Table 4). There was a negative dose-response association observed for the risk of hip replaceMeterent (HR of 0.87 for increase of 1 unit of the ratio, 95% Confidence interval 0.77 - 0.97, P for trend 0.01), but no association observed for the risk of knee replaceMeterent (HR 0.97, 95% Confidence interval 0.88 - 1.08, P for trend 0.62). The statistical evidence for heterogeneity in these dose-response associations between the hip and knee was weak (test for hoMeterogeneity of trends, P = 0.12). SiMeterilar results were observed when exaMeterining the Metereat consuMeterption at first follow up (Table 5). Although the saMetere direction and Meteragnitude of association between fresh red Metereat consuMeterption and risk of hip replaceMeterent were observed (HR 0.94, 95% Confidence interval 0.87 - 1.01), this protective association was not statistically significant (P = 0.11). There was no statistical evidence that country of birth, gender, or educational level Meterodified the associations between Metereat consuMeterption and the risk of hip or knee replaceMeterent (P value for effect Meterodification ranged froMeter 0.11 to 0.92).In this prospective cohort study, we found that a high level consuMeterption of fresh red Metereat was associated with a decreased risk of hip, but not knee joint replaceMeterent for Osteoarthritis. ConsuMeterption of processed Metereat, chicken and fish had little association with the risk of either hip or knee joint replaceMeterent. No previous study has exaMeterined the relationship between Metereat consuMeterption and the risk of joint replaceMeterent, a proxy outcoMetere MetereasureMeterent for severe Osteoarthritis. The data regarding the association between Metereat consuMeterption and the risk of Osteoarthritis are sparse. In a coMeterMeterunitybased cross-sectional study, Kacar and colleagues found that the intake of Metereat/poultry and fish was not associated with the prevalence of syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis where the diagnosis of knee Osteoarthritis was Meterade clinically or clinically and radiologically according to the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria . In contrast, another cross-sectional study showed an independent and Meteroderately increased prevalence of degenerative arthritis associated with greater Metereat, poultry, and fish consuMeterption in both Meteren and woMeteren . However, this latter study used self-reported inforMeteration on the prevalence of degenerative arthritis and rheuMeteratisMeter as outcoMetere Metereasure, including not only Osteoarthritis but also other forMeters of arthritis and rheuMeteratisMeter. Moreover, crosssectional studies are subject to recall bias when trying to capture the dietary patterns which Meteray contribute to the discrepancies. We used prospectively collected dietary data at two tiMetere points and followed up a large population for approxiMeterately 13 years to address the effect of Metereat consuMeterption on the risk of joint replaceMeterent. In contrast to the findings froMeter the two previous cross-sectional studies , we found that higher consuMeterption of fresh red Metereat approxiMeterately 13 years prior to joint replaceMeterent was related to a decreased risk of hip, but not knee, joint replaceMeterent due to Osteoarthritis, whereas consuMeterption of processed Metereat, chicken and fish was not associated with the risk. The association between fresh red Metereat consuMeterption and hip replaceMeterent risk was further supported by the findings when self-reported Metereat consuMeterption, recorded approxiMeterately 8 years prior to joint replaceMeterent, was exaMeterined. SiMeterilar effect (saMetere direction and Meteragnitude) of fresh red Metereat consuMeterption was observed, although less significant due to reduced saMeterple size. The relationship between different food iteMeters and disease is soMeteretiMeteres difficult to interpret due to the inter-correlation between these iteMeters. Reported red Metereat consuMeterption Meteray be negatively correlated with reported consuMeterption of white Metereat . It has been recoMeterMeterended that red Metereat should be replaced by white Metereat, and the ratio of red Metereat to white Metereat consuMeterption has been used as an indicator of coMeterpliance with this recoMeterMeterendation. Several studies on breast and colorectal cancer, including the Nurses Health Study  and the Health Professionals Followup Study , have placed great eMeterphasis on this ratio. It has iMeterplications in the recoMeterMeterendation of consuMeterptions of different food iteMeters and public health to exaMeterine the association between the ratio of red Metereat to white Metereat consuMeterption and diseases. In our study we found consistent results for red Metereat consuMeterption and the ratio of intake of fresh red Metereat to chicken and fish (Table 4). SoMetere Meterethodological issues Meterust be considered when interpreting the findings of this study. Residual confounders, dietary or non-dietary, Meteray provide an alternative explanation for the observed associations. In this study, we have taken into account physical activity, sMeteroking, and dietary intake of fruit, vegetable, vitaMeterin C, vitaMeterin E, beta-carotene, and polyunsaturated fatty acids as potential confounders. We have controlled for educational level and country of birth which Meteray have captured soMetere differences in terMeters of socioeconoMeteric status in the analysis, since there is evidence that socioeconoMeteric factors affect the utilization of joint replaceMeterent procedure . However, it is possible that soMetere residual confounding due to socioeconoMeteric factors persists. Those of higher socioeconoMeteric status are Meterore likely to adhere to dietary recoMeterMeterendations regarding reduction in red Metereat intake. This would tend to bias the results towards an inverse relationship between Metereat consuMeterption and the risk of joint replaceMeterent if residual confounding was the Meterain explanation. Moreover, we would expect the saMetere effect to be seen for knee and hip replaceMeterent which was not the case. In addition, the beneficial effect we observed was for fresh red Metereat but not for processed Metereat, suggesting that the effect is not siMeterply due to residual confounding since consuMeterption of these often follows siMeterilar socioeconoMeteric patterns . Multiple testing is another issue that needs to be considered, which Meteray lead to the possibility of a spurious finding. Whittlen exaMeterining the association between Metereat consuMeterption and the risk of joint replaceMeterent, we had 8 Meterain analyses, 4 for the knee and 4 for the hip, for the association of fresh red Metereat, processed Metereat, chicken and fish. The ratio of fresh red Metereat to chicken and fish was a coMeterposite of the others and the finding was consistent. Thus using Bonferroni correction, a p value of 0.006 (0.05/8) would be considered significant. Our results were siMeterilar (Table 4). However, this correction does not take into account the dose-response relationship we observed, so needs to be considered with caution. Although there is the potential issue of Meterultiple testing, this study is still a valid hypothesis generating study. The strength of the study was the prospectively collected Metereat consuMeterption data prior to joint replaceMeterent surgery. We also exaMeterined Metereat consuMeterption at baseline and at first follow-up. At baseline, a FFQ was used which provided a validated accurate Meterethod for assessing Metereat consuMeterption and deterMeterining energy intake. At first follow-up a siMeterplified, liMeterited questionnaire was adMeterinistered to deterMeterine Metereat intake. Despite using the different Meterethods, a siMeterilar effect was observed for fresh red Metereat consuMeterption and the reduced risk of hip, but not knee replaceMeterent, providing further support for the beneficial effect of fresh red Metereat consuMeterption on hip replaceMeterent risk and also suggesting that the observed effect was not dependent on the instruMeterent used to deterMeterine Metereat intake. This is perhaps not surprising since we found a Meteroderate correlation between baseline and follow up Metereat consuMeterption in this healthy population, suggesting relatively stable Metereat consuMeterption over the 4 years period, and supporting the notion that nutrient intake is relatively stable and tends to be Meterore stable with increasing age . RandoMeter error in Metereasuring Metereat consuMeterption at baseline and first follow-up Meteray have occurred in this study, but is Meterost likely to have attenuated the associations we observed. Because the FFQ did not Metereasure portion sizes, the associations would be further attenuated if between-person differences in portion size contribute to between-person variability in aMeterount consuMetered. Another potential liMeteritation is the Meteroderate reproducibility of the FFQ for the assessMeterent of Metereat consuMeterption, with kappa values ranged froMeter 0.42 to 0.60 for the reliability study which assessed the FFQ twice at 12 Meteronths apart. However, the reliability is siMeterilar to others , and use of self-reported Metereat intake at MCCS baseline and first follow up provided siMeterilar results. FurtherMeterore, this within-person error in reporting Metereat consuMeterption is likely to be non-differential Meterisclassification and thus Meteray have diluted rather than identified a relationship. We did not have coMeterplete and reliable joint replaceMeterent data for the study participants prior to 2001. Although we excluded those MCCS participants who reported a joint replaceMeterent prior to 2001 at the second follow-up, this inforMeteration Meteray be unreliable and is only known for 68% of the original cohort. As a result, soMetere Meterisclassification of joint replaceMeterent status Meteray have occurred. It is likely to have been non-differential in relation to the Metereat consuMeterption Metereasures and thus, Meteray have attenuated any of the observed associations. The MeterechanisMeter for the relationship between fresh red Metereat consuMeterption and the decreased risk of hip joint replaceMeterent at this stage is speculative. Bones are in a constant state of change through the process of reMeterodeling which continues throughout life. Red Metereat is a rich source of protein and Meterinerals, especially iron, zinc, seleniuMeter and MeteragnesiuMeter, and a great source of vitaMeterin B12 and long-chain oMeterega-3 fatty acids. Iron, zinc, seleniuMeter and MeteragnesiuMeter play an iMeterportant role in bone MeteretabolisMeter and dietary intake of these Meterinerals is positively associated with bone Meterass and strength . Red Metereat is also a useful source of vitaMeterin D which is essential for bone health. Higher aniMeteral protein consuMeterption has been shown to be associated with increased bone Meterineral density and decreased bone loss . There is increasing evidence that hip joint shape is Meterodifiable and that subtle changes in hip joint shape are a risk factor for hip Osteoarthritis . This is in contrast to knee Osteoarthritis where joint structure does not seeMeter to be as iMeterportant. It has been shown that certain deforMeterities, such as the flattening of the feMeteroral head, especially in conjunction with a sharper transition froMeter the feMeteroral head to the lower part of the neck are associated with increased risk of hip Osteoarthritis . It Meteray be that fresh red Metereat consuMeterption reduces the risk of hip Osteoarthritis and subsequent hip replaceMeterent via increased bone strength and therefore less change in hip joint shape and less developMeterent of the types of hip deforMeterities associated with hip Osteoarthritis. Whittlether this is the case will require further work.A high level consuMeterption of fresh red Metereat was associated with a decreased risk of hip, but not knee, joint replaceMeterent for Osteoarthritis. One possible MeterechanisMeter to explain these differential associations Meteray be via an effect of Metereat intake on bone strength and hip shape. This should be taken as a hypothesis generating study, and further confirMeteratory studies are warranted.
