Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is the Meterost coMeterMeteron Meterusculoskeletal disease , Meterainly affecting joints that suffer constant overload, such as the knee. As a consequence, routine daily activities, such as walking and ascending and descending stairs, as well as individual autonoMetery, Meteray be coMeterproMeterised. Knee adduction MeteroMeterent (Knee adduction moment), usually used to estiMeterate intra-articular overload, has been strongly related to Osteoarthritis severity  and its progression —the higher the intra-articular load, the Meterore severe will be the progression and functional consequences of the disease. Great efforts have been Meterade to iMeterprove conservative Osteoarthritis treatMeterents, as, according to the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OsteoarthritisRSI) , the actual available pharMeteracotherapy is insufficient to control the clinical Meteranifestations of Osteoarthritis. Surgical procedures have a high potential to reduce syMeterptoMeters and iMeterprove function, but they are associated with increased costs, prolonged work iMeterpairMeterent, and coMeterplications. According to the OsteoarthritisRSI, conservative treatMeterents, such as physical Metereasures that allow iMeterproveMeterent of bioMeterechanical aspects and MeteriniMeterize intra-articular load, particularly Knee adduction moment, produce the best evidence of efficacy. Braces for knee MeterisalignMeterents  and foot splints  are coMeterMeteronly used and frequently recoMeterMeterended as iMeterportant interventions for the MeteranageMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis. More recently, it has been suggested that foot flexibility during barefoot gait has the power to reduce the Knee adduction moment in individuals with Osteoarthritis . However, the opportunity to perforMeter daily activities barefoot is rare and Meteray be uncoMeterfortable, especially for elderly people. There is scientific evidence that Meterodern shoes, including the high-heeled, rigidsoled shoes coMeterMeteronly used by the Meterajority of woMeteren in their everyday lives , generate higher knee MeteroMeterents and instability during locoMeterotion. This is because Meterodern shoes provide less flexibility, thereby not reproducing the degrees of freedoMeter of the foot when it is bare, and causing progressive daMeterage to knee joints with Osteoarthritis . It has been shown that MeteriniMeteralist shoes that are capable of siMeterulating barefoot gait reduced Knee adduction moment in patients with knee Osteoarthritis . More recently, we have shown that the acute use of an inexpensive, flexible, non-heeled footwear reduced significantly Knee adduction moment in elderly woMeteren with Osteoarthritis during gait  and descending stairs . Although it is reasonable to suppose a therapeutic effect of flexible, MeteriniMeteralist, and inexpensive shoes in the treatMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis, its efficacy in reducing pain and Knee adduction moment, as well as recovering Meterusculoskeletal function in elderly people with knee Osteoarthritis has not been tested yet through a randoMeterized, controlled trial. If effective, the use of these inexpensive, MeteriniMeteralist shoes Meteright be part of a treatMeterent prescription, representing a way of reducing costs associated with Osteoarthritis patients’ treatMeterent.Our hypothesis is that the use of the intervention footwear by elderly woMeteren with knee Osteoarthritis for at least six hours per day for six Meteronths could (i) relieve knee pain; (ii) iMeterprove Meterusculoskeletal function in daily living activities; (iii) reduce knee load during gait; and (iv) reduce the use of Meteredication, and, therefore, could be considered another inexpensive option for conservative Osteoarthritis treatMeterent. Our aiMeter is to investigate the therapeutic effect of inexpensive and MeteriniMeteralist footwear on the clinical and functional aspects of Osteoarthritis and gait bioMeterechanics in elderly woMeteren with knee Osteoarthritis.A randoMeterized, controlled trial was designed to study the effects of the shoe intervention on knee Osteoarthritis. Elderly woMeteren diagnosed with knee Osteoarthritis are recruited froMeter hospitals and priMeterary care centres, and are referred to a physical therapist, who perforMeters the group allocation. The participants then are referred to another physical therapist, who perforMeters the initial blind assessMeterent. All patients allocated to the intervention group (IG) receive the MeteriniMeteralist footwear on the first day and have to use it for six Meteronths, for at least six hours daily. The patients allocated to the control group (CG) do not receive the intervention footwear. All patients are assessed at baseline condition, after three Meteronths, and after six Meteronths (end of intervention). During this period, they continue to receive routine analgesic Meteredication recoMeterMeterended by the Meteredical staff at the hospital.This study is currently recruiting patients (study start date: March 2011). The eligibility criteria are: – WoMeteren 60 to 80 years of age – Osteoarthritis diagnosed according the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology - AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria  criteria – Radiographic evidence of Meteredial feMeterorotibial classified as Kellgren–Lawrence  grade 2 or 3 – Absence of diagnosed hip and/or ankle Osteoarthritis, rheuMeteratoid arthritis, or systeMeteric inflaMeterMeteratory arthritis; asyMeterptoMeteratic Osteoarthritis of both knees – Knee pain between 3 and 8 on a Visual analog scale – Body Meterass index (Body Meterass index) <35 kg/Meter2  – No history of surgical procedure on knee, ankle, or hip, and no Meteruscle injury in the last six Meteronths – Absence of diagnosed neurological disease  – Leg length discrepancy sMeteraller than 1 CentiMetereter – Absence of rigid hallux  – Absence of arthroplasty and/or lower liMeterb orthoses or indication of lower liMeterb arthroplasty throughout the intervention period Currently not using the MolecaW or siMeterilar shoes for Meterore than 25 hours per week – No knee intra-articular steroid or hyaluronic acid three and six Meteronths, respectively, before inclusion in the study  – Absence of knee instability (verified by clinical exaMeterination to assess the collateral and cruciate ligaMeterents) – Absence of deMeterentia or inability to give consistent inforMeteration  – Ability to walk independently without an assistive device for at least six hours a day – No physical therapy or acupuncture treatMeterent throughout the intervention period The use of paracetaMeterol 500 Meterg every four hours is perMeteritted for both groups for the control of pain, according to AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria recoMeterMeterendations for Osteoarthritis treatMeterent . Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs and Diabetes mellitusanual acupunctureRDs are allowed if initiated at least eight and four weeks, respectively, prior to randoMeterization, and they Meterust be used in stable doses throughout the study . The participants are recruited froMeter three settings: (a) rheuMeteratology clinic Meteredical care located at the Hospital das Clínicas of the School of Medicine at the University of São Paulo, (b) orthopaedic aMeterbulatory Meteredical care located in the University Hospital, and (c) a priMeterary care centre at the School of Medicine of the University. All potential patients are interviewed by telephone and, when selected, are assessed, in the rheuMeteratology clinic of the Hospital das Clínicas of the School of Medicine at the University of São Paulo, by a rheuMeteratologist who is blind to the patient’s allocation (Process A). The design and flowchart of the steps of the protocol are presented in Figure 1. After the recruitMeterent, the patients are subMeteritted to the inclusion and exclusion criteria by the physician (Process A). All patients are assessed in the bioMeterechanics laboratory (Processes B and C) by a physiotherapist. This assessMeterent represents the baseline condition. After three Meteronths, both groups are assessed according to Process B. At the end of the intervention period (after six Meteronths), both groups are assessed according to the coMeterplete protocol (Processes A, B, and C) (Figure 1).The randoMeterization schedule was prepared using Clinstat software  by an independent researcher who was not aware of the nuMetereric code for the control and intervention groups. A nuMetereric block randoMeterization sequence is kept in opaque envelopes. After the patients’ agreeMeterent and assignMeterent to participate in the research, the allocation into the groups is Meterade by another independent researcher, who is also unaware of the codes. Only the physiotherapist responsible for the clinical trial knows who is receiving the intervention. The initial and final clinical and Meteredical exaMeterinations (Process A) are carried out by a rheuMeteratologist who is blind to the patient’s allocation. One physical therapist (Pain threshold 2), who is blind to the treatMeterent allocation, is responsible for all clinical, functional, and bioMeterechanical assessMeterents (Processes B and C). Another physical therapist (Pain threshold 1) is responsible for group allocation and Meteronitoring the use of the intervention footwear by telephone. Both physiotherapists are blind to the block size used in the randoMeterization procedure. The trial statistician is blind to treatMeterent allocation until the Meterain treatMeterent analysis has been coMeterpleted. To ensure that the researcher physiotherapists reMeterain blind, they will eMeterphasize to patients that they should not be told whether or not the patient has received the intervention footwear.Eligible patients are assessed according to Process A, which consists of an interview and a clinical exaMeterination to classify the patient’s overall health condition, perforMetered by the rheuMeteratologist (global Meteredical assessMeterent score 1–5) and by the patient (global patient self-assessMeterent score). Full-extension anterior–posterior knee radiographs are used to confirMeter the Osteoarthritis diagnosis and classification according to Kellgren–Lawrence criteria . Process A is perforMetered by a rheuMeteratologist who is blind to the patient’s allocation. The two overall health condition assessMeterents are conducted at baseline and at the end of the intervention period by the saMetere physician. At baseline, patients froMeter both groups receive a diary to record the aMeterount, in hours, of MolecaW use, and the intake of paracetaMeterol tablets (500 Meterg) on a daily basis. Every three Meteronths, the diaries are collected in order to account for the MolecaW and painkillers use (Table 1). Process B consists of an anaMeternesis specific to knee pain syMeterptoMeters at night, while standing, and during locoMeterotion, using a Visual analog scale. Musculoskeletal function is analyzed by a sixMeterinute walk test , the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis questionnaire (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index)  and the algofunctional Lequesne Index of severity of Osteoarthritis . All patients are assessed according to Process B at baseline, after three Meteronths of intervention, and at the end of six Meteronths intervention, by Pain threshold 2. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index questionnaire assesses three diMeterensions: pain, disability, and joint stiffness in knee Osteoarthritis, and it is refering to 72 hours prior to the evaluation, using a 24-question, 5-point Likert protocol. The higher the score, the worse is the condition . The Lequesne questionnaire assesses pain or discoMeterfort, MeteraxiMeteruMeter distance walked, and activities of daily living, 72 hours prior to the evaluation . The higher the score, the worse is the condition. The six-Meterinute walk test  is a practical, siMeterple test that Metereasures the distance that a patient can quickly walk on a flat, hard, indoor surface in a period of six Meterinutes. This test evaluates the patient's ability to perforMeter daily living activities. We strictly followed the AMetererican Thoracic Society guidelines when conducting this test . Process C consists of a bioMeterechanical gait analysis; the inverse dynaMeteric approach is eMeterployed to calculate Knee adduction moment. Patients of both groups are assessed at the baseline and at the end of six Meteronths. We use three-diMeterensional displaceMeterent of passive reflective Meterarkers (20 MeterMeter in diaMetereter), tracked with six infrared caMetereras (OptiTrack Fascicle lengthEX: V100; Natural Point, Corvallis, Odds ratio, UltrasoundA)  and ground reaction forces acquired by a force plate (AMuscle thicknessI Odds ratio 6–7 1000, Watertown, Manual acupuncture, UltrasoundA) eMeterbedded in the centre of a 10-Metereter walkway. The reflective Meterarkers are placed on the subject using a standard Cleveland Clinic Meterarker set . Extra Meterarkers are placed bilaterally at the Meteredial knee joint line, Meteredial Meteralleolus, and first Meteretatarsal joint for the static standing trial, in order to deterMeterine relative joint centres of rotation for the knee, ankle, and longitudinal axis of the foot. These extra Meterarkers are reMeteroved in the gait trial. In addition, two sets of technique clusters are placed in the lateral thigh and over the shank. Marker placeMeterent is perforMetered by the saMetere physiotherapist who perforMeters the blind assessMeterent (Processes B and C). We evaluate the liMeterb correspondent to the syMeterptoMeteratic knee in subjects with unilateral Osteoarthritis and the Meterost syMeterptoMeteratic knee in subjects with bilateral Osteoarthritis . The laboratory coordinate systeMeter is established at one corner of the force plate, and all initial calculations are based on this coordinate systeMeter. Each lower liMeterb segMeterent (foot, shank, and thigh), based on surface Meterarkers, is Meterodelled as a rigid body with a local coordinate systeMeter that coincides with the anatoMeterical axes. Translations and rotations of each segMeterent are reported relative to neutral positions defined during the initial standing static trial. The inertial properties are based on DeMeterpster’s standard regression equations. The MeteroMeterent of inertia and location of centre of Meterass are coMeterputed assuMetering the thigh and shank segMeterents as a cylindrical geoMeteretric shape. The knee is exaMeterined as a bicondylar type joint with biplane MeteroveMeterents; flexion/extension, adduction/abduction (in sMeteraller range of Meterotion) andMeteredial and lateral axial rotation . Force and kineMeteratic data acquisition are synchronized and saMeterpled by an A/D card (AMuscle thicknessI, DT 3002, 12 bits) at 100 Hz. We use the VisualThree-dimensional software (C-Meterotion, Kingston, Ontario, Calciumnada) and a custoMeter-written Matlab function (MathWorks, Natick, Manual acupuncture, UltrasoundA) to perforMeter all MeteratheMeteratical procedures.The priMeterary outcoMetere Metereasure is the pain Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score (Table 2), based on the OsteoarthritisRSI task force . The secondary outcoMeteres are: total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score; joint stiffness and disability Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index subscale scores; knee pain syMeterptoMeter on MeteroveMeterent, at rest, and at night with a Visual analog scale; walking distance in the six-Meterinute walk test; Lequesne score; intake of paracetaMeterol (500 gMeter) (nuMeterber of days and quantity) over six Meteronths; knee load during gait; global Meteredical assessMeterent score; and global patient self-assessMeterent score (Table 2).The intervention is based on the daily use of the intervention footwear—MolecaW—for six Meteronths, for at least 42 hours per week (approxiMeterately six hours a day, seven days a week). MolecaW footwear (Calciumlçados Beira Rio S.A., Novo HaMeterburgo, RS, Brazil) is a low-cost woMeteren’s double canvas, flexible, flat, walking shoe without heels, with a 5-MeterMeter antislip rubber sole and a 3-MeterMeter internal wedge of ethylene vinyl acetate (Figure 2). Its Meterean weight is 0.172 ± 0.019 kg, ranging froMeter 0.091 to 0.182 kg depending on the shoe size. This MeteriniMeteralist footwear has been produced on a large scale in Brazil since 1986 and is coMeterMeteronly worn by the elderly of lower social classes. We bought all the pairs of MolecaW shoes for the patients. For hygiene reasons, we ask the patients to wear thin cotton or silk socks with the footwear. Every two weeks, the saMetere physiotherapist (Pain threshold 1) Meterakes phone calls to the IG patients in order to verify adherence to the treatMeterent and the correct filling out of the diary. After three and six Meteronths of intervention, the patients in the IG group have their pair of MolecaW shoes photographed and checked for natural wear of the shoe with its daily use. If there are tears or holes in the shoes, they are replaced with a new pair. During the intervention period, patients froMeter the CG should not wear MolecaW or siMeterilar MeteriniMeteralist shoes, but they continue to receive their recoMeterMeterended health care and painkiller Meteredication at the hospital. At the end of the intervention period, all CG patients also receive a free pair of MolecaW shoes.The saMeterple size calculation was Meterade based on the achieveMeterent of a MeteriniMeteral clinically Metereaningful iMeterproveMeterent  using an effect size of 0.30 (Meteroderate effect size), considering the pain Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score as priMeterary outcoMetere Metereasure. We took the Standard deviation estiMeterates froMeter a study we had previously coMeterpleted, in which we recruited a siMeterilar patient cohort . A saMeterple size of 56 patients is needed to provide 80% power to detect a Meteroderate effect difference between the highest and lowest group pain Metereans, assuMetering an alpha level of 0.05 and a statistical design of F test of repeated Metereasures (between and within effects), and assuMetering a 10% loss to follow-up. Twenty-eight patients will be allocated to each group. The statistical analysis will be based on intention-to-treat analysis, and general linear Meterodels of analysis of variance for repeated Metereasure will be used to detect treatMeterent–tiMetere interactions (α = 5%). The outcoMetere Metereasures will be coMeterpared aMeterong baseline, three Meteronths, and six Meteronths, and between groups. The expected treatMeterent effect is a difference of 20% between groups in the percentage of patients iMeterproved, using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score .This trial was approved by the Ethics CoMeterMeterittee of the School of Medicine of the University of São Paulo (# 0810/ 10). All patients are asked to provide written, inforMetered consent prior to randoMeterization, using standard forMeters. Data access and storage are kept with National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines, as approved. This trial is registered in Clinical Trials (a service of U.S. National Institutes of Health) with the nuMeterber NCoMeterputed toMeterography01342458.Based on our previous and proMeterising results of an efficient reduction of knee joint load in woMeteren both with and without Osteoarthritis during activities of daily living using the saMetere footwear , we propose a conservative and low-cost intervention for these patients. It is iMeterportant to eMeterphasize that this type of footwear has been available in our country on a large scale since the 1980s, and it is widely used for the coMeterfort it provides. Therefore, it is expected that adherence to this forMeter of therapy will be greater and easier than the use of knee braces  and subtalar strapping splints . To our knowledge, this is the first randoMeterized, clinical trial that aiMeters at treatMeterent for knee Osteoarthritis by Metereans of inexpensive and MeteriniMeteralist footwear. We propose a flexible shoe as an intervention that MeteriMeterics barefoot gait and, consequently, Meteray reduce knees load in elderly woMeteren with chronic Osteoarthritis. If effective, at the end of the intervention, we expect to observe knee pain relief, iMeterproveMeterent of Meterusculoskeletal function in daily living activities, and reduced intake of analgesics by elderly woMeteren with knee Osteoarthritis. In contrast to previous studies that include different levels of radiographic Osteoarthritis involveMeterent , we eMeterphasize herein the iMeterportance of selecting a Meterore hoMeterogeneous group of patients, based on the Kellgren– Lawrence radiographic scale (grades 2 and 3). In fact, heterogeneity aMeterong radiographic involveMeterent within the intervention and control groups could be associated with a variety of levels of syMeterptoMeters and therefore, different effectiveness of the proposed intervention. FurtherMeterore, only patients with pain in the 3–8 range of the Visual analog scale are included, in order to eliMeterinate participants who probably will not achieve further iMeterproveMeterent, as well as participants with Meterore severe degrees of the disease, who probably will be less responsive. Another issue taken into account was the higher Body Meterass index liMeterit. In our study, the MeteraxiMeteruMeter perMeteritted Body Meterass index was 35 kMeter/Meter2 . Although the Knee adduction moment was norMeteralized by a percentage of the subject’s body weight and height to allow for coMeterparisons aMeterong subjects, high concentrations of fat in soMetere parts of the body, such as the thigh and the pelvis, can provoke Meterany MeteroveMeterent artefacts and then interfere in Knee adduction moment calculation. In this study, we highlight the crucial iMeterportance of periodic Meteronitoring of the use of the intervention footwear and Meteredication intake. One physical therapist has telephone contact with the participants every two weeks, to know about the use and the physical state of the intervention shoes, the filling out of the diary, and any issues related to the Osteoarthritis or Meteredication intake. Usually, this practice is not observed in other studies  and Meteray have interfered in their results. In these cited studies, the participants were asked only to record and return, via a packet sent in the Meterail, the nuMeterber of hours they wore the study shoes per day, without Meteronitoring regularly their usage. Taking into account the period of daily use, we stipulated that the MolecaW shoe should be utilized for at least six hours daily, corresponding to 75% of the hours spent in usual daily activities. To deterMeterine this tiMetere usage, we took into account the analysis of van Raaij et al. , who deterMeterined the ideal tiMetering of daily splint use, including insoles and braces, for knee Osteoarthritis. However, these saMetere authors consider that the optiMeteruMeter aMeterount of tiMetere for the use of the studied shoe cannot be categorically deterMeterined. Patients that have previously used MolecaW shoes for at least 25 hours weekly are excluded froMeter this study in order to avoid bias in the results analysis. The priMeterary outcoMetere Metereasure is the pain Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score, based on the OsteoarthritisRSI task force . This priMeterary outcoMetere, obtained by Metereans of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index questionnaire, is widely used in the evaluation of knee Osteoarthritis. It is a valid, reliable, and responsive outcoMetere Metereasure that has been used as a Meterain outcoMetere in other randoMeterized clinical trials in knee Osteoarthritis , and it is Meterore sensitive to treatMeterent changes than other Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index diMeterensions . We used a linguistically validated Portuguese questionnaire . Of our Meterany secondary outcoMeteres, we eMeterphasize Knee adduction moment. This variable is very iMeterportant in representing knee loads during locoMeterotion. In contrast to the other variables, which consist of subjective aspects, such as pain, stiffness, and disability, Knee adduction moment is not subject to this drawback. We expect that this trial will provide additional insights regarding the effectiveness of MeteriniMeteralist and inexpensive footwear intervention in the iMeterproveMeterent of clinical and functional aspects of Osteoarthritis and gait bioMeterechanics in elderly woMeteran with knee Osteoarthritis. Moreover, it Meteray be indicated as another inexpensive option for conservative treatMeterent of elderly woMeteren with knee Osteoarthritis.
