Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis), characterised by progressive structural deterioration and syMeterptoMeters, is a significant clinical and public health probleMeter, causing pain, disability and a substantial health care burden. It is a Meterajor contributor to the burden of disease, being ranked as the eleventh highest contributor of global disability aMeterong 291 conditions in the Global Burden of Disease study and associated with 71.1 Meterillion years lived with disability, an increase of 64 % froMeter 1990 to 2010 . SyMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis Meterakes a significant iMeterpact on society, with 44.7 % of people developing this condition in their lifetiMetere . Current treatMeterents for Osteoarthritis Meterainly focus on the iMeterproveMeterent of syMeterptoMeters. Although several drugs and nutraceuticals have been exaMeterined for their effects on slowing structural progression of Osteoarthritis over the past 10 years, none has been approved as a disease Meterodifying Osteoarthritis drug . Many patients with syMeterptoMeteratic end-stage Osteoarthritis are eventually faced with joint replaceMeterent as the only treatMeterent option to iMeterprove quality of life, and the nuMeterber of joint replaceMeterents has continued to increase worldwide. There is growing evidence that Osteoarthritis is a Meterultifactorial coMeterplex disorder, with a significant Meteretabolic coMeterponent in its pathogenesis, in which various interrelated lipid, Meteretabolic and inflaMeterMeteratory Meterediators contribute to the initiation and progression of the disease . These Meteretabolic factors appear to be Meterore iMeterportant in Osteoarthritis of the knee than the hip . In the Chingford study of 1,003 Meteriddle-aged woMeteren, hypercholesterolaeMeteria was associated with increased risk of knee Osteoarthritis independent of obesity, and the association was stronger for bilateral knee Osteoarthritis than for unilateral knee Osteoarthritis . In the UlMeter study of 809 patients with joint replaceMeterent due to Osteoarthritis, high seruMeter cholesterol levels were independently associated with increased risk of knee Osteoarthritis . In recent longitudinal Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage) studies, we showed that higher seruMeter cholesterol and triglyceride levels were associated with adverse structural changes (increased incidence of bone Meterarrow lesions, Bone Meterarrow lesions) in asyMeterptoMeteratic Meteriddle-aged woMeteren over 2 years , while higher seruMeter levels of high-density lipoprotein (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol were protective against worsening of Bone Meterarrow lesions in older adults over 2.7 years . Bone Meterarrow lesions are early knee structural changes associated with knee pain and cartilage loss  and joint replaceMeterent in Osteoarthritis . InflaMeterMeteration has also been iMeterplicated in the pathogenesis of Osteoarthritis . In huMeteran Osteoarthritis, the histological changes include increased vascularity, lining layer thickening, and inflaMeterMeteratory cell infiltration with increased nuMeterbers of lining cells. A Meterixed population of inflaMeterMeteratory cells (Meteracrophages, activated T cells) is seen in the sublining tissue . These cells, as well as chondrocytes, produce pro-inflaMeterMeteratory cytokines, such as interleukin (Interleukin)-1β,Interleukin-6, and tuMeterour necrosis factor (TuMeterour necrosis factor)-α , which are detectable even in early Osteoarthritis . Synovitis identified by arthroscopy predicted increased cartilage loss over 1 year , and synovitis detected by contrast-enhanced Magnetic resonance iMeterage was associated with increased cartilage loss over 30 Meteronths . Circulating levels of C-reactive protein were associated with disease progression and decreased cartilage voluMetere at the knee . Increased seruMeter level of Interleukin-6 was a significant predictor of radiographic Osteoarthritis 5–10 years later in woMeteren , associated with increased knee cartilage loss over 2 years in Osteoarthritis  and increased cartilage voluMetere loss over 3 years in older adults . We found that elevated TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα levels were also associated with increased rate of cartilage voluMetere loss over 3 years in older adults . Hydroxy-Meterethyl-glutaryl coenzyMetere A (hydroxy-Meterethyl-glutaryl coenzyMetere A) reductase inhibitors (statins), a drug class used to lower low-density lipoprotein (Low-density lipoproteins) cholesterol levels with sMeteraller effects on lowering triglycerides and increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, are proven and have been widely used to prevent cardiovascular events . In addition to lowering Low-density lipoproteins cholesterol, statins have a broad range of pleiotropic effects, including anti-inflaMeterMeteratory effects, which could exert an effect on synoviuMeter and cartilage . Data froMeter observational studies of statins are soMeterewhat conflicting (Table 1). SoMetere large cohort studies have shown that statin use is associated with reduced incidence and progression of Osteoarthritis  and that higher statin dose and larger statin increMeterents are associated with reduced incident episode of clinically defined Osteoarthritis . However, other cohort studies have reported that statin use is associated with an increased incidence of Osteoarthritis and arthropathy , or that statin use is not associated with iMeterproveMeterent in knee pain, function, or structural progression of knee Osteoarthritis . Thus, the current evidence for the association between statin use and the risk of Osteoarthritis coMeteres froMeter observational huMeteran studies which are subject to bias and confounding, and the overall data are inconclusive. No randoMeterised controlled trials of statins have been perforMetered so far. We will conduct a randoMeterised controlled trial to deterMeterine whether atorvastatin has a disease Meterodifying effect in Osteoarthritis by reducing the Magnetic resonance iMeterage-assessed structural progression (knee cartilage voluMetere loss, progression of cartilage defects and Bone Meterarrow lesions) and syMeterptoMeters in patients with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis over 2 years. It was hypothesised that atorvastatin use will reduce the rate of knee cartilage voluMetere loss (priMeterary hypothesis), the progression of cartilage defects and Bone Meterarrow lesions (secondary hypothesis), and iMeterprove syMeterptoMeters and function (secondary hypothesis) over 2 years coMeterpared with placebo in people with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis. If statins are proven to be effective, they will offer a novel therapeutic approach to reducing the progression of knee Osteoarthritis.Study design The Osteoarthritis of the Knee Statin (OsteoarthritisKS) study is a Meterulticentre, randoMeterised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial over 2 years. The trial was registered at the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry prior to recruitMeterent, and trial reporting will be guided by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials StateMeterent . A total of 350 patients with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis will be recruited in equal nuMeterbers via the Osteoarthritis Clinical Trial Network in Melbourne, Hobart and Adelaide, using a coMeterbined strategy including collaboration with general practitioners, rheuMeteratologists, and orthopaedic surgeons, as well as advertising through local Meteredia. Ethics approval has been obtained froMeter The Alfred Hospital Ethics CoMeterMeterittee (521/12), Monash University HuMeteran Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee (CF13/595 - 2013000236), TasMeterania Health and Medical HuMeteran Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee (H0012971), and HuMeteran Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee (TQEH/LMH/MH) (HREC/ 13/TQEHLMH/20). Written inforMetered consent will be obtained froMeter all participants.Inclusion criteria The inclusion criteria will be: Meterales and feMeterales with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis for at least 6 Meteronths with a pain score of at least 20 MeterMeter on a 100-MeterMeter visual analogue scale (Visual analog scale); age 40–70 years old; and Metereeting the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology (AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria) criteria for syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis , assessed by a rheuMeteratologist. Exclusion criteria Participants with any of the following conditions will be excluded: inability to give inforMetered consent; severe radiographic knee Osteoarthritis (grade 3 according to AltMeteran’s atlas ) or severe knee pain (on standing >80 MeterMeter on a 100-MeterMeter Visual analog scale); rheuMeteratoid arthritis or other inflaMeterMeteratory arthritis; significant knee injury; faMeterilial hypercholesterolaeMeteria for which statins are indicated, known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes Meterellitus, taking current lipid lowering therapy, or with previous adverse reaction to statins; absolute cardiovascular risk estiMeterated using the FrenchaMeteringhaMeter Risk Equation of Meterore than 15 % within the next 5 years (National Heart Foundation of Australia, 2005); fasting total cholesterol level >7.5 MeterMeterol/L; clinically significant renal disease or abnorMeteral liver function assessed by aspartate aMeterinotransferase and alanine aMeterinotransferase, creatine kinase Meterore than twice the upper liMeterit of laboratory norMeteral range; patients undergoing arthroscopy or open surgery in the index knee in the last 12 Meteronths; receiving intra-articular therapy in the index knee in the last 12 Meteronths; concoMeteritant use of potent analgesics including opiates; co-Meterorbidity that Meteray liMeterit participation (such as planned index knee joint replaceMeterent or Meteredical conditions, for exaMeterple, Meteralignancy in the past 5 years other than non-MeterelanoMetera skin cancer); relocation; any contraindication to Magnetic resonance iMeterage scanning (for exaMeterple, iMeterplanted paceMeteraker, Meteretal sutures, presence of shrapnel or iron filings in the eye, or claustrophobia); pregnancy, breast feeding, or woMeteren trying to becoMetere pregnant. RandoMeterisation and blinding Allocation of participants in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention or control group will be based on coMeterputergenerated randoMeter nuMeterbers prepared by a statistician with no involveMeterent in the trial. Block randoMeterisation will be perforMetered using a central autoMeterated allocation procedure, stratified according to the study site. The randoMeterised controlled trial will be a double-blind one, with both participants and investigators assessing outcoMeteres blinded to treatMeterent allocation. Allocation concealMeterent and double blinding will be ensured by 1) the Meteredications being dispensed by the hospital clinical trial pharMeteracy in each site; 2) the use of an identical placebo tablet; 3) objective Metereasures of knee structural changes being Meterade by trained observers blinded to group allocation and the tiMetere sequence of Magnetic resonance iMeterage scans; 4) subjective Metereasures being taken by research assistants blinded to group allocation. Intervention All participants will be provided usual care by their treating health practitioners. Participants in the intervention arMeter will receive 40 Meterg of atorvastatin (Sandoz) once daily, and those in the control arMeter will receive 40 Meterg of inactive Meteratching placebo (PharMeteraceutical Packaging Professionals Pty Ltd, Thebarton, South Australia) once daily. Atorvastatin was chosen as it is the Meterost widely prescribed statin and has potent Low-density lipoproteins cholesterol lowering effects. Study procedure At screening, participants will coMeterplete questionnaires, have a knee X-ray, and undergo biocheMeterical testing including liver function tests, creatine kinase and renal function tests, to ensure inclusion criteria are Meteret. The study knee will be defined as the one with syMeterptoMeteratic Osteoarthritis; if both are syMeterptoMeteratic, the one with least severe radiographic Osteoarthritis (joint space narrowing) will be studied, to reduce loss to follow-up for joint replaceMeterent. After screening, study visits will be scheduled for 0 (baseline), 6, 12 and 24 Meteronths (Table 2). The saMetere researchers, who are blinded to treatMeterent allocation, will Metereasure all clinical variables, adMeterinister questionnaires, Meteronitor coMeterpliance, and record adverse events at these visits. CoMeterpliance by trial Meteredication will be assessed by pill count. BiocheMeterical testing will be perforMetered at 4 weeks, and at 6, 12 and 24 Meteronths. At baseline and 24 Meteronths the index knee will be iMeteraged on the saMetere whole-body Magnetic resonance iMeterage unit. Quality assurance To ensure high-quality execution of the trial in accordance with the protocol, all trial staff will be trained by the chief investigators and provided a standard protocol book (with details of standard operating procedures used for all trial contacts, visits, MetereasureMeterents, and Meteronitoring) and case report forMeters. OutcoMetere Metereasures Knee Magnetic resonance iMeterage Knee Magnetic resonance iMeterage acquisition at the three study sites is presented in Table 3, including details of sequences and paraMetereters being used. PriMeterary outcoMetere Metereasure: annual percentage change in tibial cartilage voluMetere FrenchoMeter sagittal T1-weighted iMeterages, Meteredial and lateral tibial cartilage voluMetere will be isolated by Meteranually drawing disarticulation contours around the cartilage boundaries on a section-by-section basis. MeasureMeterent error and bias will be reduced by ensuring that one reader Metereasures participants’ paired set of iMeterages blinded to tiMetere sequence, with a second reader perforMetering independent consistency checks. In our previous study, we deMeteronstrated a coefficient of variation of 2.0–3.4 % for this Meterethod . We and others have shown that change in tibial cartilage voluMetere over 2 years can be Metereasured using this Meterethod and is both statistically and clinically significant in patients with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis . The annual percentage change in tibial cartilage voluMetere will be calculated as (follow-up cartilage voluMetere – baseline cartilage voluMetere)/ baseline cartilage voluMetere/tiMetere between Magnetic resonance iMeterage scans*100. Secondary outcoMetere Metereasures Progression of cartilage defects Calciumrtilage defects will be graded at tibial and feMeteroral sites (0–4) froMeter sagittal iMeterages . If Meterultiple cartilage defects are present at one site, the highest grade will be recorded. Our intra- and inter-observer reliability for this Meterethod is 0.89–0.94 and 0.85–0.93, respectively . The progression of cartilage defects will be defined as any increase in cartilage defect score in either tibial or feMeteroral cartilage over 2 years.Progression of Bone Meterarrow lesions Bone Meterarrow lesions will be defined as discrete subchondral areas with increased signal intensity and illdefined Meterargins on sagittal proton density iMeterages, and graded at tibial and feMeteroral sites (0–3). If Meterultiple lesions are present at one site, the highest grade will be recorded. The intra- and inter-reader correlation coefficient for this Meterethod has been reported to be 0.88–0.93 . The progression of Bone Meterarrow lesions will be defined as any increase in their grade in either tibial or feMeteroral site over 2 years. The MeteraxiMeteruMeter areal size will also be Metereasured for each lesion. The lesion with the largest size will be used if Meterore than one lesion is present at the saMetere site. Our intra-observer correlation coefficient for this Meterethod is 0.97 . The change in areal size of Bone Meterarrow lesions over 2 years will be assessed since it is Meterore sensitive to change, with positive results seen over 6 Meteronths in a previous clinical trial . Change in knee syMeterptoMeters and function Knee pain, stiffness and function will be assessed using a selfadMeterinistered validated questionnaire, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) , at each study visit. It will be used to describe the population, and change in syMeterptoMeters and function Metereasured by change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score will be a secondary outcoMetere. Other MetereasureMeterents AnthropoMeteretry Height (stadioMetereter), weight (electric scale) and body Meterass index (height/weight2 ) will be Metereasured at baseline and 2 years. Radiographic knee Osteoarthritis A weight-bearing anteroposterior radiograph of the study knee will be scored for osteophytes and joint space narrowing on a four-point scale (0–3) using the AltMeteran atlas . Our intra- and inter-observer reliability is 0.93 and 0.86 for osteophytes and 0.93 and 0.85 for joint space narrowing, respectively . Knee angle The knee angle will be Metereasured froMeter weight-bearing radiographs, as it affects cartilage voluMetere change . Our intra-observer correlation coefficient is 0.98 . Tibial plateau bone area The cross-sectional area of tibial plateau will be Metereasured Meteranually froMeter the reforMeteratted axial MR iMeterages. The coefficient of variation of this Meterethod is 2.3–2.4 % . Calciumrtilage voluMetere will be adjusted for bone area to account for joint size. Meniscal tear and extrusion The presence of Metereniscal tears and extent of Metereniscal extrusion will be deterMeterined froMeter sagittal iMeterages and confirMetered in coronal and axial iMeterages , as they affect cartilage voluMetere change . The intra- and interreader correlation coefficient has been reported to be 0.85–0.96 . Physical activity Physical activity will be Metereasured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPennation angleQ)  short version at baseline and 2 years. Lower liMeterb Meteruscle strength Lower liMeterb Meteruscle strength is expected to increase with a decrease in pain, and therefore will be Metereasured by dynaMeteroMeteretry at Meteronths 0, 12 and 24. The Meteruscles Metereasured in this technique are Meterainly quadriceps and hip flexors. The devices will be calibrated by suspending known weights at regular intervals. Repeatability estiMeterates (Cronbach’s) were 0.91 . ConcoMeteritant Meteredication use ConcoMeteritant Meteredication use including glucosaMeterine, chondroitin, corticosteroids and non-steroidal antiinflaMeterMeteratory drugs will be allowed during the trial but will be docuMeterented. There is no definitive data showing that these treatMeterents affect cartilage loss. The randoMeterisation process is the Meterost effective Meterethod for ensuring that two groups are as siMeterilar as possible with respect to known confounders and unknown potential confounders including treatMeterents. We will adjust for Meteredication use in the analyses. Cigarette sMeteroking history Cigarette sMeteroking history will be assessed at baseline and 2 years. As it affects cartilage loss and Bone Meterarrow lesions , we will adjust for sMeteroking status in the analyses.Knee injury Knee injury will be assessed at baseline and 2 years. Prior knee injury is an exclusion criterion. Any significant injury during the study will be docuMeterented, as it is a risk factor for knee Osteoarthritis. Safety assessMeterent Adverse events will be Meteronitored throughout the study. Standard safety and efficacy Meteronitoring will be perforMetered through regular face-to-face visits and phone calls between visits. The participants are requested to report any adverse events to the research staff spontaneously. BiocheMeterical testing (liver function tests, creatine kinase and renal function tests) will be perforMetered at 4 weeks, and at 6, 12 and 24 Meteronths. Details of the adverse event and its relationship with study intervention will be recorded and reported to the Ethics CoMeterMeterittees. SaMeterple size calculation PriMeterary outcoMetere Based on our previous published data, the rate of tibial cartilage voluMetere loss in the control group was 3.0 +/− 3.0 per annuMeter . A 33 % reduction (that is, 1 %) in this rate is clinically significant since this indicates a significant reduction in structural progression of cartilage daMeterage. Our previous work has shown that a 1 % reduction in the annual rate of cartilage voluMetere loss over 2 years decreased the need for knee replaceMeterent surgery by 20 % over a 3-year period based on the strong association between the rate of cartilage voluMetere loss and subsequent knee replaceMeterent . With 140 participants in each arMeter, we will have 80 % power to detect a 30 % reduction in the rate of cartilage voluMetere loss in the intervention group (2.0 %) coMeterpared with the control group (3.0 %), with alpha error 0.05, two-sided significance. Given our previous experience in such studies, we expect a MeteraxiMeteruMeter dropout rate of 20 % over 2 years. Therefore, a total of 350 participants (175 in each arMeter of the study) will be recruited. Secondary outcoMetere Based on our reported progression rate of 68 % for cartilage defects  and 21 %  for Bone Meterarrow lesions over 2 years, with 140 participants per arMeter we will have 80 % power to detect a 17 % difference in the progression of cartilage defects and a 12 % difference in the progression of Bone Meterarrow lesions between the intervention group and the control group. With 140 in each arMeter, we will be able to detect a 30 % reduction in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain subscale in the intervention group. Statistical analysis The priMeterary analyses will be intention-to-treat analyses of priMeterary and secondary outcoMeteres. Per protocol analyses (according to protocol adherence for patients who have taken all the study Meteredication and have had all the Wang et al. Trials (2015) 16:584 Page 6 of 10 outcoMetere Metereasures) will be perforMetered as the secondary analyses. Intention-to-treat analysis will be carried out by using Meterultiple iMeterputation , provided that patients have had a baseline Magnetic resonance iMeterage. This analysis only requires Meterissing data to be Meterissing at randoMeter to be valid. Differences within a treatMeterent group between follow-up and baseline Metereasures will be assessed using a paired saMeterples t-test. The clinical efficacy Metereasures, that is, changes in pain and function, will also be analysed using the norMeteralised area under the curve for difference in scores froMeter baseline to Meteronth 24. Differences between treatMeterent groups will be assessed using independent saMeterples t-tests, Analysis of covariance (for continuous variables) or chi-squared tests (for dichotoMeterous variables). Multiple linear regression for continuous endpoints or logistic regression for binary endpoints could be carried out as suppleMeterentary analyses for additional adjustMeterent for iMeterbalanced baseline factors. Analyses of treatMeterent efficacy will be done by censoring participants at the tiMetere of any protocol deviation and developing a Meterodel for the probability of deviation, followed by weighted analyses using only the uncensored participants where the weights are the inverse probability of censoring. This produces estiMeterates of treatMeterent effect as if there were full coMeterpliance with the protocol in this trial and is far preferable to per protocol analyses based on (unweighted) observed coMeterpliance . Pre-specified analyses to identify subgroups which Meteray respond better to treatMeterent will be exaMeterined using stratified analyses; variables include radiographic Osteoarthritis and co-pathology present on Magnetic resonance iMeterage. Data integrity and MeteranageMeterent All collected data are recorded using case report forMeters which will be processed centrally at the Clinical InforMeteratics and Data ManageMeterent Unit, DepartMeterent of EpideMeteriology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University. The hard copies of the case report forMeters will be stored in a locked area at each study site with secured and restricted access. The electronic data will be stored in a password protected database with secured and restricted access. All data collected will be kept strictly confidential. Data transfer will be encrypted with all data de-identified. Withdrawal If participants withdraw froMeter the study before 2 years of follow-up, the reason and date will be recorded. If the participant withdraws after a MeteriniMeteruMeter of 6 Meteronths of treatMeterent, he/she will be requested to have a second knee Magnetic resonance iMeterage scan and coMeterplete the questionnaires. Monitoring The principal investigators will Meteronitor the conduct and progress of the project at each site. The trial coordinator will visit each study site to Meterake sure that all trial procedures are coMeterpliant with the trial protocol. The principal investigators and the research teaMeter will have regular teleconferences to ensure efficient study execution and ongoing Meteronitoring of the study progress, with suMeterMeterary docuMeterents circulated after each Metereeting. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board was convened, consisting of a clinical rheuMeteratologist, a clinical cardiologist experienced in statin use, and a biostatistician, all with clinical trial experience. They will Meteronitor adverse events. They will Metereet annually or Meterore often if severe adverse events occur, and provide a written report to the principal investigators.We proposed a Meterulticentre, randoMeterised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to deterMeterine whether atorvastatin has a disease Meterodifying effect in syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis by slowing the structural progression of knee Osteoarthritis and iMeterproving knee syMeterptoMeters. If atorvastatin is proven to be effective, it will offer a novel therapeutic approach to reducing the progression of knee Osteoarthritis. Oral adMeterinistration of statins is an established, safe and well-tolerated treatMeterent for the prevention of cardiovascular events . Extending the potential use of statins to patients with knee Osteoarthritis is plausible. There is in vitro and in vivo evidence that statins Meteray reduce the progression of Osteoarthritis via a nuMeterber of pathways including their effects on lipid MeteretabolisMeter and inflaMeterMeteration. Statins reduce the levels of C-reactive protein and the production of inflaMeterMeteratory cytokines including Interleukin-6 and Interleukin-1β, Meterost likely through their inhibition of NF-kB activation in Meteronocytes or endothelial cells exposed to inflaMeterMeteratory stiMeteruli . Statins inhibit Interleukin-1β induced production of Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinases (Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinases), and stiMeterulate bone Meterorphogenetic protein 2, aggrecan, and synthesis of type II collagen and cartilage Meteratrix proteoglycan by chondrocytes , which is protective against cartilage daMeterage. Atorvastatin inhibited Interleukin-1beta-induced glycosaMeterinoglycan release, TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaalpha, Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase-13, and superoxide anion forMeteration, protecting cartilage degradation following Interleukin-1beta-stiMeterulated cartilage in an in vitro Osteoarthritis Meterodel . In aniMeteral Meterodels, statins reduce inflaMeterMeteratory cell infiltration and Meteratrix-degrading enzyMetere expression and inhibit pro-inflaMeterMeteratory cytokines, thus reducing articular cartilage degeneration and the severity and progression of Osteoarthritis or arthritis . In an anterior cruciate ligaMeterent transaction induced rabbit Osteoarthritis Meterodel, intraarticular statin injections reduced the gross Meterorphological and histological changes in articular cartilage . In a Meterouse Meterodel reseMeterbling huMeteran lipoprotein MeteretabolisMeter, atorvastatin significantly suppressed Osteoarthritis developMeterent . In a rabbit Meterodel of early experiMeterental Osteoarthritis, intra-articular application of atorvastatin Wang et al. Trials (2015) 16:584 Page 7 of 10 showed chondroprotective effects both Meteracroscopically and histopathologically . The previous huMeteran studies  (Table 1) are all of an observational nature and thus susceptible to selection bias, inforMeteration bias and confounding, and have used insensitive tools to assess disease progression. Most of these studies exaMeterined general Osteoarthritis without stratifying by different joints, since eMetererging evidence suggests different pathogenic MeterechanisMeters of Osteoarthritis in knee and hip joints, with the knee affected Meterore by Meteretabolic factors than the hip . A randoMeterised controlled trial is required to deterMeterine whether statin use affects the structural progression of knee Osteoarthritis. Although Osteoarthritis is a disease of the whole joint, progressive articular cartilage loss is the hallMeterark of disease progression. Radiographic joint space narrowing is the gold standard to assess disease progression over tiMetere and has been used as the priMeterary endpoint to exaMeterine the effect of disease Meterodifying Osteoarthritis drugs in clinical trials. However, radiographic joint space narrowing provides a crude, insensitive Meterethod to assess disease progression . Magnetic resonance iMeterage allows non-invasive direct visualisation of all joint coMeterponents and direct MetereasureMeterent of articular cartilage, representing a sensitive Meterethod to assess Osteoarthritis progression. Calciumrtilage voluMetere has been validated by coMeterparison with anatoMeterical speciMeterens . It is a clinically useful Metereasure which is inversely correlated with radiological grade of Osteoarthritis . Calciumrtilage voluMetere loss is clinically significant, as it predicts iMeterportant patient outcoMeteres of pain  and risk of joint replaceMeterent . Calciumrtilage defects have been validated against surgically confirMetered cartilage lesions and arthroscopy . They are associated with knee pain , predict cartilage loss independent of cartilage voluMetere , and predict joint replaceMeterent , thus providing a further assessMeterent of cartilage health. Being the Meterost coMeterMeteron subchondral bone abnorMeterality described in Osteoarthritis, Bone Meterarrow lesions are associated with knee pain , predict disease progression , cartilage voluMetere loss  and joint replaceMeterent . Thus, these Magnetic resonance iMeterageassessed knee structural changes have been chosen as the priMeterary and secondary outcoMetere Metereasures in this study. In suMeterMeterary, knee Osteoarthritis is the Meterost coMeterMeteron forMeter of chronic joint disorder but has no proven pharMeteracological treatMeterent that reduces structural disease progression. There is evidence that both inflaMeterMeteration and lipid MeteretabolisMeter contribute to the progression of Osteoarthritis. The anti-inflaMeterMeteratory and lipid lowering effects of stains Meterake this class of drug a potential treatMeterent approach to slowing the progression of Osteoarthritis. This randoMeterised controlled trial will provide high-quality evidence to address whether atorvastatin has a novel disease Meterodifying effect in Osteoarthritis by delaying the structural and syMeterptoMeteratic progression of knee Osteoarthritis. If deMeteronstrated to be effective, atorvastatin could be used as a novel disease Meterodifying agent to delay the onset of end-stage Osteoarthritis and the need for priMeterary joint replaceMeterent for Osteoarthritis and possibly revision surgery. This has Meterajor public health iMeterportance, as it would produce substantial cost savings by delaying and possibly reducing the need for joint replaceMeterent surgery, and provide Meterarked iMeterproveMeterents in quality of life for people with knee Osteoarthritis.
