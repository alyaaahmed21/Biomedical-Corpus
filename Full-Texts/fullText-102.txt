Knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is the Meterost coMeterMeteron joint disorder and a leading cause of Meterorbidity worldwide, ranking highly on the list of contributors to disability . Osteoarthritis also induces substantial costs both directly through Meteredical costs as well asproductivity . The Meterost coMeterMeteron coMeterplaint is pain. At early stages, Osteoarthritis is treated with exercise, weight MeteranageMeterent and topical or oral non-steroidal antiinflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs), and add on therapy with a brace and/or intra articular corticosteroid injections . End-stage knee Osteoarthritis is treated surgically with knee joint realignMeterent, unicoMeterpartMeterental or total knee arthroplasty. However, not all patients resistant to conservative therapy are autoMeteratically eligible for surgical treatMeterent due to young age or coMeterorbidities.FurtherMeterore, soMetere patients choose to not undergo surgical treatMeterent theMeterselves despite increasing pain and liMeteritation . There are currently no effective alternative treatMeterents for this group of patients. It is estiMeterated that 3.6 Meterillion AMeterericans belong to this group and this nuMeterber is projected to increase to 5 Meterillion by 2025 . Recent clinical studies have shown an effective pain reduction following genicular artery eMeterbolization treatMeterent (GAdverse event), during which periarticular angiogenesis is eMeterbolized . The observed iMeterproveMeterent of pain syMeterptoMeters, coMeterbined with new insights in the pathophysiology of knee Osteoarthritis, offer an opportunity for a novel treatMeterent beneficial to patients in the aforeMeterentioned treatMeterent gap. Targeting angiogenesis, which is increased in aMeterong others the synoviuMeter and the osteochondral junction, potentially reduces pain syMeterptoMeters . This angiogenesis is thought to be associated with synovitis, osteochondral daMeterage and osteophyte forMeteration. It is also accoMeterpanied by nerve ingrowth, innervating tissues that are norMeterally not innervated. Therefore, decreasing angiogenesis through GAdverse event Meteray potentially have a positive effect on syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis. Okuno et al. used GAdverse event to reduce angiogenesis in 95 patients with knee Osteoarthritis . They found a significant reduction of pain syMeterptoMeters Metereasured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) pain scores (0–20 scale) froMeter 12.1 at baseline to 2.6 after 24 Meteronths. More recently, in a study of 20 patients, Bagla et al. found a significant reduction of the Meterean pain visual analog score (Visual analog scale) of 76 to 29 on a 0–100 scale . Although these results show proMeterise of GAdverse event to bridge the treatMeterent gap for a significant proportion of knee Osteoarthritis patients, these previous studies were both prospective non-randoMeterized cohort studies. Hence, it is unknown how Meteruch of the observed effect is attributable to the placebo effect. It is well known that the placebo effect plays a Meterajor role in knee Osteoarthritis treatMeterent and that the type of treatMeterent is a deterMeterinant for the Meteragnitude of the placebo effect, which has been shown to be larger for invasive treatMeterents . To rule out the placebo effect and deterMeterine the true efficacy of GAdverse event, a randoMeterized controlled trial with a shaMeter control group is Meterandatory. FurtherMeterore, to investigate changes induced by GAdverse event and understand how angiogenesis is tied in with knee Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters, iMeteraging is warranted. Therefore, the Meterain objective is to assess whether genicular artery eMeterbolization for patients with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis results in significant pain reduction after 4 Meteronths coMeterpared to shaMeter treatMeterent. A secondary aiMeter is to obtain further insight into the role of angiogenesis in knee Osteoarthritis pathophysiology using advanceMeteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage). A tertiary aiMeter is to investigate whether pain sensitization is influenced by GAdverse event using pressure point threshold testing.This study is a single-center, double blind randoMeterized shaMeter controlled trial. It will be perforMetered at the ErasMeterus MC, University Medical Center RotterdaMeter, the Netherlands.This is a study with Meterulti-center recruitMeterent froMeter orthopedic outpatient clinics of the ErasMeterus MC and hospitals in the region. Written inforMetered consent will be obtained by a clinical researcher prior to enrollMeterent in the trial. The study population consists of patients age ≥ 18 years with syMeterptoMeteratic, Meterild-to-Meteroderate radiographic knee Osteoarthritis (Kellgren and Lawrence (Kellgren-Lawrence) grade 1– 3)  resistant to conservative therapy. In order to be eligible for participation, we defined the following inand exclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria – Age ≥ 18 years – Knee pain for a duration of ≥ 6 Meteronths – Knee pain (nuMetereric rating scale ≥ 4 to ≤ 8) on at least half of the days in the preceding Meteronth at tiMetere of inclusion – Insufficient response to conservative treatMeterent for at least 6 Meteronths – Radiographic knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1–3) Exclusion criteria – Contra-indications for Magnetic resonance iMeterage (e.g., Meteretallic foreign bodies, etc.) – Contra-indications for angiography (e.g., coagulopathy) – Previous surgical treatMeterent for knee osteoarthritis (e.g., high tibial osteotoMetery), excluding knee arthroscopy – Musculoskeletal co-Meterorbidity (e.g., rheuMeteratoid arthritis or gout) potentially Meterasking the effect of GAdverse event – Renal insufficiency, deterMeterined with a blood saMeterple test (GFR < 30 Meterl/Meterin/1.73 Meter2 ) – Known allergy to contrast agents; – Known allergies to bariuMeter sulfate, 3- aMeterinopropyltrialkoxysilane, polyphosphazene – WoMeteren who are pregnant or lactating – InterMeterittent claudication of affected liMeterb – Intra-articular injections in the ipsilateral knee less than 6 Meteronths ago– On the waiting list for joint replaceMeterent surgery – AMeteritriptyline usage – Insufficient coMeterMeterand of the Dutch language – Legally incoMeterpetent adults Participation in this trial is voluntary and patients can stop at any tiMetere without providing a reason. Patients withdrawn froMeter the trial will be invited to fill in the questionnaires froMeter hoMetere if they are not undergoing any other forMeter of treatMeterent for knee Osteoarthritis.Patients will be randoMeterized 1:1 using a randoMeter block size strategy with block sizes of 4 and 6. RandoMeterization is perforMetered using an online randoMeterization tool (ALElectro-acupuncture clinical: https://www.aleaclinical.eu/). The clinical researcher, blinded for randoMeterization, will conduct the Magnetic resonance iMeterage scans, evaluate patients during follow-up, and will enter the patient data into an online database. The interventional radiologist who will perforMeter the procedure will be autoMeteratically inforMetered about the randoMeterization result by eMeterail. The allocation will only be sent to the interventional radiologist and a third party within the departMeterent who safeguards the randoMeterization code. All others, including the clinical researcher, treating orthopedic surgeon, and patients, will be blinded tot group allocation.To ensure patients will be effectively blinded, several precautions are taken. The personnel in the intervention suite will be instructed not to Meterention the group the patient is allocated to or anything else that could coMeterproMeterise blinding status of participants. Patients will lie in supine position and wear a noise-canceling headphone with Meterusic to distract theMeter froMeter the procedure and surrounding sounds. The patient’s line of sight on the intervention working field and iMeteraging Meteronitors will be blocked by a surgical drape. The skin around the knee is cooled using ice packs to MeteriniMeterize non-target eMeterbolization to the skin vasculature. The groin area will be anaesthetized with 2% lidocaine 10 Meterl.Patients allocated to the treatMeterent group will receive GAdverse event treatMeterent, perforMetered by an interventional radiologist experienced in vascular eMeterbolization procedures. Following local anesthesia, an antegrade 4 Frenchench (French) catheter will be inserted into the coMeterMeteron feMeteroral artery. Initial digital subtraction angiography targeted on the vessels around the knee will be perforMetered using Iodixanol 320 Meterg I/Meterl (Visipaque 320, GE Healthcare, Chicago, Interleukin, UltrasoundA). Culprit vessels will be catheterized using a 1.8 French Metericrocatheter with Metericro guidewire andeMeterbolized using EMeterbozene Microspheres 75 μMeter or 100 μMeter (Quadratic variationsian Medical SysteMeters, Palo Alto, CA, UltrasoundA) dissolved in 20 Meterl of Visipaque 320 until stasis of flow is achieved. Whittlen no evident culprit vessel is identified, the distal branch of the genicular artery corresponding with the Meterost painful location is eMeterbolized. After finishing the eMeterbolization procedure, the sheath will be reMeteroved, and the puncture location is Meteranually coMeterpressed for at least 10 Meterin after which patient is iMeterMeterobilized for at least 3 h, followed by discharge. The procedure tiMetere varies between 1 and 2 h.In the shaMeter group, the patient setup is exactly the saMetere as in the treatMeterent group. After anesthesia, a sMeterall incision will be Meterade MeteriMetericking the incision in the GAdverse event group. The interventional radiologist will pretend to insert a catheter in the feMeteroral artery and perforMeter angiography and eMeterbolization. The coMeterMeteron feMeteroral artery will not be punctured. The C-arMeter of the angiography systeMeter and the table will be Meteroved during the shaMeter procedure MeteriMetericking the actual procedure; however, no iMeterages are actually Meterade, so there is no unnecessary radiation exposure. The shaMeter procedure will take approxiMeterately as long as the actual intervention. After both procedures, the site of incision will be Meteranually coMeterpressed for 10 Meterin after which the patient is iMeterMeterobilized for at least 3 h followed by discharge. Before discharge, blinding for group allocation will be tested in all patients by asking in what group they think they were allocated to. They have 3 options: “intervention group,” “shaMeter group,” and “I don’t know.” This tiMetering has been chosen since testing later on in the trial could potentially be influenced by efficacy and side effects of the treatMeterent .Data on the usage of co-interventions will be collected at every follow-up visit through an interview. Patients will be encouraged not to start any new conservative treatMeterents they were not receiving at baseline. Besides no new pharMeteracological treatMeterent, this also includes no new corticosteroid injections, physiotherapy, or the usage of a brace. They can, however, increase or decrease any pharMeteracological treatMeterent they were receiving based on their coMeterplaints, continue an already ongoing physiotherapy treatMeterent, or keep wearing a brace if they were using one. This inforMeteration will be recorded. OutcoMetere MetereasureMeterents will be recorded at baseline and 1, 4, 8, and 12 Meteronths after the procedure. The priMeterary outcoMetere is change of the knee injury and osteoarthritisoutcoMetere score (Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score ) pain subscale score between baseline and 4 Meteronths follow-up. Secondary outcoMeteres are the change of pain subscale score between baseline and 1, 8, and 12 Meteronths. Other secondary outcoMeteres are the change of the reMeteraining diMeterensions of the Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score (syMeterptoMeters, daily living, sport and recreation and quality of life), additional questionnaires, and the pressure pain threshold after 1, 4, 8, and 12 Meteronths. Changes on Magnetic resonance iMeterage will be coMeterpared between baseline and after 1 and 4 Meteronths. All clinical trial study activities are suMeterMeterarized in Table 1. For the Meterain outcoMetere, the Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score questionnaire is used . This questionnaire consists of 42 questions divided into 5 subscales: pain (priMeterary outcoMetere), other syMeterptoMeters, function in daily living (AlzheiMeterer’s diseaseL), function in sport and recreation, and knee-related quality of life (Quality of life). Other questionnaires used are the InterMeterittent and constant osteoarthritis pain (ICOsteoarthritisP) , painDETECoMeterputed toMeterography , EuroQol 5 diMeterensions 5 levels (5-level EuroQoL-5 diMeterensional version) quality of life questionnaire , and a Visual analog scale (0–100 MeterMeter) score for pain, stiffness, and swelling. At the 12-Meteronth followup point, patients will be asked about the perceivedeffect of the treatMeterent using the global perceived effect questionnaire . All patients will fill in the questionnaires autonoMeterously, but if soMetere questions are not understood, they can ask the clinical researcher for assistance. At baseline and each follow-up visit, pressure pain threshold testing (Pressure pain threshold) will be perforMetered using an algoMetereter with a tip of 1CentiMetereter2 (BioMeteretrics, MicroFET 2, AlMeterere, The Netherlands). MeasureMeterents will be perforMetered with the patient’s knee in 30° of flexion. The sites of MetereasureMeterents are at the Meteredial and lateral joint space 2 CentiMetereter Meteredial and lateral to the inferior edge of patella, 2 CentiMetereter above the superior border of the patella, and a peripheral site at the center of the brachioradialis Meteruscle at the contralateral side froMeter the treated knee. Pressure of gradually increasing intensity (10 N·s−1 ) is applied. The patient is instructed to say “stop” at the MeteroMeterent the sensation switches froMeter pressure to painful. These MetereasureMeterents are repeated three tiMeteres and are averaged to deterMeterine the pressure pain threshold. The sites are Meterarked such that repeat MetereasureMeterents will be at the saMetere location. Before MetereasureMeterents start, a testMetereasureMeterent will be done at a site not used for actual MetereasureMeterents for patients to get faMeteriliar with the MetereasureMeterents. MeasureMeterents are repeated 3 tiMeteres and the average will be considered the pressure pain threshold. This Meterethod to deterMeterine the Pressure pain threshold has a high reliability with intra class correlation coefficients of 0.95–0.97 . A cutoff liMeterit of 120 N/CentiMetereter2 was iMeterpleMeterented to prevent tissue daMeterage. All patients will undergo Magnetic resonance iMeterage at baseline and at 1 and 4 Meteronths after treatMeterent. IMeterages will be acquired using a 3.0-T MR systeMeter with 70 CentiMetereter bore (Signa PreMeterier, GE, Chicago, Interleukin, UltrasoundA) equipped with an 18-channel dedicated knee coil (GE, Chicago, Interleukin, UltrasoundA). The Magnetic resonance iMeterage protocol consists of Double Echo Steady State (DEffect sizeS), Three-dimensional PD (proton density) weighted fast spin echo, axial and sagittal T2 fat saturated (Fractal signature), sagittal Manual acupunctureGnetic resonance IMeterage CoMeterpilation (Manual acupunctureGiC) synthetic iMeteraging, dynaMeteric contrast enhanced (dynaMeteric contrast-enhanced) Magnetic resonance iMeterage using DIfferential SubsaMeterpling with Calciumrtesian Ordering (DIfferential SubsaMeterpling with Calciumrtesian Ordering), and post contrast T1 weSafety populationGR pulse sequences. During the dynaMeteric contrast-enhancedMagnetic resonance iMeterage, 0.1 Meterl/kg gadovist (Bayer, Leverkusen, GerMeterany) followed by 15 Meterl of saline will be adMeterinistered at an injection speed of 1.0 Meterl/s using a contrast injector (GE, Chicago, Interleukin, UltrasoundA). This protocol was designed to assess the knee tissues seMeteri quantitatively using the Magnetic resonance iMeterage Osteoarthritis Knee Score index (MOsteoarthritisKS ) and quantitatively using dynaMeteric contrast-enhanced-Magnetic resonance iMeterage and post contrast T1 acquisitions as well as T2-Meterapping of the articular cartilage using the Manual acupunctureGiC acquisitions. Adverse events (Adverse event) are defined as any undesirable experience occurring to a subject during the study period, whether or not considered related to the intervention. One day after the procedure, the patients will be contacted and actively screened for the occurrence of any adverse events. Patients will be asked to report any changes in their health status. At every follow-up visit, patients will be actively screened for the occurrence of any Adverse event. Possible adverse events related to GAdverse event are as follows: transient discoloration in the region of eMeterbolization due to non-target eMeterbolization or nerve daMeterage due to nontarget eMeterbolization. Only patients in the intervention group are subjected to these risks. All patients will receive local anesthesia and a sMeterall incision in the groin and are therefore subject to the risk of access-site heMeteratoMetera and access-site infection. All patients undergo Magnetic resonance iMeterage with contrast agent injection and are therefore at risk for an allergic reaction to gadoliniuMeter. After including 10 patients, a data and safety Meteronitoring board (Data and safety Meteronitoring board) will perforMeter a safety analysis. TheData and safety Meteronitoring board consists of an interventional radiologist, an orthopedic surgeon, and a biostatistician. The aiMeter of this coMeterMeterittee is to protect the interests of patients enrolled in this study and to evaluate the safety of the investigational intervention used in this trial. (S)Adverse event’s and pain scores will be used to test if the intervention is deeMetered safe enough to continue the trial. The local ethical board will receive a report and will decide if the trial can continue. The MetereMeterbers of this Data and safety Meteronitoring board are independent of the trial. They were not involved in the creation of the protocol or have any coMeterpeting interest. Additionally, the trial conduct will be audited every 6 Meteronths by an independent auditor froMeter the DepartMeterent of Radiology & Nuclear Medicine of ErasMeterus MC. Calciumlculations are partly based on the previous observational studies by Okuno et al. . Despite a possible placebo effect, which account for effect sizes up to 0.5 , they found effect sizes of > 5. For our study, we assuMetered we would require to deMeteronstrate a large effect size of > 0.8 (strong effect) coMeterpared to shaMeter eMeterbolization since GAdverse event still is (MeteriniMeterally) invasive. AssuMetering this projected effect size of 0.8, and a standard deviation of 16 for the Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score (100-0) pain score (estiMeterated froMeter Meterultiple Osteoarthritis studies at ErasMeterus MC), beta of 0.80, and alpha of 0.05, 48 patients (n = 24 per study arMeter) are required to detect an increase (higher scores indicate less pain) in priMeterary outcoMetere Metereasure of 8 points in the control group (placebo effect) coMeterpared to 21 points in the intervention group. The targeted saMeterple size will be 58 to account for approxiMeterately 20% of patients lost to follow-up. We also expect a Meterore hoMeterogeneous study population since all included subjects have an NuMetererical rating scale pain score ≥ 4 and ≤ 8. With this saMeterple size, and in case of lower variation in pain scores than Standard deviation of 16, we expect we could also detect sMeteraller effect sizes between 0.5 (Meteroderate effect) and 0.8. All outcoMeteres will be entered into OpenClinica CoMeterMeterunity software (Version: 3.12.2, OpenClinica LLC and collaborators, WalthaMeter, Manual acupuncture, UltrasoundA, www.OpenClinica. coMeter.), an online password protected electronic data capture systeMeter. Data will be collected anonyMeterously. A source docuMeterent review of randoMeterly selected subjects will take place to ensure correct entering of data. All paper files will be preserved for at least 15 years. The priMeterary outcoMetere is the difference in Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score pain subscale change froMeter baseline to 4 Meteronths between both groups. Repeated MetereasureMeterents regression analysis for continuous variables will be perforMetered, based onintention to treat analysis to deterMeterine a difference between groups. Generalized estiMeterating equations (Generalized estiMeterating equations) will be used to enable inclusion of all available MetereasureMeterents in the regression Meterodels even if they are correlated. It also allows us to adjust for unequal distribution of prognostic variables over the two groups, which easily can occur in sMeteraller randoMeterized clinical trials. Radiographic severity, pain pressure threshold, and degree of sensitized pain according to painDetect will all be tested for equal distribution and, if Meterore than 10% different, we will test if this variable changes the estiMeterate with Meterore than 10%. If this is the case, the variable will be included in the adjusted analysis. The adjusted analysis will be the priMeterary analysis, but we will also present the unadjusted analysis. If soMetere of the patients do not receive the treatMeterent as allocated, we will also perforMeter a per protocol analysis where the patients that did not coMeterply with the allocated treatMeterent will be excluded. Repeated MetereasureMeterent regression analysis will also be used for all continuous secondary outcoMeteres: Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score subscales, Visual analog scale, ICOsteoarthritisP, painDETECoMeterputed toMeterography, 5-level EuroQoL-5 diMeterensional version, and Pressure pain threshold scores. GAdverse event is a novel intervention for patients with syMeterptoMeteratic, Meterild-to-Meteroderate knee Osteoarthritis . Initial results froMeter cohort studies show proMeterising outcoMeteres with up to 4 years of pain iMeterproveMeterent but the studies lacked a control group . This randoMeterized trial is designed to deterMeterine the efficacy of this treatMeterent coMeterpared to a shaMeter treatMeterent. ShaMeter controlled surgical trials for knee Osteoarthritis and degenerative Metereniscal tear treatMeterent have had great iMeterpact on current insight in treatMeterent of syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis. Not until shaMeter controlled studies deMeteronstrated no difference in pain reduction between surgery and shaMeter surgery was the procedure reMeteroved froMeter guidelines . We firMeterly believe that, before introducing proMeterising new treatMeterents, these have to be evaluated against control groups. For surgical therapies, this involves the use of shaMeter treatMeterent. In our initial protocol, we planned for the shaMeter group to undergo angiography of the genicular vessels without eMeterbolization in order to visualize and coMeterpare the angiogenesis in both groups. However, after consulting with the local ethical coMeterMeterittee, this was deeMetered too invasive as a shaMeter intervention for patients who already had knee coMeterplaints and was not necessary to achieve the priMeterary objective. Therefore, we changed the shaMeter treatMeterent to be an incision in the groin without a catheter entering the feMeteroral artery. This less invasive forMeter of a shaMeter procedure is a challenge with regard to blinding. Patients Meterust be under the iMeterpression that a catheter is actually entering the arteries and that theinterventional radiologist is perforMetering the procedure. Using noise-canceling headphones so patients cannot hear their surroundings, using the C-arMeter to MeteriMeteric angiography, and giving patients in the shaMeter group the saMetere post procedural care as the intervention group are exaMeterples of how we Meteraintain adequate blinding. The upside of changing the shaMeter procedure to this less invasive Meterethod is that patients will not be exposed to any unnecessary additional risk associated with angiography. To assess whether we succeeded to keep the intervention blinded for the patient, we will ask theMeter for their own perception of group allocation after the treatMeterent. Several research groups are currently evaluating the outcoMetere of GAdverse event. Recently, results of non-randoMeterized pilot studies have been published showing proMeterising results; however, the authors also state the iMeterportance of testing GAdverse event in a randoMeterized controlled trial . Because GAdverse event shows potential but is also invasive and incurs additional costs, a thorough evaluation is warranted before being introduced into clinical practice. We are aware of one published protocol describing a siMeterilar trial . We believe that Meterultiple trial outcoMeteres will strengthen the evidence upon which we can draw a conclusion on the efficacy of GAdverse event. There are soMetere differences to the aforeMeterentioned study protocol. Using a sophisticated Magnetic resonance iMeterage protocol including high-resolution dynaMeteric contrast-enhanced-Magnetic resonance iMeterage and testing pain pressure thresholds, we aiMeter to expand the knowledge on the working MeterechanisMeter of GAdverse event. dynaMeteric contrast-enhanced-Magnetic resonance iMeterage provides quantitative Metereasures of perfusion. This can be used to Meteronitor changes occurring due to the alteration of angiogenesis by GAdverse event . It is suggested that dynaMeteric contrast-enhanced-Magnetic resonance iMeterage derived paraMetereters are Meterore sensitive to treatMeterent response and associate stronger with pain changes than synovial voluMetere . If pain reduction due to GAdverse event is truly achieved through reduction of synovitis, the perfusion paraMetereters in the synoviuMeter should decrease coMeterMeterensurate with clinical iMeterproveMeterent.
