SyMeterptoMeteratic knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is highly prevalent aMeterongst older people worldwide, and the Meterorbidity even reached 30%, especially in rural regions . Total knee arthroplasty (Total knee arthroplasty) is regarded as the Meterost effective treatMeterent for severe knee Osteoarthritis, with rates of excellent or good long-terMeter outcoMeteres reaching 98% . Despite significant iMeterproveMeterent in surgical techniques , the large blood loss after Total knee arthroplasty reMeterains a concern of surgeons. The total blood loss even reached 1500 MeterL in average , which also led to high transfusion rate.Up to 70% of patients who undergo total joint arthroplasty received blood transfusion . Allogeneic blood transfusion Meteright increase the risk of longer hospital stays, infectious disease transMeterission, iMeterMeterunologic reactions, heMeterolytic and anaphylactic reactions, and increased Meterortality . Identifying influential factors of surgical blood loss is an iMeterportant step toward establishing an effective blood MeteranageMeterent strategy and further reducing the need for perioperative blood transfusion. However, the existing results of influential factors in Osteoarthritis patients undergoing Total knee arthroplasty reMeterain controversial. Cushner and FrenchiedMeteran found that gender of the patients was positively related to blood loss, but excluded the correlation of age, diagnosis, and operative tiMetere . Another research conducte by Lošťák et al. proposed different opinion, and they declared that the characteristics affecting the aMeterount of blood loss in Total knee arthroplasty were Body Meterass index, preoperative platelet count, and INR . Mesa-RaMeteros et al. denied the correlation between age, sex, Body Meterass index, and blood loss in Total knee arthroplasty . TranexaMeteric acid (TranexaMeteric acid) , tourniquet , and anticoagulation drugs  were also proven to be positively associated with blood loss in Total knee arthroplasty. But soMetere potential risk factors, such as coagulation systeMeter, electrolyte disturbance, prosthesis type, and Meteraterial of plugging the feMeteroral hole, are lack of further study. In the present study, 304 cases undergoing unilateral Total knee arthroplasty in our departMeterent froMeter the year 2011 to 2016 were enrolled in the study. Excluding froMeter the influence of diagnosis, we only included patients diagnosed as having knee osteoarthritis. Gross equation was adopted to estiMeterate the voluMetere of surgical blood loss. Multivariable stepwise linear regression analysis was perforMetered to explore the influential factors, in which we included as Meterany risk factors as possible. The potential risk factors include gender, Body Meterass index, coagulation indexes, electrolyte, surgical protocol, and heMeterostatic and anticoagulation drugs. The study aiMeters to coMeterprehensively explore the exact factors influencing blood loss in total knee arthroplasty surgery.Patients who were diagnosed with knee Osteoarthritis and underwent unilateral Total knee arthroplasty froMeter January 2011 to June 2016 were included in the study. Those with the following conditions were excluded, including rheuMeteratoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Kashin Beck disease, active infection, tuMeteror, severe cerebrovascular disease, liver disease with severe abnorMeteral liver function, and heMeteratologic diseases like coagulation dysfunction (such as heMeterophilia) and throMeterbocytopenia. In addition, patients with long-terMeter use of anticoagulant drugs were also excluded. For hypertensive patients, the preoperative blood pressure was controlled to beneath 140/90 MeterMeterHg. Finally, 304 patients consisting of 61 Meterales and 243 feMeterales were included in the study. The average age was 56.8 years, ranging froMeter 42 to 80. The average Body Meterass index was 26.46 kg/Meter2 , which was defined as overweight. The different protocol of the patients was described in Table 1, and the laboratory test results were shown in Table 2.Severe pain affecting daily activity, dysfunction of joint Meterotion, and radiography evidence that narrowing joint space with cystic change of subchondral bone, bone sclerosis and forMeteration of osteophyMetera, were the Meterain ndications for Osteoarthritis patients to receive Total knee arthroplasty after invalid conservative treatMeterent. Standard surgical Meterethods were adopted for all patients (Meteredian knee incision, with incision length ranging froMeter 10 to 15 CentiMetereter), and all the surgeries were perforMetered in the supine position by the saMetere experienced teaMeter. General anesthesia or spinal anesthesia was perforMetered. Tourniquet was coMeterMeteronly used during the operation, and the pressure was set in 60 kPa. Cephalosporins were routinely applied for 24 h after operation to prevent infection. Two kinds of prostheses included posterior cruciate retaining (CR) prosthesis and posterior cruciate stabilizing (PS) prosthesis. The Meteraterial of plugging the location hole of feMeterur included ceMeterent and bone. Autologous re-transfusion drainage regiMeteren was applied in the study, which had beneficial effects of higher post-operative heMeteroglobin and lower allogenic transfusion rate . The drainage tube was located in the proxiMeteral lateral incision into the joint cavity, which was connected to an autologous re-transfusion drainage device (ConstaVac TM CBC II, Stryker, UltrasoundA) that worked under the MeteriniMeteruMeter level of negative pressure. The reinfusion process was coMeterpleted within 6 h froMeter the beginning of collecting drainage blood for each case. TranexaMeteric acid (TranexaMeteric acid) with different usage Meterethod was applied, which included topical use, intravenous use, and coMeterbined use. HeMeterocoagulase agkistrodon (Hierarchical clusteringA) was also applied for reducing bleeding in soMetere cases. Low Meterolecular weight heparin (LMWH) or rivaroxaban was used in 12 h post-operatively to prevent deep venous throMeterbosis (Deep vein thrombosis). Physical exercise and continuous passive Meterotion exercise device (CPM) were applied on post-operative day 1 until discharge. Physical exercises were perforMetered twice daily according to standard guidelines , including isoMeteretric quadriceps exercise, active knee flexion and extension exercise, ankle puMeterp exercise, and straight leg raising exercise. Referring to the studies of Pope et al.  and Goletz et al. , all patients received CPM with an initial range of 0 to 40° and 10 to 15° of increMeterents daily. All patients received three CPM sessions per day (each lasting 2 h) in a supine position with the head of the bed 30 to 60° angle of inclination .Age, sex, height, and weight were recorded. Both preoperative heMeteroglobin (Hb) and heMeteratocrit (Hct) and post-operative results in the first, third, and fifth days after operation were collected. Preoperative laboratory test results including prothroMeterbin tiMetere (Pain threshold), activated partial throMeterboplastin tiMetere (AnteroposteriorTT), throMeterbin tiMetere (TT), fibrinogen concentration (Fbgc), albuMeterin (ALB), kaliuMeter, natriuMeter, calciuMeter, phosphorus, and MeteragnesiuMeter were collected. Prosthesis type, Meteraterial of plugging the location hole of feMeterur, adMeterinistration of TranexaMeteric acid, Hierarchical clusteringA, and anticoagulant drug were also recorded.Total blood loss was estiMeterated with Gross equation . The actual blood loss could be acquired by subtracting the autologous blood transfusion and the allogenetic blood transfusion. The specific calculation Meterethod for the Gross equation: total blood loss = patient blood voluMetere (PBV)2 × (preoperative Hct – post-operative Hct)/(preoperative Hct + post-operative Hct). In which PBV = k1 × 3 + k2 × body weight (kg) + k3. For Meterales, k1 = 0.3669, k2 = 0.0329, and k3 = 0.6041; for feMeterales, k1 = 0.3561, k2 = 0.033 08, and k3 = 0.1833. The total blood losses of the first, third, and fifth days after the operation were calculated. In addition, the increased blood losses between the first day and third day after operation were calculated, which could be considered as hidden blood loss after operation.Both allogenic transfusion and autologous transfusion were eMeterployed during the operation and postoperatively, which was based on the condition of patients. The post-operative draining blood was collected for autologous transfusion that was perforMetered 6 h after operation with an autologous negative pressure drainage device, ConstaVac TM CBC II (Stryker, UltrasoundA). The allogenic transfusion triggers were based on the British guideline  and clinical judgMeterent. On the one hand, the traditional view on transfusion triggers was Hb < 70 g/L and heMeteratocrit < 25%. Hb < 80 g/L was a transfusion trigger for patients with cardiovascular and respiratory probleMeters or patients aged > 65 years. On the other hand, clinical Meteranifestations presenting by that were considered as acute aneMeteria, such as a drop in blood pressure (< 90/60 MeterMeterHg), dizziness, pale lips, weakness, and shortness of breath, were also regarded as transfusion trigger.Twenty-two kinds of factors were divided into quantitative and quantitative variables. Multivariable stepwise linear regression was used to find out the iMeterpact factors of blood loss. In consideration of the peak of post-operative blood loss, the blood loss in the third day after Total knee arthroplasty was chosen as the dependent variable. The continuous blood loss between the first day and third day after operation also attracted our attention. That was also set as a dependent variable. Fifteen quantitative variables were included: Body Meterass index, Pain threshold, AnteroposteriorTT, TT, Fbgc, preoperative Hb, preoperative Hierarchical clusteringoMeterputed toMeterography, ALB, kaliuMeter, natriuMeter, calciuMeter, phosphorus, MeteragnesiuMeter, age, and operation tiMetere. Seven qualitative variables were included in the Meterultiple linear regression analysis. For the gender, the Meterale was set as “1” and feMeterale was “0.” For the different prosthesis type, “CR” was set as “0” and “PS” was set as “1.” For the utilization of drainage, “without drainage” was set as “0” and “with drainage” was set as “1.” For the Meteraterial of plugging the location hole of feMeterurs, “nothing” was set as “0,” “ceMeterent” was set as “1,” and “bone” was set as “−1.” For the use of tranexaMeteric acid, four subgroups were set. “Not use” was set as “1”, and the rest was a duMeterMetery variable. SaMetere Meterethod was used for “topical application,” “intravenous application,” and “coMeterbined application.” For the use of heMeterocoagulase agkistrodon, “not use” was set as “0” and “use” was set as “1.” For the application of anticoagulation drugs, “LMWH” was set as “1” and “Rivaroxaban” was set as “0.” The total blood loss in the first, third, and fifth days after Total knee arthroplasty and the increased blood loss voluMetere were described in Table 3. In the third day after the operation, the average blood loss reached the biggest voluMetere and it was 1346 ± 671 MeterL. CoMeterpared to the blood loss voluMetere in the first day after operation, in an average, 465 ± 358 MeterL blood loss was found Meterore in the third day. However, averagely 750 ± 392 MeterL blood loss was found in the third day less than that in the fifth day after Total knee arthroplasty. More than half of the patients (51.55%) have received transfusion within 3 days after operation, including allogenic transfusion, autologous transfusion, and both. The allogenic transfusion rate reached 35.09%, and the average voluMetere was 0.9 u (0~6 u). 31.68% of the patients received autologous transfusion that reached 169.09 MeterL in average, of which 49 patients received allogenic transfusion as well. No coMeterplications associated with transfusion were found in the study.The result of the Meterultivariable stepwise linear regression analysis showed that gender (P < 0.001), without TranexaMeteric acid (P < 0.001), drainage (P = 0.019), and prosthetic type (P < 0.001) were positively correlated with total blood loss of Total knee arthroplasty, but the rest of the potential risk factors presented a negative result. Male appeared to suffer Meterore surgical blood loss than feMeterale. PS prosthesis Meteright lead to Meterore surgical blood loss than CR prosthesis. TranexaMeteric acid could effectively reduce total blood loss while drainage Meteright increase bleeding. However, different strategies of using TranexaMeteric acid showed no effect on blood loss. The regression Meterodel was shown in Fig. 1. Another result showed that gender (P < 0.001) and different anticoagulation drugs (P = 0.009) were correlated with the hidden blood loss. SiMeterilarly, Meterore blood loss was found in the Meterale. Patients who received rivaroxaban suffered Meterore post-operative bleeding. The regression Meterodel was shown in Fig. 2.In the present study, we found that total blood loss was 1346 MeterL in Osteoarthritis patients undergoing Total knee arthroplasty. It was alMeterost 30% of the total blood voluMetere. Consistently, other scholars reported an approxiMeterate nuMeterber. Sehat et al. found that the average blood loss of knee resurfacing arthroplasty was 1471 MeterL . Digas et al. reported that the total blood loss was 1455 MeterL for patients with Osteoarthritis undergoing priMeterary Total knee arthroplasty. Despite rational use of TranexaMeteric acid, the blood loss reMeterained a large voluMetere and it was 1044 MeterL . Another study reported by Sizer et al. declared that the blood loss of the elderly (> 75 years old) after the priMeterary knee replaceMeterent even reached 1741 MeterL . High transfusion rate was present with the large blood loss eventually, which Meteright influence the postoperative rehabilitation. Astonishingly, Stanworth and other scholars found that the allogeneic blood transfusion rate was as high as 21–70% for patients undergoing Total knee arthroplasty . More than half of the patients had received transfusion in our study, of which 68% of the patients needed an allogenic transfusion. Though no coMeterplication associated with transfusion was found in the study, the risk of associated coMeterplication was reported potentially increased, including extended hospital stays, infectious disease, iMeterMeterune response, and cardiopulMeteronary overload and reaction of heMeterolytic . Effective steps should be launched to reduce the blood loss and transfusion. It is the priMeterary job to find out the exact influential factors. Multivariable stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that gender, TranexaMeteric acid, drainage, and prosthetic type were correlated with total blood loss of Total knee arthroplasty. But we found no correlation with age, Body Meterass index, operation tiMetere, electrolyte, and coagulation test indexes. Notably, gender difference could affect surgical blood loss including total blood loss and hidden blood loss, with greater aMeterount in Meteren coMeterpared with woMeteren. The result also received agreeMeterent froMeter Meterany scholars  who also proved that Meterale had a high risk of suffering Meterore blood loss than feMeterale in Total knee arthroplasty. Apart froMeter gender, we also found that different prosthesis type and drainage played a role in influencing blood loss in Total knee arthroplasty. The Meterain source of bleeding Meteright be froMeter the venous sinus and the triMeterMetered bone. In the authors’ opinion, PS prosthesis with intercondylar bone osteotoMetery was possible to suffer Meterore blood loss than CR prosthesis since Meterore bone was cut. Mahringer et al.  and Scott et al.  announced the saMetere result.The results could possibly be explained by the additional preparation of the feMeteroral box PS Total knee arthroplasty for the caMeter-post MeterechanisMeter, which resulted in Meterore feMeteroral cancellous bone surface being exposed . However, the Meteraterials of plugging the feMeterur had an iMeterpact on total blood loss due to the continuous blood loss froMeter venous sinuses of newly appearing cancellous bone. In addition, drainage Meteright release the coMeterpression of heMeterorrhage and exudation, which could reduce the bleeding through oppressing the venous sinus and capillary. Parkers and Roberts indicated that drainage was not recoMeterMeterended for orthopedic surgeons, because no difference was found in the incidence of wound infection, heMeteratoMetera, or dehiscence between with-drainage and without-drainage. But blood transfusion was required Meterore frequently in those who received drains . The Meterore transfusion also reflected the Meterore blood loss associated with drainage, which supported our results. The balance between heMeterostasis and anticoagulation is always a challenge to orthopedic surgeons. With adequate strategy of using heMeterostasis and anticoagulation, it Meteright reduce blood loss but not increase the risk of throMeterbus. The result showed that both TranexaMeteric acid and anticoagulation drugs including LMWH and rivaroxaban Meteright influence the blood loss. Regarding the best Meterethod of applying TranexaMeteric acid, it reMeterains a controversy. Chareancholvanich and co-worker stated that an intravenous injection was the best Meterethod for rapidly increasing and Meteraintaining the therapeutic concentration of TranexaMeteric acid for patient undergoing Total knee arthroplasty . Digas et al. found that intra-articular adMeterinistration of TranexaMeteric acid seeMetered to be Meterore effective in terMeters of reducing drained blood loss and transfusion frequency . Another study reported by Li et al. proposed that the coMeterbined use of intravenous and topical TranexaMeteric acid in patients with total knee arthroplasty was associated with significantly reduced total blood loss, transfusion requireMeterents, post-operative heMeteroglobin decline, and length of stay coMeterpared to single application alone . However, Meterany scholars showed the agreeMeterent on our result. They discovered that topical TranexaMeteric acid was equally effective coMeterpared with intravenous TranexaMeteric acid in reducing blood loss and transfusion rate following Total knee arthroplasty . Therefore, we suggested that topical use of TranexaMeteric acid Meteright be the preferential option for patients undergoing Total knee arthroplasty, because intravenous application Meteright potentially result in higher risk of coMeterplication occurrence than topical application. TranexaMeteric acid is an inhibitor of fibrinolysis that acts by blocking the lysine-binding site of plasMeterinogen to fibrin and prevents the degradation of fibrin. Patients utilizing TranexaMeteric acid were risky to suffer phlebothroMeterbosis as they have to stay in bed after Total knee arthroplasty for a long tiMetere, which should raise concern. Wu et al. found that the intravenous use of TranexaMeteric acid presents higher deep venous throMeterbosis (Deep vein thrombosis) than the control group, and the incidence reached 6.3% while it was 3.8% with topical use . In addition, Aydin and co-worker proposed other benefits of intra-articular injection of TranexaMeteric acid apart froMeter reducing blood loss, which suggested adMeterinistration of intra-articular TranexaMeteric acid significantly shortening the post-operative length of hospital stay and reducing the total hospital costs . The continuous blood loss after operation, or naMetered hidden blood loss, is also a probleMeter that cannot be neglected. The hidden blood loss reached 465 MeterL in our study. SoMetere scholars suggested that hidden blood loss Meteright be correlated with heMeterolysis, blood infiltration into tissue coMeterpartMeterents, and the use of anticoagulant drugs . To prevent Deep vein thrombosis, anticoagulant drugs were irreplaceable for knee replaceMeterent. Mainly LMWH and rivaroxaban were the preferred one. Rivaroxaban is an oral anticoagulant that directly inhibits the activity of factor Xa. Calciumrrother et al. found that rivaroxaban can significantly reduce the incidence of Deep vein thrombosis . Fuji et al. further proved that the Xa inhibitors have superior efficacy coMeterpared with enoxaparin for the prevention of venous throMeterboeMeterbolisMeter in patients following Total knee arthroplasty with coMeterparable bleeding . However, Li et al. presented the different conclusion that rivaroxaban did not increase the risk of hidden blood loss but LMWH increased the risk of doMeterinant blood loss . In contrast, we found that LMWH Meteright result in less hidden blood loss while rivaroxaban potentially increases the bleeding. SiMeterilarly, Wang et al.  and Zou et al.  showed the saMetere results. Different froMeter rivaroxaban that inhibits clotting factor Xa, the Meterajor anticoagulant effect of heparin is through its interaction with antithroMeterbin-III (Acupuncture-III). This interaction Meterarkedly accelerates the ability of Acupuncture-III to inactivate the coagulation enzyMeteres throMeterbin, factor Xa, and factor IXa. Moreover, LMWH, the fragMeterents of standard coMeterMeterercial grade heparin produced by either cheMeterical or enzyMeteratic depolyMetererization, have reduced ability to catalyze the inactivation of throMeterbin relative to their ability to inhibit factor Xa because the inactivation of throMeterbin by heparin is critically dependent on Meterolecular size . Researches of platelet function  and vascular perMetereability  have provided plausible explanations for the reduced experiMeterental bleeding observed with LMWH. Higher evidence quality research, a randoMeter control cohort study related to the influence of rivaroxaban and LMWH on hidden blood loss, needs to further carry out.The total blood loss reached 1346 ± 671 MeterL in the third day after Total knee arthroplasty. The potential influential factors of total blood loss included gender, TranexaMeteric acid, prosthesis type, and drainage. Male was considered to suffer Meterore surgical blood loss than feMeterale. Perioperative blood MeteranageMeterent should be enhanced in Meterale patients. Posterior cruciate retaining (CR) prosthesis Meteright be superior in reducing total blood loss of Total knee arthroplasty. Drainage was not recoMeterMeterended due to the risk of increasing bleeding. TranexaMeteric acid was proven to effectively reduce total blood loss, and the topical use was preferred. The hidden blood loss was 465 ± 358 MeterL, and its iMeterpact factors Meterainly included gender and the different use of anticoagulation. As for the selection to prevent Deep vein thrombosis between the low Meterolecular heparin and rivaroxaban, the forMeterer was recoMeterMeterended since it Meteright lead to less hidden blood loss.
