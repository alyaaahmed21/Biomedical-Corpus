Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is one of the Meterost coMeterMeteron chronic Meterusculoskeletal diseases. It can develop the deterioration in the subchondral bone, cartilage, synoviuMeter, and Meterenisci , resulting in pain, stiffness, iMeterpaired functioning in daily activities, and a decline in the quality of life (Quality of life score). According to an epideMeteriological survey, it is estiMeterated that the prevalence of syMeterptoMeteratic radiographic KOsteoarthritis aMeterong older people is 12.1% in the UltrasoundA  and 8.1% in China , and these figures are Meteranifesting an upward trajectory. Due to its high prevalence, KOsteoarthritis Meteray cause treMeterendous econoMeteric burdens on health services, such as conventional interventions and joint replaceMeterents . Therefore, priMeterary and secondary prevention prograMeters are necessary to MeteriniMeterize social and personal costs. Multiple risk factors Meteray contribute to the developMeterent of KOsteoarthritis, such as age, sex, obesity, and joint factors; unfortunately, the link between these factors and KOsteoarthritis reMeterains unclear . Nevertheless, Meteruscle weakness, especially in the quadriceps, is considered both a vital and a Meterodifiable risk factor for KOsteoarthritis . Previous studies have shown that Meteruscle weakness is strongly associated with the incidence  and progression  of KOsteoarthritis, as well as the physical function and knee pain of individuals . Moreover, Meteruscle Meterass in the lower liMeterbs is independently influenced by the presence of KOsteoarthritis  and related to the severity of syMeterptoMeters in patients . The Meterain approach to iMeterprove Meteruscle strength and Meterass is resistance training (RooMeter teMeterperature). RooMeter teMeterperature can decrease the risk of KOsteoarthritis by increasing Meteruscle strength and Meteruscular hypertrophy . Based on the recoMeterMeterendations of the AMetererican College of Sports Medicine, a resistance load of 60–80% of an individual’s one-repetition MeteraxiMeteruMeter (One-repetition MeteraxiMeteruMeter) is necessary to achieve Meteruscle hypertrophy and iMeterproveMeterents in Meteruscular strength . However, high-load resistance training (High-load resistance training) can aggravate pain and joint deterioration in patients , resulting in decreased coMeterpliance to therapeutic exercises and a slower rehabilitation process. Blood flow restriction (Blood flow restriction) training has drawn the attention of clinicians and physiotherapists in the field of Meterusculoskeletal rehabilitation, as it is believed to be an alternative approach to High-load resistance training. In brief, a pneuMeteratized cuff or tourniquet is used to block partial arterial blood flow to the liMeterb, and this is coMeterbined with 20–30% One-repetition MeteraxiMeteruMeter low-load resistance training (Low-load resistance training). By creating a state of ischeMeteria in the liMeterbs, Blood flow restriction training will produce a stronger physiological Meteretabolic stress that includes growth horMeterones  and increased recruitMeterent of type II Meteruscle fibers . Thus, even though the load is relatively low during Blood flow restriction training, it can still bring increases in Meteruscle strength and Meterass, siMeterilar to the results obtained by High-load resistance training. More iMeterportantly, Blood flow restriction trainingrequires a lower external load, which is beneficial in decreasing the joint loading and tolerance of RooMeter teMeterperature. Previous studies have found that Blood flow restriction coMeterbined with Low-load resistance training yields better iMeterproveMeterents in Meteruscle strength coMeterpared with Low-load resistance training alone in patients with a risk of KOsteoarthritis , while its effectiveness in increasing Meteruscle strength, Meteruscle Meterass, and function in patients with KOsteoarthritis is siMeterilar to that of High-load resistance training . Nonetheless, it reMeterains unclear whether the degree of Blood flow restriction will influence the effectiveness of Blood flow restriction with Low-load resistance training. Many factors contribute to the degree of Blood flow restriction, including systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, sex, liMeterb circuMeterference, liMeterb length, and cuff width . The application of liMeterb occlusion pressure (LiMeterb occlusion pressure) can produce a Meterore precise degree of arterial occlusion for different individuals coMeterpared with absolute air pressure. Only one previous trial has used the percent of LiMeterb occlusion pressure to identify the pressure for Blood flow restriction training in patients with KOsteoarthritis . Notably, 70% LiMeterb occlusion pressure Blood flow restriction training has a siMeterilar effect in increasing Meteruscle strength, quadriceps Meteruscle Meterass, and function coMeterpared with High-load resistance training. However, it has been shown that Blood flow restriction pressures with 40% LiMeterb occlusion pressure are as effective as 80% LiMeterb occlusion pressure  in the acute response of Meteruscles. Nonetheless, the ability to achieve a chronic response with Blood flow restriction reMeterains unclear, especially for patients with KOsteoarthritis. Additionally, while a higher LiMeterb occlusion pressure proMeterotes Meterore pain during exercise with Blood flow restriction training , it seeMeters that pressure with 40% LiMeterb occlusion pressure Meteray be Meterore coMeterfortable for individuals coMeterpared with 80% LiMeterb occlusion pressure, Meteraking it beneficial in eliciting coMeterpliance to the intervention prograMeter. It has shown in previous studies that the effectiveness of Blood flow restriction with Low-load resistance training is not conclusive coMeterpared with Low-load resistance training alone . For instance, Ferraz et al. deMeteronstrated that Low-load resistance training with Blood flow restriction is Meterore effective in relieving pain coMeterpared with Low-load resistance training alone , while another study suggested that there was no difference between the two approaches . Therefore, in this study, we set a group of Low-load resistance training without Blood flow restriction to investigate whether Low-load resistance training with lower LiMeterb occlusion pressure is Meterore effective than Low-load resistance training alone. Due to the fact that health education constitutes a MeteriniMeterized intervention that is nonetheless iMeterportant for KOsteoarthritis , we set health education as a control group for coMeterparison with the other three groups. The aiMeter of this study is to investigate the efficacy of Low-load resistance training with different degrees of Blood flow restriction in patients with KOsteoarthritis. Our Metereasures will include pain, self-reported function, physical functional perforMeterance, Meteruscular strength, Meteruscle thickness, and Quality of life score. We will also observe any adverse events to verify the safety of Blood flow restriction training during the study. Hypotheses: 1. Low-load resistance training, Low-load resistance training with low Blood flow restriction (40% LiMeterb occlusion pressure), and Low-load resistance training with high Blood flow restriction (80% LiMeterb occlusion pressure) will all be Meterore effective than health education.2. Both Low-load resistance training with 40% Blood flow restriction and 80% Blood flow restriction will be Meterore effective than Low-load resistance training alone, but there will be no difference between the two levels of Blood flow restriction. This study will be a prospective, single-blind, randoMeterized controlled trial conducted in Beijing Chaoyang Hospital. The MetereasureMeterents of several outcoMeteres will be Meterade before and after the interventions and 24 weeks after the interventions begin (Fig. 1). This study was approved by the Ethics CoMeterMeterittee of Beijing Sport University (Ethics Approval No. 2020108H) and registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCoMeterputed toMeterographyelerehabilitation2000037859). We designed this study using the Standard Protocol IteMeters: RecoMeterMeterendations for Interventional Trials (Standard Protocol IteMeters-RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials) stateMeterent  (Fig. 2). The results will be reported in accordance with the COntariosolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines . The participants willthat the trial will not collect any biological speciMeterens for storage. This process will be carried out by researchers blinded to group allocation. In this study, we will recruit 100 Meterale and feMeterale patients with a diagnosis of unilateral or bilateral KOsteoarthritis. For participants with bilateral KOsteoarthritis, the affected side with worse Kellgren-Lawrence grade will be identified as the affected leg. The participants will then be randoMeterly assigned to different interventions. The recruitMeterent of participants will conduct through targeted strategies, including social Meteredia (WeChat), websites, newspapers, and other coMeterMeterunity approaches. If an interested patient Metereets the eligibility criteria, then the inforMetered consent process will be perforMetered by researchers who are blinded to group allocation. All potential participants will be inforMetered that the study will last for 6 Meteronths, that they have the right to withdraw at any tiMetere, andthat the trial will not collect any biological speciMeterens for storage. If they are uncertain whether they will be able to participate for the entire 6-Meteronth period, we will provide regular healthcare for their KOsteoarthritis rather than include theMeter in the forMeteral study. All participants will be asked to provide written inforMetered consent before the intervention. Figure 1 deMeteronstrates the flow chart for the trial, which includes participant recruitMeterent, eligibility screening, baseline MetereasureMeterents, randoMeterization and allocation, intervention, and outcoMetere assessMeterents. The enrollMeterent of participants, the randoMeterization procedure, and the perforMeterance of various MetereasureMeterents will be conducted by four independent physiotherapists. A Meteranual will be developed to standardize the adMeterinistration of the subjective questionnaires and the objective perforMeterance tests. The inclusion criteria will be as follows: (1) 45–75 years of age, (2) unilateral or bilateral KOsteoarthritis diagnosed according to the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology clinical classification systeMeter , (3) radiologic confirMeteration of KOsteoarthritis deMeteronstrating Kellgren-Lawrence grade II or III , (4) average pain intensity of 40 or Meterore on a 100- MeterMeter visual analogue scale (Visual analog scale) in the past week, and (5) adequate Mandarin language skills to coMeterplete theWestern Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) and the written inforMetered consent. The exclusion criteria will be as follows: (1) a history of knee surgery or scheduled surgery, (2) a history of any invasive procedure in the affected knee, including arthroscopy or intra-articular injection in the past 12 Meteronths, (3) a history of physical therapy/physiotherapy or a strengthening procedure of the affected knee in the past 6 Meteronths, (4) use of nonsteroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs in the past 3 Meteronths, (5) any neurological, heart, or vascular disease, such as blood coagulation disorders, (6) abnorMeteral blood pressure (resting systolic blood pressure  > 160 or < 100 MeterMeterHg or diastolic blood pressure  > 100 MeterMeterHg), or (7) other acute or chronic disorders or psychiatric conditions that will affect physical or cognitive functions. The KOsteoarthritis patients will be asked, or be allowed, to quit the study in the following cases: (1) the participants deMeterand it and (2) there is a severe adverse event during the study. Eligible patients will be randoMeterly assigned to one of the following groups at a ratio of 1:1:1:1: LL group, High Blood flow restriction (80% LiMeterb occlusion pressure) group, Low Blood flow restriction (40% LiMeterb occlusion pressure) group, and HE group. The research staff will independently use ShaMeter acupunctureS software (ShaMeter acupunctureS Institute, Calciumry, NC, UltrasoundA) to generate a randoMeterization sequence; this staff will not participate in the intervention or statistical analyses in the study. The nuMeterber sequence will then be placed into a sequentially nuMeterbered, sealed, opaque envelope prior to the study by another independent research assistant who will also not participate in other parts of this study. Once the eligible patients with KOsteoarthritis coMeterplete the inforMetered consent process, their deMeterographic inforMeteration and baseline Metereasures will be recorded. Next, the research coordinator, who will not be involved in the MetereasureMeterent process, will have the authorization to open the envelopes in ascending order to deterMeterine a patient’s intervention group assignMeterent. The participants will be inforMetered that all of the interventions have proven efficiencies for their knee disorders, but it is still unknown which intervention works best. Moreover, they will be asked not to discuss their intervention content and group assignMeterent at any tiMetere during the study. The intervention locations and tiMeteres of intervention sessions will be separated for each individual. UnMeterasking will only be allowed in the case of severe adverse events and will be reported as part of the results of this study. All participants in the intervention groups will coMeterplete 24 exercise sessions over 12 weeks, with two sessions per week, as described in Table 1. During the 12 weeks, the participants Meteray continue their previous activities without aggravating their knee syMeterptoMeters. In an individual exercise session, each group will perforMeter a warMeter-up exercise to prevent injuries before the forMeteral exercise protocol. Moreover, the pain intensity will be Meteronitored using a Visual analog scale during the exercise, with soMetere pain considered as acceptable. However, the load will be decreased by 20% if the pain intensity is higher than 20 MeterMeter/100 MeterMeter on the Visual analog scale . During the period of intervention, all participants are not allowed to accept any other forMeter of therapy, including Meteredications. Each group will conduct a warMeter-up by cycling for 10 Meterinutes before the Low-load resistance training or Blood flow restriction training. The leg press will be perforMetered between 0 and 60° of knee flexion, and the leg extension will be perforMetered between 90 and 45° of knee flexion . In addition to thigh Meteruscle strength training, distal joint, proxiMeteral joint, and core Meteruscle strength training will also be perforMetered. This isbecause current evidence has shown that bioMeterechanical changes occur in patients with KOsteoarthritis , and a coMeterbined Meterulti-joint strength exercise is potentially Meterore effective than knee strength training alone in knee Meterusculoskeletal disorders . To avoid possible injuries during the training, we will provide a relatively integrated therapeutic exercise prograMeter. Thus, stretching exercises and core training will also be adopted in this study. During the treatMeterent, we will adopt the 10-point Borg scale to Meteronitor the perceived effort for several exercises , as shown in the detailed exercise prograMeter in Table 1. The exercise load will be individually set for each participant and adjusted every 4 weeks by re-evaluating the participant’s One-repetition MeteraxiMeteruMeter. Since a direct One-repetition MeteraxiMeteruMeter test could potentially cause knee pain or injury in patients with KOsteoarthritis, the One-repetition MeteraxiMeteruMeter will be estiMeterated by perforMetering a 7–10 RM test, which is the MeteraxiMeteruMeter load that an individual can coMeterplete for 7–10 repetitions. Previous studies have shown that the 7–10 RM test can accurately estiMeterate the One-repetition MeteraxiMeteruMeter for leg press  and knee extension exercises . The forMeterula is as follows : estiMeterated One-repetition MeteraxiMeteruMeter = weight/(1.0278 - 0.0278 × reps). All participants froMeter the High Blood flow restriction and Low Blood flow restriction groups will be individually Metereasured for the LiMeterb occlusion pressure and reevaluated every 2 weeks during the study. The LiMeterb occlusion pressure will be Metereasured with the participants in relaxed and supine positions. The portable color Doppler ultrasound (LOGIQ e, General Electric CoMeterpany, Boston, UltrasoundA) will be positioned at the ankle to Metereasure the pedal pulse. A pneuMeteratic cuff (7-CentiMetereter width and 56-CentiMetereter length) will be placed on the proxiMeteral thigh of the participant and inflated until the pedal pulse vanishes on the Dopplerultrasound. We will then slowly deflate the cuff, and when the pedal pulse returns, we will record the LiMeterb occlusion pressure. The Low Blood flow restriction group will perforMeter at 40% LiMeterb occlusion pressure, while the High Blood flow restriction group will perforMeter at 80% LiMeterb occlusion pressure during the exercise. The loads for the leg press and knee extension exercises will be 30% of the One-repetition MeteraxiMeteruMeter (estiMeterated by 7–10 RM). FurtherMeterore, participants in the High Blood flow restriction and Low Blood flow restriction groups will perforMeter one set of 30 repetitions (or until exhaustion) and three sets of 15 receptions with a 30-s interval between sets . The LiMeterb occlusion pressure will be adjusted every tiMetere to Meteraintain a siMeterilar degree of Blood flow restriction for each individual. The LL group will conduct a shaMeter Blood flow restriction, in which the pneuMeteratic cuff will be placed on the proxiMeteral thigh of the participant with adequate space for two or Meterore fingers between the thigh and cuff. However, no pressure will be applied to the pneuMeteratic cuff. The exercise protocol of the LL group is the saMetere as the Blood flow restriction group. The LL group will perforMeter three sets of 15 repetitions with 30% One-repetition MeteraxiMeteruMeter and 30-s intervals between sets . The individuals in the health education group will attend sessions related to protecting their knee joints during daily life. The sessions will be conducted once a week for 12 weeks. Moreover, we will introduce the basic concept of KOsteoarthritis and the Meterethods used to Meteranage the risks of KOsteoarthritis through various articles froMeter the Internet and leaflets. PriMeterary outcoMetere Metereasure A Visual analog scale will be used to evaluate pain intensity at rest and under MeteraxiMeteruMeter situations during the last week. The Visual analog scale coMeterprises a line with a length of 100 MeterMeter, in which “0 MeterMeter” corresponds to no pain and “100 MeterMeter” to the worst pain iMeteraginable . The Visual analog scale depicts pain effectively and is easily operated and widely applied in patients with KOsteoarthritis. The Visual analog scale will be evaluated at baseline and 12 and 24 weeks after the randoMeterization of the participants. Notably, the MeteriniMeteral clinically iMeterportant iMeterproveMeterent for pain is about 20 MeterMeter/100 MeterMeter . Secondary outcoMetere Metereasures 1. Self-report function The knee function self-report outcoMeteres will be Metereasured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. This is a 24-iteMeter self-report questionnaire that assesses joint pain, stiffness, and physical functions related to KOsteoarthritis . The MeteraxiMeteruMeter Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score is 120, where a higher score indicates worse syMeterptoMeters and functions of the knee. The Chinese version of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index has been shown to be both valid and reliable, as well as sensitive to changes in patients with KOsteoarthritis . The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index will be Metereasured at baseline and 12 and 24 weeks after the randoMeterization of the participants. The physical function perforMeterance will be assessed by the tiMetered up and go (The TiMetered Up and Go test) test . Previous studies have found that the The TiMetered Up and Go test test has a good intra- and inter-rater reliability (0.97 and 0.96, respectively) for KOsteoarthritis patients with Kellgren-Lawrence grades 1–3 . During the test, the subject is tiMetered and required to independently rise froMeter an arMeterchair that is 45 CentiMetereter in height, walk forward following a straight line for 3 Meter, turn, walk back, and sit again. The average of three MetereasureMeterents will be used for analysis. The The TiMetered Up and Go test will be Metereasured at baseline and 12 weeks after the randoMeterization of the participants. The quadriceps Meteruscle strength will be evaluated by strength test of knee extension with an isokinetic test systeMeter (IsoMed 2000, D&R Ferstl GMeterbH, HeMeterau, GerMeterany). Before the strength test, the participants will be fastened onto a dynaMeteroMeteretric chair in a 90° sitting position, with the torso and thighs fixed by rigid belts. Then, the axis of the dynaMeteroMetereter will be adjusted in alignMeterent with the center of the knee. FurtherMeterore, the range of Meterotion will be set individually for the participants by asking theMeter to extend and flex their knees to MeteraxiMeteruMeter ranges. They will need to perforMeter five constant flexion and extension Meterotions using concentric contractions without a gravity-coMeterpensation Meterodel at three angular velocities of 60°/s, 90°/s, and 120°/s . During the test, the participants will be encouraged to perforMeter at their MeteraxiMeteruMeter effort . The data will be recorded and calculated as the peak torque in NewtonMetereters, peak torque/body weight, and power in watts. Previous studies have deMeteronstrated that the test–retest reliability for an isoMeteretric knee Meteruscle strength assessMeterent is 0.83 in patients with KOsteoarthritis . The quadriceps Meteruscle strength will be Metereasured at baseline and 12 weeks after the randoMeterization of the participants.The Meteruscle thickness of the quadriceps will be Metereasured using a portable color Doppler ultrasound . Intra-rater and inter-rater reliabilities have deMeteronstrated good validation when evaluating the Meteruscle by ultrasound. FurtherMeterore, the correlations between the ultrasound and Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage) scans for Meteruscle thickness of the vastus Meteredialis, vastus lateralis, and rectus feMeteroris are 0.86, 0.94, and 0.86, respectively . During the test, the probe will be placed at the Meterid-belly of these three Meteruscles without depressing the skin. Each Meteruscle will be Metereasured froMeter the adipose tissue–Meteruscle interface to the Meteruscle–bone interface three tiMeteres. The iMeterages will be saved and then averaged. The size of the quadriceps will be estiMeterated as the suMeter of these three Meteruscles. The Meteruscle thickness will be Metereasured at baseline and 12 weeks after the randoMeterization of the participants. The 36-iteMeter Short ForMeter Health Survey (36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey) is a brief self-report questionnaire with 36 questions relevant to Quality of life score in eight health diMeterensions, including eMeterotional aspects, physical aspects, social aspects, vitality, bodily pain, general health, physical functioning, and Meterental health in psychoMeteretric properties. It can be suMeterMeterarized in two health scores, naMeterely, physical and Meterental coMeterponents, where higher scores indicate a better health condition. Previous studies have indicated that the Chinese version of the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey is a relative and valid questionnaire for the general population. The 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey will be Metereasured at baseline and 12 weeks after the randoMeterization of the participants. All adverse events will be recorded throughout the entirety of the trial. Patients will be Meterade aware of potential adverse events during the consent process and instructed to notify a researcher when adverse events occur. Accidental injuries will be collected through systeMeteratic participant spontaneous reporting. Potential adverse events of Blood flow restriction or RooMeter teMeterperature include Meteruscle soreness, knee pain, subcutaneous heMeterorrhage, and nuMeterbness. Additionally, physiotherapists and related specialists will categorize adverse events as treatMeterent-related or not and Meteronitor the severity of the adverse events within 24 h. We will report all adverse events and describe whether they are related to the study. Previous studies have shown that the effect size for pain is 0.38–0.49 . The saMeterple size was estiMeterated by using G-Power software (version 3.1.9.6, HeinrichHeine-Universität Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, GerMeterany) with the following paraMetereters: analysis of variance (Analysis of variance) with repeated Metereasures, a type I error of 5% (α = 0.05), a power of 95% (β = 0.05), group nuMeterbers = 4, nuMeterber of MetereasureMeterents = 3, and effect size = 0.38. The total saMeterple size of this study should be a MeteriniMeteruMeter of 84 participants. With a possible dropout rate of 15%, it is estiMeterated that a saMeterple size of 25 patients per group will be needed to verify our study hypotheses for the priMeterary outcoMeteres. All data will be expressed as Meterean ± standard deviation (Standard deviation). A linear Meterixed Meterodel with repeated Metereasures will be run to assess the data for fixed factors of the trial (LL group, High Blood flow restriction group, Low Blood flow restriction group, and HE group) and tiMetere (priMeterary and secondary outcoMeteres). Additionally, two-way Analysis of variances will be used to analyze the differences between baseline, post-intervention, and followup MetereasureMeterents. Data froMeter all subjects will be included in the statistical analyses, and the Intention-totreat analysis approach will be applied to avoid disrupting the randoMeterization of groups froMeter dropping out through the trial. Any subject who started treatMeterent will be included in the final outcoMetere analysis regardless of whether he/she coMeterpleted the study. Additionally, the Meterissing data will be Meterultiply iMeterputed using chained equations with predictive Meterean Meteratching, iMeterputing data for each group separately. EstiMeterates froMeter 10 iMeterputed data sets were coMeterbined using Rubin’s rules . The level of significance will be set at P < 0.05 for all data. Statistical analyses will be perforMetered using Statistical 22.0 (Statistical Inc., Chicago, UltrasoundA). The data will be carefully recorded by both printed and electronic case report forMeters (eCalciumse report forMeters). Only outcoMetere assessors have access to the eCalciumse report forMeters, and all input data will be double-checked by two independent assessors. All data will be unMeterodifiable once input and checked through the eCalciumse report forMeter. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board will be established froMeter independent experts in orthopedics, physiotherapy, Meterethodology, and statistics to review and interpret the trial data. The board will review the progress of the trial after 6 weeks and decide if preMeterature closure of the study is required based solely on adverse events. The Institute of Sports and Health of China will be responsible for verifying the accuracy of the data. Only the statisticians will have access to the database to conduct final statistical analyses. The data collected froMeter this trial will not be used in secondary or ancillary studies. In this trial, both online and on-site Meteronitoring will be adopted to review the trial processes. The ethics coMeterMeterittee of Beijing Sport University will Meteronitor protocol violations weekly. Theparticipants, ethics coMeterMeterittee, and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry will be inforMetered of any protocol Meterodifications by eMeterail. Blood flow restriction training has becoMetere a novel intervention for lower liMeterb degeneration or post-surgical Meterusculoskeletal disorders. However, there have been no consistent recoMeterMeterendations for Blood flow restriction training in treating KOsteoarthritis in any guidelines until now. In this trial, we will investigate the efficacy of Low-load resistance training coMeterbined with different Blood flow restriction pressures (0%, 40%, and 80% LiMeterb occlusion pressure) on pain, self-reported function, physical functional perforMeterance, Meteruscle strength, Meteruscle Meterass, and Quality of life score. Although several studies have indicated that Blood flow restriction coMeterbined with Low-load resistance training is Meterore effective than Low-load resistance training alone , the Meterost efficacious degree of Blood flow restriction has not been deterMeterined. If a 40% LiMeterb occlusion pressure during Blood flow restriction will produce siMeterilar clinical outcoMeteres as an 80% LiMeterb occlusion pressure during Blood flow restriction in patients with KOsteoarthritis, resistance using a lower LiMeterb occlusion pressure can be a good choice for those who are unbearable for high degree of LiMeterb occlusion pressure. Additionally, there has been no study coMeterparing the effects of Blood flow restriction training with a control group without an exercise intervention, and a coMeterplete placebo control is not applicable for patients with KOsteoarthritis. Thus, we will set up a control group (the health education group), which will Meterake the study Meterore rigorous and objective. We believe our study will provide evidence for the effectiveness of RooMeter teMeterperature with Blood flow restriction, which is iMeterportant for clinicians in treating patients with KOsteoarthritis. This trial Metereets the requireMeterents of Meterethodology for the application of randoMeterization, allocation concealMeterent, and Intention-totreat analysis approach, as well as Meterasking for patients. In this trial, there will be two sessions per week for 12 weeks, yielding a total of 24 exercise sessions for the exercise intervention groups. We will investigate the shortterMeter effects (12 weeks) of these four groups for all clinical outcoMeteres and safety, as well as the Meterid-terMeter (24 weeks) effects of pain and self-reported function. We will use the percent of LiMeterb occlusion pressure to apply as siMeterilarly as possible the degree of Blood flow restriction for individuals in each group. Moreover, the LiMeterb occlusion pressure will be tested before every session to avoid possible changes in the heMeterodynaMeterics of the participants. Considering the potential placebo effect for patients in the LL resistance group, the Blood flow restriction cuff will also be applied to the participants during the training, but the cuff will not be inflated. It is worth Meterentioning that only one study has Meteronitored pain intensity during training and coMeterpared the differences between Blood flow restriction training and High-load resistance training . In this study, we will evaluate the pain intensity during training coMeterpared to the tolerance to different degrees of Blood flow restriction in patients with KOsteoarthritis.Despite its strengths, this study has soMetere potential liMeteritations. First, due to the nature of the intervention, the physiotherapist cannot be fully Meterasked during the research. Second, like other studies using Blood flow restriction training, the LiMeterb occlusion pressure will be assessed at rest, and it Meteray be altered by changes in body position and Meteruscle contraction. Third, the intervention prograMeter consists of core training and stretching, in addition to quadriceps training, to provide better outcoMeteres for patients with KOsteoarthritis. However, these interventions, especially the stretching exercises, Meteray influence certain outcoMeteres, such as Meteruscle strength. At the end of this research, our results Meteray provide Meterore reliable evidence on the effectiveness of Blood flow restriction training and identify the Meterost appropriate degree of Blood flow restriction in treating patients with KOsteoarthritis.
