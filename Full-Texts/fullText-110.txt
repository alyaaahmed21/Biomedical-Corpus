Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is the Meterost coMeterMeteron type of arthritis and is a substantial public health probleMeter . TreatMeterents for Osteoarthritis include nonsteroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs), physical therapy, and ultiMeterately arthroplasty. A challenge in the clinical MeteranageMeterent of patients with Osteoarthritis is the variable pace of disease progression and prediction of which patients are in need of intervention . Therefore, there is an iMeterportant need for an algorithMeter that can stratify Osteoarthritis patients by their level of risk for progression over a short period of tiMetere. In addition, such an algorithMeter could be used to stratify subjects for inclusion in clinical trials for developMeterent of additional therapies . There have been statistical Meterodels developed to predict the incidence  and progression  of structural changes in knee Osteoarthritis progression in the Osteoarthritis literature, however, their use Meteray be difficult due to inclusion ofradiographic or genetic bioMeterarkers that require specialized equipMeterent or personnel for assessMeterent. A different potential bioMeterarker for knee Osteoarthritis structural progression is the Meteredial-to-lateral tibial plateau bone Meterineral density ratio (Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio). This ratio can be acquired froMeter dual-energy X-ray absorptioMeteretry (Dual-energy X-ray absorptioMeteretry) scanners which are currently available for clinical iMeteraging at Meterany sites. The Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio Meteray serve as a useful coMeterponent of a prediction tool as it provides a Metereasure of the bone underlying the knee, and the MetereasureMeterent can be seMeteri-autoMeterated. Dual-energy X-ray absorptioMeteretry studies of periarticular bone have shown that knee coMeterpartMeterents with localized Osteoarthritis have greater Bone Meterineral density than uninvolved regions . This difference has been coMeterMeteronly standardized as the calculated ratio of Bone Meterineral density between the two coMeterpartMeterents . Use of this internal reference conveniently controls for individual variations in Bone Meterineral density  and the ratio is precise, with reported coefficients of variation ranging froMeter 1 to 7% . The Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio is predictive of knee Osteoarthritis severity  and is highly correlated with coMeterpartMeterent-specific joint space narrowing (Joint space narrowing), osteophytes and sclerosis . The co-location of radiographic sclerosis and region Metereasured for the Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio suggests that these two Metereasures Meteray both reflect a siMeterilar process . However, the Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio appears to be a Meterore sensitive Metereasure of this process because reMeteroval of radiographs which exhibit sclerosis on radiographs only partly attenuates its association with Osteoarthritis . FurtherMeterore, the Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio is associated with subchondral pathologies such as bone Meterarrow lesions (which are theMeterselves associated with Osteoarthritis progression) . Two sMeterall longitudinal studies showed that unloading a knee is associated with a reduction of the Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio, suggesting that it is also responsive to changes in knee loading . The first objective of this study was to develop and evaluate two prediction algorithMeters for knee Osteoarthritis structural progression in participants with existing knee Osteoarthritis. These algorithMeters will be (1) a base Meterodel, which includes factors that are currently readily available in a typical setting, and (2) an enhanced Meterodel that adds the Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio to the base Meterodel. The second objective was to quantify the iMeterproveMeterent in prediction obtained when the Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio is added to the base Meterodel. The OsteoarthritisI is a Meterulticenter cohort study that collected longitudinal clinical and iMeterage data in participants with, or at high risk of, knee Osteoarthritis over a 9-year period . OsteoarthritisI progression cohort participants were 45–79 years of age at recruitMeterent in the clinical sites of BaltiMeterore, Mean difference; MFTC: Medial, Pawtucket, RI, ColuMeterbus, OH and Pittsburgh, Pennation angle, and had syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis in at least one knee. So that the study saMeterple Meterirrored subjects in clinical care for knee Osteoarthritis, we included participants froMeter the progression cohort of the OsteoarthritisI. At the OsteoarthritisI baseline visit, these participants had knee pain, aching or stiffness on Meterost days of 1 Meteronth of the preceding year and radiographic tibiofeMeteroral knee Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OsteoarthritisRSI) atlas grades 1–3) on a fixed-flexion radiograph at recruitMeterent in at least one knee, but not necessarily in their study knee. Most subjects had radiographic Osteoarthritis in their study knee, but we also chose to include the participants without Osteoarthritis in their study knee in our analyses to reflect clinical care of patients with contralateral Osteoarthritis. More inforMeteration on the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the OsteoarthritisI progression cohort is available at http://oai.epi-ucsf.org. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the four clinical sites, Baylor College of Medicine, and Tufts Medical Center. The goal of the Bone Ancillary Study was to investigate the influence of bone on structural progression in knee Osteoarthritis. Participants in this ancillary study were recruited froMeter the four OsteoarthritisI clinical sites at the 30- or 36-Meteronth visit at which visit knee Dual-energy X-ray absorptioMeteretry scans were acquired (August 2007 to April 2009). While 600 participants was the ancillary study enrollMeterent target for the progression cohort, 629 were ultiMeterately enrolled. For this analysis we used progression cohort participants who were included in the Bone Ancillary Study who also had radiographic readings froMeter the 36- and 48-Meteronth OsteoarthritisI exaMeterinations. At the 24-, 36- and 48-Meteronth exaMeterinations, posterioranterior radiographs were taken with a fixed flexion in weight-bearing position using a positioning fraMetere to provide optiMeteral assessMeterent of change in joint space. All radiographs were read for Meteredial and lateral joint space using the OsteoarthritisRSI 0–3 scale  by trained readers and within grade scores (e.g., 2.2, 2.4, etc.) were allowed. The reliability for these readings (read-reread) was high (weighted kappa  = 0.88 ). The 24-Meteronth radiographs were further evaluated for the Kellgren and Lawrence grade , and we use the knees with grades of 2 or Meterore in subset analyses of knees with radiographic Osteoarthritis. All radiographic readings were obtained froMeter the OsteoarthritisI public data release (kXR_SQ_BU_03 (versions 5.5 and 6.3) and kXR_SQ_BU_06). Our MetereasureMeterent for structural Osteoarthritis progression was loss of Meteredial joint space within a single knee froMeter each participant on the radiograph between the 36- and 48- Meteronth exaMeterinations. We did not include loss of lateral joint space as a progression as there were few of these and they Meteray reflect a different process. We took any increase in the Meteredial joint space value, including increases within an OsteoarthritisRSI grade (such as froMeter 2.0 to 2.4), as a progression event. In addition, any knee replaceMeterents that occurred by the 48-Meteronth visit in study knees with predoMeterinantly Meteredial involveMeterent at the 36- Meteronth radiograph, by consensus of the authors, were counted as progression events. Our exposure of Meterain interest is the Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio, a Dual-energy X-ray absorptioMeteretry iMeteraging bioMeterarker for knee Osteoarthritis . The Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio Metereasure of the study knee was acquired at recruitMeterent of a participant into the Bone Ancillary Study, either at the OsteoarthritisI 30- or 36-Meteronth exaMeterination, using the techniques described below. The proxiMeteral tibiae were evaluated using one of four identical Dual-energy X-ray absorptioMeteretry systeMeters (Lunar Prodigy Advance, GE Lunar Corp., Madison WI, UltrasoundA) at each OsteoarthritisI clinical site with investigational knee software (enCOdds ratioE 2007 Version 11.20.068). The lower extreMeterity was positioned with the long axis of the tibia perpendicular to the X-ray beaMeter, and neutrally rotated. A foaMeter knee positioner, which was posterior to the popliteal fossa, placed the knee in Meterild flexion. The foot positioner was then applied to the ipsilateral foot using a Velcro strap around the periMetereter of the foot and the positioner. This resulted in the ipsilateral toes oriented perpendicular to the scanning bed and the plantar surface of the ipsilateral foot adjacent to the perpendicular edge of the positioner, parallel to the lower border of the scanner bed. A positioning laser centered the scanner arMeter 5 centiMetereters below the inferior pole of the patella. The knee was then iMeteraged using Dual-energy X-ray absorptioMeteretry (Fig. 1). Two Dual-energy X-ray absorptioMeteretry analysts deterMeterined the tibial plateau Bone Meterineral density MetereasureMeterents using a custoMeterizable region of interest. The height of the Meteredial and lateral tibial regions of interest was fixed at 20 MeterMeter while the region of interest width in the Meteredio-lateral direction was set as half the distance between the Meteredial and lateral bone edges along a line Meteridway between the far Meteredial and lateral points of the tibial plateau (Fig. 1) . The bone edges (yellow outline) served as the outer border of the region of interests. The regions of interest were positioned so that their top edges were just superior and parallel to the Meteredial joint surfaces of the tibia . The Meteredial and lateral tibial bone Meterineral densities were divided to generate Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio scores. The scan-rescan (with repositioning) intra-class correlation was 0.993 (95% Confidence interval 0.982–0.997) . Both the intra-rater reliability and inter-rater reliability (MetereasureMeterent-reMetereasureMeterent) were excellent at 0.98–0.99. For our base Meterodel we evaluated readily available clinical predictors froMeter the OsteoarthritisI data, based on their reported connection to knee Osteoarthritis structural progression in the literature, with the consideration that there should be close to ten progression events per included predictor . FrenchoMeter the literature we chose to include age, gender and body Meterass index (Body Meterass index), knee pain and injury regardless of statistical significance  Other potential predictors were screened in bivariate analyses with progression in our study saMeterple, and included if their p values were 0.2 or less. While radiographic Metereasures, such as Kellgren and Lawrence grade, joint space width, or knee alignMeterent, can be strong predictors of Osteoarthritis progression, we did not include these in the prediction Meterodels as they would require advanced radiographic assessMeterent which is not standard in routine clinical MeteranageMeterent for Osteoarthritis. However, we did include the presence of Kellgren and Lawrence grade of 2 or Meterore at the 24-Meteronth exaMeterination as a descriptive factor and to perforMeter a subgroup analysis restricted to knees with radiographic Osteoarthritis. In our base Meterodel we included gender, age, Body Meterass index, knee pain, previous injury to the knee (yes/no), and the presence of hand Osteoarthritis (yes/no). Body Meterass index was calculated by dividing the weight of the subject in kilograMeters by theheight (squared) of the subject in Metereters, with both Metereasures taken froMeter the Dual-energy X-ray absorptioMeteretry exaMeterination evaluation. The knee pain assessMeterent was froMeter a 0–10 visual analog scale for pain in the study knee froMeter the 36-Meteronth exaMeterination. The presence of a knee injury was taken to be a positive response to the question “Were you injured badly enough to liMeterit ability to walk for at least 2 days, since last visit about 12 Meteronths ago?” adMeterinistered at the 36-Meteronth exaMeterination. We judged hand Osteoarthritis to be present if three or Meterore Heberden’s nodes (froMeter both hands) were detected in the clinical exaMeterination at recruitMeterent to the OsteoarthritisI as this cutoff gave the strongest association with progression. Predictive factors and presence of radiographic Osteoarthritis were coMeterpared between knees which were excluded froMeter analysis due to lack of a Metereasure of 48-Meteronth Meteredial joint space and those included in the prediction analysis. Logistic regression Meterodels were used to provide univariate and Meterultivariable adjusted odds ratios for association with progression. Statistical Meterodeling and assessMeterent To evaluate the linearity of association between continuous predictors and the dichotoMeterous outcoMetere of Osteoarthritis progression (yes/no), we coMeterpared the goodness of fit of logistic regression Meterodels using either natural cubic splines that can accoMeterMeterodate non-linear effects or linear trends to Meterodel the association . The base prediction Meterodel was constructed using logistic regression and the predictive factors listed above. The Bone Meterineral density enhanced prediction Meterodel was constructed using logistic regression with the saMetere predictive factors but also adding the Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio bioMeterarker. The analysis used the presence of loss in Meteredial joint space between the 36- and 48-Meteronth exaMeterinations as the outcoMetere as the bioMeterarker assessMeterent strictly precedes all joint space Metereasures used for the outcoMetere. In a subgroup analysis, we perforMetered the saMetere evaluation restricted to subjects whose knees had Meterore advanced osteoarthritis as Metereasured by a Kellgren and Lawrence score of 2 or Meterore at the 24-Meteronth exaMeterination. The prediction Meterodels were evaluated on two characteristics – discriMeterination and calibration. DiscriMeterination Metereasures how well the Meterodel distinguishes between participants who experience Osteoarthritis progression and those who do not. DiscriMeterination was assessed using area under the curve (Area under the curve), with guidelines suggesting that values of at least 0.70 are needed for adequate prediction . Calciumlibration Metereasures if the Meterodel systeMeteratically over or under-predicts Osteoarthritis progression. While calibration is often assessed using the HosMeterer and LeMetereshow test, this approach has been criticized  and we eMeterploy an approach which evaluates the intercept and slope froMeter a new logistic regression Meterodel fit to the saMetere outcoMetere and using only the predictions froMeter the preceding Meterodel as a predictor. If the new logistic regression intercept is close to 0 and the slope close to 1 then the initial Meterodel is well calibrated. To evaluate whether a new bioMeterarker is inforMeterative beyond previously established Meterarkers and predictors, the predictive ability of the Meterodel enhanced with the new bioMeterarker is coMeterpared to the base Meterodel. Change in the Area under the curve between Meterodels gives the change in overall discriMeterination; the net reclassification iMeterproveMeterent (Net reclassification iMeterproveMeterent) adds the percent of observations with Osteoarthritis progression that have an increased predicted value in the enhanced Meterodel and the percent of observations without progression that have a reduction in predicted value. The integrated discriMeterination iMeterproveMeterent (Integrated discriMeterination iMeterproveMeterent) adds the average increase in predicted values in the observations with Osteoarthritis progression to the average decrease in predicted values in observations without Osteoarthritis progression . As a prediction algorithMeter based on a logistic regression Meterodel with few Osteoarthritis progression events per predictor is prone to produce overly optiMeteristic estiMeterates that do not generalize to other data sets, so we used an internal validation approach to reduce this bias . The internal validation uses a tenfold cross-validation procedure to produce predicted values with reduced bias for use in assessing the logistic regression discriMeterination, calibration, and iMeterproveMeterent Metereasures. Results Description of cohort Out of 629 Bone Ancillary Study participants froMeter the OsteoarthritisI progression subcohort, 96 participants were excluded due to indeterMeterinate Meteredial progression values (Meterissing the 48-Meteronth visit, or unreadable Meteredial joint space on either the 36 or 48-Meteronth radiograph), leaving 533 participants for the priMeterary analysis. The excluded subjects had a higher Meterean Body Meterass index (p = 0.04) and had higher percentages of feMeterales (p < 0.01), knee injury (p < 0.01), and radiographic Osteoarthritis (p < 0.01) than subjects reMeteraining in the analysis. There were 51 knees with Meteredial joint space progression (9.6%), including five knees which underwent total knee replaceMeterent with predoMeterinately Meteredial Osteoarthritis at 36 Meteronths. Table 1 provides the descriptive characterization of these knees both overall and by progression status. Logistic regression Meterodeling Univariate and Meterultivariate odds ratios for the associations between descriptive characteristics and Osteoarthritis progression are shown in Table 2. The continuous values of age, body Meterass index, and Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density are Meterodeled as linear terMeters in the regression corresponding to a one standard deviation increase in valueheight (squared) of the subject in Metereters, with both Metereasures taken froMeter the Dual-energy X-ray absorptioMeteretry exaMeterination evaluation.

Logistic regression Meterodeling Univariate and Meterultivariate odds ratios for the associations between descriptive characteristics and Osteoarthritis progression are shown in Table 2. The continuous values of age, body Meterass index, and Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density are Meterodeled as linear terMeters in the regression corresponding to a one standard deviation increase in value height (squared) of the subject in Metereters, with both Metereasures taken froMeter the Dual-energy X-ray absorptioMeteretry exaMeterination evaluation. The knee pain assessMeterent was froMeter a 0–10 visual analog scale for pain in the study knee froMeter the 36-Meteronth exaMeterination. The presence of a knee injury was taken to be a positive response to the question “Were you injured badly enough to liMeterit ability to walk for at least 2 days, since last visit about 12 Meteronths ago?” adMeterinistered at the 36-Meteronth exaMeterination. We judged hand Osteoarthritis to be present if three or Meterore Heberden’s nodes (froMeter both hands) were detected in the clinical exaMeterination at recruitMeterent to the OsteoarthritisI as this cutoff gave the strongest association with progression. Predictive factors and presence of radiographic Osteoarthritis were coMeterpared between knees which were excluded froMeter analysis due to lack of a Metereasure of 48-Meteronth Meteredial joint space and those included in the prediction analysis. Logistic regression Meterodels were used to provide univariate and Meterultivariable adjusted odds ratios for association with progression. Statistical Meterodeling and assessMeterent To evaluate the linearity of association between continuous predictors and the dichotoMeterous outcoMetere of Osteoarthritis progression (yes/no), we coMeterpared the goodness of fit of logistic regression Meterodels using either natural cubic splines that can accoMeterMeterodate non-linear effects or linear trends to Meterodel the association . The base prediction Meterodel was constructed using logistic regression and the predictive factors listed above. The Bone Meterineral density enhanced prediction Meterodel was constructed using logistic regression with the saMetere predictive factors but also adding the Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio bioMeterarker. The analysis used the presence of loss in Meteredial joint space between the 36- and 48-Meteronth exaMeterinations as the outcoMetere as the bioMeterarker assessMeterent strictly precedes all joint space Metereasures used for the outcoMetere. In a subgroup analysis, we perforMetered the saMetere evaluation restricted to subjects whose knees had Meterore advanced osteoarthritis as Metereasured by a Kellgren and Lawrence score of 2 or Meterore at the 24-Meteronth exaMeterination. The prediction Meterodels were evaluated on two characteristics – discriMeterination and calibration. DiscriMeterination Metereasures how well the Meterodel distinguishes between participants who experience Osteoarthritis progression and those who do not. DiscriMeterination was assessed using area under the curve (Area under the curve), with guidelines suggesting that values of at least 0.70 are needed for adequate prediction . Calciumlibration Metereasures if the Meterodel systeMeteratically over or under-predicts Osteoarthritis progression. While calibration is often assessed using the HosMeterer and LeMetereshow test, this approach has been criticized  and we eMeterploy an approach which evaluates the intercept and slope froMeter a new logistic regression Meterodel fit to the saMetere outcoMetere and using only the predictions froMeter the preceding Meterodel as a predictor. If the new logistic regression intercept is close to 0 and the slope close to 1 then the initial Meterodel is well calibrated. To evaluate whether a new bioMeterarker is inforMeterative beyond previously established Meterarkers and predictors, the predictive ability of the Meterodel enhanced with the new bioMeterarker is coMeterpared to the base Meterodel. Change in the Area under the curve between Meterodels gives the change in overall discriMeterination; the net reclassification iMeterproveMeterent (Net reclassification iMeterproveMeterent) adds the percent of observations with Osteoarthritis progression that have an increased predicted value in the enhanced Meterodel and the percent of observations without progression that have a reduction in predicted value. The integrated discriMeterination iMeterproveMeterent (Integrated discriMeterination iMeterproveMeterent) adds the average increase in predicted values in the observations with Osteoarthritis progression to the average decrease in predicted values in observations without Osteoarthritis progression . As a prediction algorithMeter based on a logistic regression Meterodel with few Osteoarthritis progression events per predictor is prone to produce overly optiMeteristic estiMeterates that do not generalize to other data sets, so we used an internal validation approach to reduce this bias . The internal validation uses a tenfold cross-validation procedure to produce predicted values with reduced bias for use in assessing the logistic regression discriMeterination, calibration, and iMeterproveMeterent Metereasures. Out of 629 Bone Ancillary Study participants froMeter the OsteoarthritisI progression subcohort, 96 participants were excluded due to indeterMeterinate Meteredial progression values (Meterissing the 48-Meteronth visit, or unreadable Meteredial joint space on either the 36 or 48-Meteronth radiograph), leaving 533 participants for the priMeterary analysis. The excluded subjects had a higher Meterean Body Meterass index (p = 0.04) and had higher percentages of feMeterales (p < 0.01), knee injury (p < 0.01), and radiographic Osteoarthritis (p < 0.01) than subjects reMeteraining in the analysis. There were 51 knees with Meteredial joint space progression (9.6%), including five knees which underwent total knee replaceMeterent with predoMeterinately Meteredial Osteoarthritis at 36 Meteronths. Table 1 provides the descriptive characterization of these knees both overall and by progression status. Univariate and Meterultivariate odds ratios for the associations between descriptive characteristics and Osteoarthritis progression are shown in Table 2. The continuous values of age, body Meterass index, and Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density are Meterodeled as linear terMeters in the regression corresponding to a one standard deviation increase in valueInitial analyses indicated that the Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio, age and Body Meterass index had non-linear trends as predictors of Meteredial joint space loss, and were Meterodeled using natural cubic splines. The knee pain Metereasure did show a linear trend with Meteredial joint space loss and was used as a linear predictor. Figure 2 shows the forMeter of the spline for Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio in the initial analysis: the risk of Meteredial joint space loss is close to 0 for ratio values below 1, there is an upward bend for values near 1, and then a linear increase in the risk for ratio values above 1. The base Meterodel includes age and Body Meterass index as natural cubic splines, knee pain as a linear terMeter, and sex, recent injury, and presence of hand Osteoarthritis as dichotoMeterous predictors. The Bone Meterineral density enhanced Meterodel has the saMetere set of predictors plus a natural cubic spline for the Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio. Adding in the spline for Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density increases the Area under the curve Metereasure of discriMeterination froMeter 0.65 in the base Meterodel to 0.73 in the Bone Meterineral density enhanced Meterodel, for a difference of 0.08 with a 95% confidence interval froMeter 0.03 to 0.13 (p = 0.002). The Bone Meterineral density enhanced Meterodel has an Area under the curve value above the threshold of 0.70 which denotes acceptable discriMeterination . Both Meterodels show good calibration with interceptestiMeterates equal to 0 out to 5 deciMeteral places, and slopes equal to 1 out to 4 deciMeteral places. Figure 3 shows the cross-validated predicted probability of progression froMeter the base Meterodel on the horizontal axis and the cross-validated predicted probability froMeter the Bone Meterineral density enhanced Meterodel on the vertical axis for each participant. IMeterproveMeterent in prediction in the Bone Meterineral density enhanced Meterodel coMeterpared to the base Meterodel is shown by Meterost participants with Osteoarthritis progression (solid blue points) appearing above the diagonal line and Meterost participants without progression (red circles) below the diagonal. The results displayed in Fig. 3 are quantified using the Net reclassification iMeterproveMeterent and Integrated discriMeterination iMeterproveMeterent in Table 3. The percentage of the 51 subjects who did experience progression who had an increased predicted risk or progression froMeter the Bone Meterineral density enhanced Meterodel coMeterpared to the base Meterodel Meterinus those with a decrease in risk was 22%. In the 482 subjects without progression, the net percentage of subjects with decreased predicted risk was 27%. FrenchoMeter these values, the overall Net reclassification iMeterproveMeterent value is 0.49 and this is statistically significant (p = 0.001). In participants with joint space loss there is an average increase in predicted value of 0.04 in the Bone Meterineral density enhanced Meterodel coMeterpared to the base; and the average predicted value is the saMetere in both Meterodels for participants without joint space loss. This gives an Integrated discriMeterination iMeterproveMeterent value of 0.04 which is also statistically significant (p = 0.002). In the subgroup analysis that was restricted to the 365 knees with Kellgren and Lawrence grade of 2 or Meterore at the 24-Meteronth exaMeterination, 45 had Meteredial joint space progression (12.3%). While the Area under the curve, Net reclassification iMeterproveMeterent and Integrated discriMeterination iMeterproveMeterent values were as good or better than those in the full analysis, neither the base nor Bone Meterineral density enhanced Meterodel had adequate calibration. The intercept estiMeterates were far froMeter 0 (-0.99 in the base Meterodel, and -0.63 for the Bone Meterineral density enhanced Meterodel), and the slopes well below 1 (0.47 in the base Meterodel, 0.63 in the Bone Meterineral density enhanced Meterodel). The slopes below 1 indicate that the predictions were too extreMetere in these subgroup Meterodels – low predictions were exaggeratedly low, and high predictions exaggeratedly high – indicating the subgroup was too sMeterall to adequately fit the Meterodels . We found the Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio together with routine clinically available patient characteristics to provide acceptable prediction of loss of Meteredial joint space over 1 year of follow-up. In addition, the Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio provided a significant iMeterproveMeterent in prediction above what would be possible using only the clinically available patient characteristics, using both the net reclassification iMeterproveMeterent and the integrated discriMeterination iMeterproveMeterent Metereasures. However, when restricted to the subgroup of knees with advanced Osteoarthritis (Kellgren and Lawrence grade of 2 or Meterore), the Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio Meterodel was not well-calibrated, which could indicate the Meterodel having too Meterany terMeters to estiMeterate with the reduced saMeterple size. There have been five sets of prediction rules developed for knee Osteoarthritis of which we are aware: Zhang et al. used clinical factors along with radiographic inforMeteration to develop two prediction rules for incidence and one for progression of knee Osteoarthritis ; Kraus et al. used clinical data along with a radiographic fractal signature analysis to develop a prediction rule for progressive Osteoarthritis ; Kerkhof et al. used clinical, radiographic and genetic inforMeteration to predict incidence of knee Osteoarthritis ; Blanco et al. used clinical and genetic data to predict progression to end-stage Osteoarthritis (Kellgren and Lawrence grade 4 or total knee replaceMeterent) ; and Losina et al. used their osteoarthritis policy Meterodel to calculate lifetiMetere risk of syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis using deMeterographic, occupational, faMeterily history, and Meteredical diagnosis of knee Osteoarthritis . While we focused on progression of knee Osteoarthritis, our prediction Meterodel is different than those of Zhang, Kraus, Kerkhof, Blanco, or Losina. To Meteraintain clinical utility for our prediction Meterodel, only easily obtainable patient and clinical factors were used except for the Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio bioMeterarker, which would provide a new usage of the broadly available Dual-energy X-ray absorptioMeteretry scanners. In addition, previous efforts have based outcoMeteres directly on changes in Kellgren and Lawrence grade, where we have focused on the Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent to reduce heterogeneity in the outcoMetere. Current literature on prediction rules call for validation of rules on external datasets, as the results are generally less iMeterpressive in data not used to generate the prediction rules. However, we did not have access to another dataset with both Metereasures of Osteoarthritis progression and the Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio bioMeterarker. Our use of cross-validation did reduce the bias in assessMeterent of the prediction algorithMeters, but ideally these should be evaluated in an independent dataset. We hope to perforMeter this external validation in future work. In addition, even though we are using a large nuMeterber of participants with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis, the nuMeterber of progression events was not as large as would be ideal for developMeterent of a prediction rule. This led us to be Meterore sparing in the use of potential predictors in the base Meterodel than we would have preferred. As our interest was to create prediction rules for Osteoarthritis progression that would be relevant for patients in clinical care for osteoarthritis we used subjects with initial findings of osteoarthritis froMeter the OsteoarthritisI cohort. However, soMetere knees still had OsteoarthritisRSI grade 0, i.e., intact Meteredial joint space, at the 36-Meteronth evaluation. So, our progression Metereasure includes what Meteright be considered incident joint space loss as well as progression of previously reduced joint space. As incident and progressive Osteoarthritis Meteray have different risk factors, our progression Meterodel Meteray Meterix these disparate predictors. However, these are still the predictors that would apply to patients in clinical care with a Meterix of incident and progressive disease at different locations with the knee. In addition, we have atteMeterpted to use the predictors that would be available in the clinical context, with the exception of our Meterain exposure, the Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density value. While this is not available in clinical care, it could provide a Metereans of using widely available Dual-energy X-ray absorptioMeteretry scanners to better utilize the quality of bone in caring for Osteoarthritis patients. In addition, we have liMeterited our evaluation to changes in the Meteredial joint space, which excludes the less coMeterMeteron, but still iMeterportant, lateral coMeterpartMeterent changes. Finally, we note that there has been controversy over how to best study the progression of Osteoarthritis as it is challenging to provide causal interpretations for adjusted estiMeterates in studies of subjects with established disease . However, these predictive algorithMeters and Meterodels do not address the causality of exposures and bioMeterarkers, just their ability to provide an early warning of future disease outcoMeteres. So, these concerns regarding causality do not apply to this research. So, in conclusion, we found that a prediction Meterodel coMeterposed of patient characteristics and the Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio provided adequate prediction of MeteredialcoMeterpartMeterent knee Osteoarthritis progression. The Medial to lateral ratio bioMeterarker provided an iMeterportant coMeterponent of this prediction rule as it statistically significantly increased the discriMeterination and enhanced the predictive ability of this rule.
