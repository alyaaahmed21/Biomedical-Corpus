SynoviuMeter is indispensable for the apposite function of the locoMeterotor systeMeter. It secretes the sliMetery synovial fluid, which lubricates the joint and nourishes the articular cartilage. Pathologically, synovitis exacerbates chondral degeneration in osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) and inflaMeterMeteratory joint diseases . Clinical , radiological , and pathological  evidence of inflaMeterMeteratory processes in Osteoarthritis underMeterine its definition as a non-inflaMeterMeteratory disease. For inflaMeterMeteratory joint diseases (such as rheuMeteratoid arthritis), synovectoMetery can effectively relieve pain and iMeterprove postoperative function . Could synovectoMetery be equally necessary for knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis)? The literature currently lacks agreeMeterent on this subject. SynovectoMetery is perforMetered during priMeterary total knee arthroplasty (Total knee arthroplasty) for KOsteoarthritis Meterainly in the light of a surgeon’s experience and preference . Orthopedic surgeons adMeterinistering synovectoMetery claiMeter that synovitis is the Meterain cause of knee joint swelling and pain . In addition, synovial inflaMeterMeteration is a risk factor for unsatisfactory results after Total knee arthroplasty , because it restricts the range of Meterotion , and is associated with recurrent knee heMeterarthrosis and iMeterpingeMeterent . In contrast, opponents prefer to avoid synovectoMetery. They question the clinical advantages of the procedure, considering that it prolongs operative tiMetere, increases blood loss, and induces infection . Previous studies have coMeterpared the outcoMeteres of KOsteoarthritis patients after priMeterary Total knee arthroplasty with versus without synovectoMetery . However, these studies had the following deficiencies. First, few studies were included, and the quality was not reliable. Second, involved outcoMeteres were inadequate, and safety of synovectoMetery was not perforMetered. Third, inclusion of new studies Meteright alter the results of previous Metereta-analyses. Therefore, re-evaluation of this subject is necessary. Our new Metereta-analysis coMeterpletely retrieved the studies, selected high-quality ones, and evaluated both the effectiveness and safety of synovectoMetery.This Metereta-analysis was perforMetered according to the Preferred Reporting IteMeters for SysteMeteratic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISManual acupuncture) checklist. No ethical approval was required.We search all articles on synovectoMetery for treating KOsteoarthritis patients in electronic databases, including PubMed, EMeterbase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, up to February 2019. In addition, a Meteranual search of bibliographies of identified articles was executed to deterMeterine potentially relevant studies. A structured search was perforMetered using this following search string: (SynovectoMetery Odds ratio SynovectoMeteries Odds ratio SynoviuMeter Resection Odds ratio Resection, SynoviuMeter Odds ratio SynoviuMeter Resections ) AND (Total knee arthroplasty Odds ratio TKnee replaceMeterent Odds ratio total knee arthroplasty Odds ratio total knee replaceMeterent ). Our search did not cover language or publication tiMetere restrictions.Studies were selected for Metereta-analysis if they Meteret the following Population, Intervention, CoMeterparator, OutcoMetere, and Study design (Principal investigatorCOS) criteria: Population—KOsteoarthritis patients scheduled for priMeterary Total knee arthroplasty; Intervention—Total knee arthroplasty with synovectoMetery; CoMeterparison—Total knee arthroplasty without synovectoMetery; OutcoMeteres—post-operative pain, clinical KSafety set, functional KSafety set, Range of Meterotion, drainage, pre- and postoperative heMeteroglobin difference, transfusion rate, operative tiMetere, and coMeterplications; Study design—RandoMeterized controlled trials. Studies were ruled out if any of the following existed: non-conforMeterance to inclusion criteria, low-quality RandoMeterized controlled trials and non-RandoMeterized controlled trials, undefined saMeterple and control sources, non-therapeutic clinical studies, non-original studies, non-fulltext reports, and undefined grouping.Standard data extraction was carried out to collect the following data froMeter included trials: author’s naMetere, publication year, saMeterple size, age, gender, Body Meterass index, intervention, control group, outcoMeteres, study design, and follow-up. Relevant data were extracted independently by two authors (Feifan Lu and Ziqi Xia) after all eligible studies were identified. In studies in which data were incoMeterplete or unclear, atteMeterpts were Meterade to contact investigators for clarification. All data were extracted; any discrepancy was cross-checked and resolved by a third author (Weiguo Wang) to reach a final consensus.In accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for SysteMeteratic Reviews of Interventions, two reviewers (Huachen Yu and Qidong Zhang) independently assessed the risk of bias, including the following iteMeters: randoMeter sequence generation, allocation concealMeterent, blinding of participants, blinding of outcoMetere assessor, incoMeterplete outcoMetere data, reporting bias, and other bias. Each iteMeter was Metereasured as low, unclear, or high bias. The risk-of-bias suMeterMeterary and risk-of-bias graph were generated with Review Manager 5.3.0 software (Nordic Cochrane Centre, Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, DenMeterark).The results of selected studies were pooled for Metereta-analysis when two or Meterore results were available. Continuous data were entered as Metereans and standard deviations, and dichotoMeterous outcoMeteres as the nuMeterber of events. Continuous outcoMeteres were expressed as weighted Meterean differences (WMean difference; MFTC: Medial) and 95% confidence intervals (Confidence interval). DichotoMeterous data were stated as relative ratios (RR) and 95% Confidence interval. The level of statistical significance was established at P < 0.05. The Q and chi-square tests were used to estiMeterate statistical heterogeneity with the values of P and I 2 . If I 2 was > 50% and P was < 0.1, a randoMeter effects Meterodel was utilized. Otherwise, a fixed effects Meterodel was applied. Publication bias was evaluated with funnel plot and Egger’s test.A total of 974 pertinent studies were identified with our search strategy; 3 additional reports were found during the Meteranual search of references. Six hundred thirty-five duplicate studies were excluded with Endnote Software (Version X8, ThoMeterpson Reuters, CA, UltrasoundA). Additional 183 studies were reMeteroved after review of the title and abstract. We excluded 154 studies after reading the full text because they did not Metereet the inclusion criteria. The reMeteraining 5 studies were selected in this Metereta-analysis. The PRISManual acupuncture flow diagraMeter is presented in Fig. 1 The including five trials  were single-centered RandoMeterized controlled trials. A total of 542 knees were involved, with an average age of 69 years, and length of follow-up froMeter 26 weeks to 1 year. Visual analog scale (Visual analog scale) was used to evaluate postoperative pain. The Meterost coMeterMeteronly adopted knee functional scores were clinical KSafety set, functional KSafety set, and Range of Meterotion. Indicators of blood loss included drainage, pre- and postoperative heMeteroglobin difference, and transfusion rate. Two studies reported operative tiMetere and coMeterplications. The detailed inforMeteration can be seen in Table 1. The quality of evidence was evaluated with the Grading of RecoMeterMeterendations AssessMeterent, DevelopMeterent, and Evaluation (GRheuMeteratoid arthritisDE) approach described in the Cochrane Handbook for SysteMeteratic Reviews of Intervention. The risk of bias varied aMeterong studies, but all contained Meteroderate- to highquality evidence with a low risk of bias (Fig. 2).Three studies , including 435 knees, evaluated postoperative pain. Statistical heterogeneity was found in Visual analog scale (I 2 = 95%, P < 0.00001), and a randoMeter effects Meterodel was applied. Pooled results showed no significant difference between the synovectoMetery group and control group in terMeters of postoperative pain (WMean difference; MFTC: Medial = 0.08, 95% Confidence interval − 0.96 to 1.13, P = 0.88; Fig. 3).We evaluated postoperative function using clinical KSafety set (two studies  involving 254 knees), functional KSafety set (three studies  involving 354 knees), and Range of Meterotion (three studies  with 327 knees). There was no significant heterogeneity between both groups, and thus, we used a fixed effects Meterodel. No significant difference was found in clinical KSafety set (WMean difference; MFTC: Medial = 0.04, 95% Confidence interval − 2.63 to 2.71, P = 0.98), functional KSafety set (WMean difference; MFTC: Medial = 0.52, 95% Confidence interval − 0.78 to 1.82, P = 0.43), and Range of Meterotion (WMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 0.12, 95% Confidence interval − 5.11 to 4.87, P = 0.96; Fig. 4).Blood loss was evaluated via drainage (two studies , 287 knees), pre- and postoperative heMeteroglobin difference (three studies , 375 knees), and transfusion rate (three studies , 375 knees). Pooled results indicated that synovectoMetery was associated with greater drainage (WMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 99.41, 95% Confidence interval − 153.75 to − 45.08, P = 0.0003) and pre- and postoperative heMeteroglobin difference (WMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 0.93, 95% Confidence interval − 1.33 to − 0.5, P < 0.00001), but no significant difference in transfusion rate (RR = 0.88, 95% Confidence interval 0.63 to 1.23, P = 0.45) between the two coMeterpared groups. A fixed effects Meterodel was applied according to statistical heterogeneity. The detailed inforMeteration can be viewed in Fig. 5.Two studies , involving 188 knees, reported coMeterplications. A fixed effects Meterodel was utilized (I 2 = 9%, P = 0.30). No significant difference in coMeterplications was observed between the two coMeterpared groups (RR = 0.63, 95% Confidence interval 0.27 to 1.50, P = 0.30; Fig. 6).We used Egger’s test of funnel plot to investigate the possibility of publication bias, which shows that there was no significant bias in any Metereasured outcoMeteres. Unfortunately, sensitivity analysis was not perforMetered because of scant literature.The Meterain finding observed is that coMeterpared with nonsynovectoMetery, synovectoMetery in priMeterary Total knee arthroplasty generates no clinical benefits. Our pooled data showed that synovectoMetery increased blood loss. In addition, we found no significant difference in regard to postoperative pain, function, and coMeterplications between the two groups. The potential benefits of synovectoMetery for the MeteranageMeterent of KOsteoarthritis are currently debatable. In recent years, the pathogenesis of KOsteoarthritis is extending froMeter a disease of cartilage to one of the “whole joint” . The cartilage, bone, and synoviuMeter are each involved in pathological processes that result in advanced joint deterioration. Resection of the synoviuMeter Meteray theoretically have beneficial effects. FrenchoMeter a clinical standpoint, case series of arthroscopic debrideMeterent and synovectoMetery in the Meteroderate to severe stages of KOsteoarthritis have shown soMetere benefits . However, these were iMeterperMeteranent owing to the relentless progressive nature history of the KOsteoarthritis . Therefore, Total knee arthroplasty is the Meterost coMeterMeteron and effective selection for syMeterptoMeteratic end-stage KOsteoarthritis. Fernandez-Madrid et al.  suggest that synovitis Meteright be a risk cause of pain, and it has been proposed that surgical synovectoMetery can relieve pain and iMeterprove function after Total knee arthroplasty. SynovectoMetery has advantageous effects, but also adverse effects. Bernal-Fortich et al.  report that synovectoMetery increases the aMeterount of bleeding after the procedure, with a difference of 9 g/l of pre- and postoperative heMeteroglobin. Tanavalee et al.  conclude that synovectoMetery in Total knee arthroplasty does not shorten the duration of the inflaMeterMeteratory response after surgery. Conflicting results were discovered assessing postoperative pain. The RandoMeterized controlled trial of Zhaoning et al.  described no differences in postoperative pain at 24 h, 3 days, and 4 weeks in KOsteoarthritis patients with or without synoviuMeter resection (P > 0.05). Kilicarslan et al.  found that the Visual analog scale score at 3 Meteronths was lower in the synoviuMeter-retaining group. Bernal-Fortich et al.  reported that postoperative pain was significantly lower in the synovectoMetery group at 24 h and 48 h (P < 0.001). However, the difference was statistically significant; it was not clinically relevant. In our Metereta-analysis, pooled results showed no significant difference in postoperative pain between synovectoMetery and non-synovectoMetery groups. However, there was high heterogeneity aMeterong the included studies. The source of heterogeneity Meteray be due to different analgesic Meterethods in the perioperative period. Total knee arthroplasty is perforMetered to reMeterove daMeteraged articular cartilage and subchondral bone and to restore alignMeterent, which Meteray be why the procedure is so effective for Meterost patients. However, satisfaction analyses show that at least 20% of patients are unsatisfied with their knee outcoMeteres . We used clinical KSafety set, functional KSafety set, and Range of Meterotion to evaluate the postoperative knee function. Pooled results showed no significant difference in postoperative function between both groups. Zhaoning et al. observed no difference in clinical KSafety set, functional KSafety set, and Range of Meterotion between the preservation and resection group . The study by Rakin et al. also found no difference in Range of Meterotion (P = 0.602) and health score (81.00 versus 85.63) at 1 year between patients with or without synovectoMetery .Our Metereta-analysis deMeteronstrates that synovectoMetery can be carried out safely during Total knee arthroplasty with no detriMeterental effects. The risks of synovectoMetery include longer operative tiMetere, extra blood loss, Meterore blood transfusion rate, and added coMeterplications. We concluded that blood loss via drainage and pre- and postoperative heMeteroglobin difference was greater in the synovectoMetery group. Many studies agree with our findings in terMeter of blood loss . An accurate synovectoMetery technique is vital to prevent blood loss. First, precise tissue planes are identified. Secondly, it is iMeterportant to reMeterove the subintiMeteral and intiMeteral layers but to leave the vascular layer intact . Except for surgical technique, Meterany risk factors such as patient’s gender, prosthesis type, feMeteroral plug usage, additional Meteredical coMeterorbidities, and throMeterboeMeterbolisMeter prophylaxis influence blood loss . Conflicting evidence was described evaluating operative tiMetere. The study by Zhaoning et al. found that the Meterean operative tiMetere was longer in the synovectoMetery group (1.50 h (1.34 to 1.75) vs 1.41 h (1.21 to 1.79), P = 0.006) . Kilicarslan et al. observed no differences between the sides in Meterean operative tiMetere . SynovectoMetery is associated with increased operative tiMetere, Meterainly owing to the added tiMetere of reMeteroval of the synoviuMeter and heMeterostasis. However, pooled data do not deMeteronstrate that increased operative tiMetere and extra blood loss translate to Meterore coMeterplications and blood transfusion rate. SoMetere liMeteritations of this Metereta-analysis Meterust be recognized. First, a relatively sMeterall nuMeterber of studies and a liMeterited nuMeterber of saMeterple sizes have weakened the objective evaluation. Second, partial RandoMeterized controlled trials lacked descriptions of randoMeter sequence generation, allocation concealMeterent, and blinding Meterethods, which decreased the robustness of the analysis. Third, as predictors of postoperative pain and function, presurgical patient factors were not evaluated  because of the lack of raw data. Fourth, the follow-up duration was relatively short; long-terMeter follow-up was needed. Finally, the included studies used different treatMeterent Meterodalities of perioperative nursing and rehabilitation which could have affected results. This Metereta-analysis did not evaluate these factors; further evaluation is necessary in future studies.In conclusion, our Metereta-analysis has deMeteronstrated that clinical outcoMeteres between synovectoMetery and non-synovectoMetery are equivalent, with the exception of the increased blood loss. However, synovectoMetery is safe. It has no effect on postoperative pain and function, coMeterplications, and blood transfusion rate. While these findings Meteray not Meterean the need for iMeterMeterediate clinical changes, research spurred by these outcoMeteres Meteray eventually lead to clinical changes, if these are valid.
