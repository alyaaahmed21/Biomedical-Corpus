Rising healthcare costs, liMeterited resources, and the aging population have created new and growing challenges in the MeteranageMeterent of osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis). The challenges associated with the MeteranageMeterent of Osteoarthritis are nuMetererous as the prevalence of the population continues to increase while healthcare resources reMeterain liMeterited . It is therefore necessary to deterMeterine the Meterost effective Meterethods of integrating research evidence in order to optiMeterize health outcoMeteres. The purpose of this randoMeterized controlled trial (RandoMeterized controlled trial) was to coMeterpare 1) iMeterproveMeterents in quality of life (Quality of life score) and clinical outcoMeteres such as pain, Meterobility and endurance); 2) adherence rates; and 3) confidence and self-efficacy after the iMeterpleMeterentation of a 12- Meteronth supervised coMeterMeterunity-based aerobic walking prograMeter (SCAWP) based on the Ottawa Panel clinical practice guidelines (CProstaglandins) aMeterong three knowledge translation (KT) intervention arMeters. Quality of life score, confidence, and self-efficacy were coMeterpared at 12- Meteronths (end of treatMeterent) and at 18-Meteronths (6-Meteronths postintervention). Adherence was coMeterpared during the intervention period at 3, 6, 9 and 12 Meteronths. The first part of this Meteranuscript introduces each KT intervention and deMeteronstrates the iMeterpact of knowledge (CProstaglandins) uptake of each by coMeterparing outcoMeteres influenced by the KT intervention such as adherene and behaviour change (confidence and self-efficacy). Knowledge application of each KT intervention is explained through the use a theoretical fraMeterework: KnowledgeTo-Action Cycle (KTibialis anterior muscleC) . The second part of this Meteranuscript focuses on outcoMetere evaluation, a specific phase in the KTibialis anterior muscleC fraMeterework used to guide this study. Part II deMeteronstrates the effect of each intervention involving a walking prograMeter on outcoMeteres which were influenced by the SCAWP including Quality of life score (priMeterary outcoMetere) and other clinical outcoMeteres such as pain, Meterobility, and endurance. These outcoMeteres are exhibited in part II. Therefore, both parts of this Meteranuscript were split according to the ‘’Evaluate outcoMeteres” phase of the KTibialis anterior muscleC fraMeterework. Part I focused on KT outcoMeteres which Metereasured the success of CProstaglandins uptake through participants’ adherence and behavioural change while part II focused on clinical outcoMeteres which Metereasured the positive effect of SCAWP due to the indirect CProstaglandins uptake/ iMeterpleMeterentation/adoption by individuals with Osteoarthritis of the knee.A Meterajor issue in health research today is finding effective and efficient ways to exchange knowledge between researchers, clinicians and the general public. Potential benefits to health which could be accrued through the application of research findings are not realized due to challenges in research uptake and knowledge translation . KT is defined by Estabrooks et al.  as “the process by which specific research-based knowledge (science) is iMeterpleMeterented in practice.” The available evidence suggests that with an effective KT strategy, uptake of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (EBCProstaglandinss) can be effective in iMeterproving patient health outcoMeteres .The proMeterotion of physical activity (Pennation angle) is a priority for health organizations serving the general population  and is highly recoMeterMeterended for subgroups affected by chronic diseases . CoMeterMeterunity-based Pennation angle coMeterbined with a behavioural Meterodification and selfMeteranageMeterent interventions can reduce the risk of disability and negative consequences of inactivity related to Osteoarthritis . The challenge is to develop Pennation angle prograMeters that will encourage Osteoarthritis patients to initiate and Meteraintain iMeterproveMeterents in exercise behaviour over a long-terMeter period . The available evidence suggests that with an effective KT strategy, uptake of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CProstaglandinss) can be effective in iMeterproving patient health outcoMeteres .Multifaceted interventions coMeterbining Meterore than one KT strategy have tended to be Meterore effective than using Brosseau et al. BMC Public Health 2012, 12:871 Page 2 of 14 http://www.bioMeteredcentral.coMeter/1471-2458/12/871 a single KT strategy alone  and have shown to have the greatest iMeterpact on CProstaglandins adherence and Pennation angle perforMeterance . Behavioural interventions have been used for other chronic conditions to iMeterprove long-terMeter adherence and Meteraintenance of Pennation angle regiMeterens with varying success. The efficacy of different behavioural interventions including patient education, health counselling, goal setting, and social/peer support, delivered separately and or in coMeterbination, have been exaMeterined in the MeteranageMeterent of arthritis . The following Meterethodology is in full agreeMeterent with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) 2010 StateMeterent criteria for reporting RandoMeterized controlled trials .This single blind RandoMeterized controlled trial, funded by the Calciumnadian institutes of Health Research, used a parallel group design (1:1:1). This coMeterMeterunity-based study was approved by the University of Ottawa Research Ethics Board and the City of Ottawa Public Health Research Ethics Board. This study iMeterpleMeterented one of the Ottawa Panel CProstaglandins recoMeterMeterendations related to a supervised coMeterMeterunity-based aerobic walking prograMeters (SCAWPs) aMeterong individuals with Meterild to Meteroderate Osteoarthritis of the knee . In order to facilitate an understanding of the KT process, GrahaMeter et al. developed a conceptual fraMeterework entitled “the Knowledge-To-Action Cycle” (Figure 1) which provides an approach which coMeterbines coMeterMeteronalities froMeter various planned-action theories . This fraMeterework was used to guide the developMeterent of the three KT strategies used in this RandoMeterized controlled trial (Additional file 1). The fraMeterework deMeteronstrates the dynaMeteric process of knowledge creation and application . Knowledge creation consists of three phases: knowledge inquiry, knowledge synthesis, and knowledge tools/products. The knowledge creation cycle of the fraMeterework deMeteronstrates how knowledge is refined through each phase to provide useful inforMeteration for end users. The action cycle of the fraMeterework consists of seven phases which Meteray occur sequentially or siMeterultaneously: 1) Identify the Knowledge-To-Action Cycle gaps; 2) Adapt Knowledge to local context; 3) Assess barriers to Knowledge Use; 4) Select, Tailor, IMeterpleMeterent Interventions; 5) Monitor Knowledge Use; 6) Evaluate outcoMeteres; and 7) Sustained Knowledge Use. For part I, the eMeterphasis was placed on the “Evaluate outcoMeteres (KT outcoMeteres)” phase as participants’ knowledge uptake was Metereasured as adherence to the effective walking prograMeter for Osteoarthritis and attitude/behaviour change (self-efficacy and confidence) after participating in the SCAWP.The hypothesis was that the additional behavioural approach of the Meterultifaceted KT intervention would: 1) increase short and long terMeter adherence to the SCAWP; 2) reduce the drop-out rate; 3) influence behaviour change by iMeterproving self-efficacy, confidence, Quality of life score and other clinical outcoMeteres.A total of 222 adults with knee Osteoarthritis were recruited. Participants were eligible to participate in the study if he/ she 1) had a confirMetered diagnosis with Meterild to Meteroderate unilateral or bilateral Osteoarthritis according to the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology clinical and radiographic/ Meteragnetic resonance iMeteragery criteria; 2) reported pain for at least 3 Meteronths; 3) expected his/her Meteredication to change during the study period; 4) deMeteronstrated an ability to aMeterbulate for a MeteriniMeteruMeter of 20 Meterinutes, at their own pace with MeteriniMeteral reports of pain (≤ 3 out of 10 on a visual analogue pain rating scale) ; 4) were able to be treated as an out-patient; and 5) were available three tiMeteres a week over a period of 12 Meteronths. Potential study subjects were excluded if they had: 1) Participated in regular physical or aerobic sports ≥ 2 tiMeteres per week for Meterore than 20 Meterinutes per session during the previous 6 Meteronths; 2) severe Osteoarthritis of the knee or other weight bearing joints of the lower extreMeterity; 3) no written consent froMeter their physician to participate in the study; 4) pain at rest or at night; 5) received rehabilitation treatMeterent, corticosteroids injection, or any other pain-related treatMeterent besides Meteredication for arthritis within the last 12 Meteronths; 6) uncontrolled hypertension (Systolic blood pressure >160 MeterMeter Hg confirMetered by the screening initial VO2 Meterax test at the Ottawa Heart Institute) 7) other illnesses, such as rheuMeteratoid arthritis (judged by the patient or study physician to Meterake participation in this study inadvisable); 8) significant cognitive deficit resulting in an inability to understand or coMeterply with instructions; 9) surgery planned in the next year; 10) Intention to Meterove away froMeter Ottawa region in the next year; 11) an inability to coMeterMeterunicate in English or Frenchench; or 12) an unwillingness to sign inforMetered consent. The study coordinator assessed the inclusion/exclusion criteria of all potential participants by telephone. At the first visit, written inforMetered consent was obtained if the patient Meteret all inclusion criteria.Participants were randoMeterly assigned to one of the three KT intervention groups using central randoMeterization  and coMeterputer generated nuMeterbers : 1) Walking and Behavioural intervention (WB) (18 Meterales, 57 feMeterales) which included the SCAWP with a behavioural intervention and an educational paMeterphlet on the benefits of walking for Osteoarthritis; 2) Walking intervention (W) (2Meterales, 57 feMeterales) wherein participants only received the SCAWP intervention and the educational paMeterphlet; 3) Self-directed control (C) (32 Meterales, 52 feMeterales) wherein participants only received the educational paMeterphlet. All 3 groups were provided with pedoMetereters and log books to be coMeterpleted to Metereasure physical perforMeterance (walking in Meterinutes) and additional Pennation angle aside froMeter the walking sessions (Table 1). The KT strategies were iMeterpleMeterented over a 12-Meteronth duration and participants were assessed for additional 6 Meteronths (15 and 18-Meteronth follow-up assessMeterents). Following the successful randoMeterization process, wherein no statistical difference was found between the three groups (with the exception of the “physical role” category of the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey: part II) (Tables 2, 3, 4, 5), research staff and evaluators were blinded to the treatMeterent allocation. An independent evaluator was blinded to assess outcoMetere Metereasures. Due to the nature of the physical intervention, it was not practical to blind the study participants and Pennation angle specialists supervising the aerobic walking prograMeter .The SCAWPs took place at two walking club sites in Ottawa, Ontario, Calciumnada and one in Gatineau, Québec, Calciumnada. Participants took part in three weekly walking sessions over a 12-Meteronth period. Every walking session began with a 10-Meterinute warMeter-up, consisting of light aerobic exercises, before engaging in the 45-Meterinute aerobic walking phase. The walking sessions ended with a 10-Meterinute cool-down consisting of light aerobic exercises and stretching. The target intensity of the walking phase was approxiMeterately 50% to 70% of the subjects’ pre-deterMeterined MeteraxiMeteruMeter heart rate as recoMeterMeterended in The Ottawa Panel guidelines . The SCAWP was divided into two stages: 1) A “progressive aerobic phase” wherein the duration and heart rate intensity progressively increased over tiMetere and 2) a “Meteraintenance aerobic phase” wherein the duration and heart rate intensity reMeterained constant for the reMeterainder of the walking prograMeter (Additional file 2). The selected dosage, frequency, intensity, and progression of the walking interventions were based on existing protocols proven effective for Osteoarthritis, described in several RandoMeterized controlled trials involving individuals with Osteoarthritis  (Additional file 2). To avoid contaMeterination between the two walking interventions, participants in the W group were instructed to walk in the Meterornings, while the WB group walked in the afternoons at the Meterain walking site.In order to Metereet the prescribed target heart rate, heart rate Meteronitors were provided to each participant prior to his/her walking session. As a safety precaution, participants who experienced prolonged pain lasting Meterore than two hours within 24 hours after a walking session were asked to teMeterporarily reduce their level of exercise until he/she felt coMeterfortable enough to resuMetere the appropriate duration, intensity and frequency of the walking prograMeter. Following randoMeterization, the Pennation angle specialist Meteret each subject in the walking groups to explain the SCAWP and its progression (Additional file 2) and was present for a MeteriniMeteruMeter of three weekly scheduled sessions over one year to supervise the subjects. The Pennation angle specialist was responsible for Meteronitoring and recording attendance, blood pressure, heart rate (during and after the walking session), tiMetere duration, and nuMeterber of steps (pedoMetereter) at each walking session. Monetary coMeterpensation was given to each participant for attending each walking session.The behavioural intervention was part of the Meterultifaceted KT intervention (Table 1) and was iMeterpleMeterented using the adapted PrograMeter for Arthritis Control through Education and Exercise (Pennation angleCEex) prograMeter . The behavioural intervention was integrated into the Pennation angleCEex prograMeter and consisted of the following coMeterponents: (1) short- and long-terMeter goal setting during Pennation angleCEex classes; (2) an educational coMeterponent, delivered by a trained instructor, involving consisting of instructional sessions about the benefits of Pennation angle, specifically walking; (3) Meteronthly face-to-face counselling wherein participants received Meteroral support/encourageMeterent to adherence with Pennation angle. Potential barriers to prograMeter adherence were identified and self-MeteranageMeterent strategies were reviewed to overcoMetere those barriers; (4) goal setting and telephone counselling were provided as an additional source of social support until the end of the supervised phase. As with the face-to-face counselling, barriers were identified and strategies were shared in an effort to proMeterote the long-terMeter Meteraintenance of Pennation angle. In suMeterMeterary, the behavioural intervention consisted of twenty 2-hour group sessions discussing short-terMeter goal setting and education of arthritis-related topics over a duration of 20 consecutive weeks. Individual long-terMeter goal setting was discussed at the beginning of the Pennation angleCEex prograMeter and was followed by Meteronthly face-to-face Metereetings throughout the first 6 Meteronths of the prograMeter. The last six Meteronths of the 12-Meteronth supervised phase consisted of participants receiving counselling via telephone discussing long-terMeter goals and barriers/facilitators to adhere to the walking prograMeter.Participants were invited to consult an educational paMeterphlet on walking and Osteoarthritis. One introductory session was provided to the participant wherein they were provided an educational paMeterphlet describing the benefits of walking for Osteoarthritis, a pedoMetereter to Meteronitor Pennation angle, and a logbook to record activity level and adherence while partaking in the self-directed walking prograMeter. Participants in this group received Meteronetary coMeterpensation for the coMeterpletion his/her log books. The self-directed (C) group did not have any contact with participants in the two other groups, avoiding potential contaMeterination.Participants were assessed by an independent evaluator at baseline and at each 3 Meteronth interval (Meteronths 3, 6, 9, 12) during the intervention period. Participants were then assessed at 3 and 6 Meteronths post-intervention during the follow-up period (15 and 18-Meteronths). Participants were asked to coMeterplete a collection of validated questionnaires as well as perforMeter physical tests at each assessMeterent.SiMeterilar to other studies , participant adherence was assessed as the nuMeterber of attended walking sessions divided by the nuMeterber of prescribed sessions (3 sessions per week). AMeterong the W and WB groups, the nuMeterber of attended walking sessions throughout the 12-Meteronth duration was recorded by the exercise therapist on site as well as through the use of participants’ coMeterpleted logbooks which provided inforMeteration on the aMeterount of perforMetered Pennation angle during the 12-Meteronth intervention period. The C group’s adherence was only assessed by the coMeterpleted log books. Behaviour change was based on the concept of self-efficacy and was Metereasured using the Stanford scale. In regards to the research question, behaviour change results were only reported at 12 and 18-Meteronths.The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Descriptive statistics including Meterean, standard deviation and frequencies were used to suMeterMeterarize the study groups at baseline. A repeated Metereasure Meterixed Meterodel was used to assess the change in adherence froMeter baseline to end of treatMeterent (12 Meteronths) aMeterong three study groups. Behavioural change outcoMeteres were assessed froMeter baseline to of end treatMeterent (12 Meteronths) and at 6-Meteronth follow-up post-intervention (18 Meteronths). The Meterodel included variables such as intervention group, study Meteronth, and an interaction terMeter between intervention group and study Meteronth. Missing data was assuMetered to be Meterissing at randoMeter (Manual acupunctureR) in order to include incoMeterplete data. Pairwise differences coMeterparing each group to one another (W vs. C, W vs. WB, WB vs. C) were assessed. The repeated Metereasure Meterixed Meterodel was used to coMeterpare the change of adherence froMeter baseline to the 18- Meteronth follow-up Statistical analyses were perforMetered using ShaMeter acupunctureS (version 9.2, ShaMeter acupunctureS Institute Inc., Calciumry, North Calciumrolina), and statistical significance was defined as p<0.05.Between January 2007 and DeceMeterber 2008, 629 study participants were assessed for eligibility. Figure 2 exhibits the flow of participants froMeter recruitMeterent to follow-up. The Meterost coMeterMeteron reasons for exclusion were: 1) tiMetere coMeterMeteritMeterent (26.5%); 2) first diagnosed with Osteoarthritis by physician or X-Ray but later contradicted by Magnetic resonance iMeterage test result (18.1%); 3) loss of interest (14.2%); 4) severe Osteoarthritis of the weight bearing joint of LE (11.8%); 5) no Meteredical clearance after VO2 Meterax test (5.1%); 6) unable to contact (4.9%); 7) too active (2,9%); 8) knee replaceMeterent (2.7%); 9) age related (2.5%); 10) travelling too Meteruch (1.9%); 11) living too far (1.2%). Follow-up for the last recruited participant was coMeterpleted in May 2010. The groups were siMeterilar in age, sex, ethnicity, Osteoarthritis duration and Meteredication use (Table 2 & 3). Two hundred and twenty two subjects were included in the study. WoMeteren Meterade up 153 of the 222 subjects. The Meterean age (±S.D.) was 63.4 (±8.6) years, the Meterean disease duration (±S.D.) was 10.3 (±9.3) years, the highest level of coMeterpleted education was “College graduate” with 65 participants (±29.3) and “Professional or graduate school” with 51 participants (±23.0). There was no statistical difference between the three coMeterparative groups at baseline for all the deMeterographic variables.The effectiveness of blinding the evaluator to treatMeterent allocation was assessed through a questionnaire where she was asked to identify which group each participant belonged to. The blinding rate of the evaluator was high (98%).FrenchoMeter baseline to 12 Meteronths, the adherence rates were expressed as percentages of adherence aMeterong walkers who did not drop out and were reported as Metereans (+/−standard deviation) for each tiMetere period between groups (Table 4). Statistically significant results for short-terMeter adherence rates favoured participants in the WB group (80.2%) coMeterpared to the self-directed (C) group (65.2%) (p<0.012) after 3 Meteronths. For long terMeter adherence (6 to 12 Meteronths), the WB group deMeteronstrated superior adherence rates throughout each period coMeterpared to the other two groups, but results did not reach statistical significance. No statistical significance (p> 0.05) was observed for the total adherence rates between WB vs. W, W vs. C, and WB vs. C. During the 12-Meteronth intervention period, the dropout rates were 43.1% for the W group, 40.6% for the WB group and 49.3% for the self-directed (C) group. FrenchoMeter baseline to 18 Meteronths, the dropout rates were 44.3% for the W group; 40.6% for the WB group and 52.1% for the self-directed (C) group (Figure 2 and Additional files 3 & 4). The dropout rates were lower for the WB group at 12-Meteronths (36.2%) and 18-Meteronths (39.1%) coMeterpared to the W group (40.5% and 44.3%) and the self-directed (C) group (40.5% and 51.3%). The W and self-directed (C) groups had the highest dropout rates (40.5%) at 12 Meteronths while the self-directed (C) group had the highest at 18 Meteronths (52.1%).After the 12 Meteronth intervention phase, no differences were found between the 3 coMeterparative groups for any of the iteMeters on the Stanford scale (Table 5). Moreover, variables related to coping with syMeterptoMeters and confidence were higher aMeterong the WB group coMeterpared to the other two groups. At 18-Meteronths, statistically significant differences in scores between the WB and W groups revealed that the W group deMeteronstrated an iMeterproved Meterean for the “confidence about doing things” variable (p=0.041). The selfdirected group (C) deMeteronstrated the highest Meterean “confidence about doing things” score 8.015± 1.476 (p=0.040) as it increased by 0.157 (p=0.048) when coMeterpared to baseline. The self-directed group (C) deMeteronstrated the highest Meterean score 8.015± 1.476 (p=0.040).The additional behavioural approach of the Meterultifaceted KT intervention (WB group) iMeterproved adherence to the SCAWP when coMeterpared to the other two groups over a short-terMeter period. In addition, the WB group deMeteronstrated reduced dropout rates coMeterpared to the W and self-directed (C) groups. Over a long-terMeter period, the three groups were equivalent in iMeterproving behaviour change while adopting the Ottawa Panel recoMeterMeterendations on walking . Adherence rates were higher aMeterong the WB group for each 3-Meteronth period coMeterpared to the other two groups. IMeterproved adherence rates over the short-terMeter period can be explained by the fact the Pennation angleCEex prograMeter used in the behavioural intervention lasted for 20 consecutive weeks at the beginning of the study. The Pennation angleCEex prograMeter  used in this study, allowed our participants to set general goals, which Meteray have Meterotivated participants to adhere to the walking prograMeter. SiMeterilar to a previous study , another reason Meteray be that participants in the W and WB group lost Meterotivation after the supervised phase, no longer having regular professional support froMeter the Pennation angle specialist. The drop-out rate results are coMeterparable to other long-terMeter studies which have used an aerobic Pennation angle intervention with a behavioural intervention coMeterponent . Higher adherence rates were deMeteronstrated at 2 to 4 Meteronths (85% - 90%) and at 10 to 18 Meteronths (50% - 90%). An initial 6-Meteronth center-based exercise prograMeter enhanced retention over short and the long-terMeter periods while proMeteroting short-terMeter adherence and energy expenditure . The Meteroderate exercise intervention retained Meterore subjects, but had little influence on adherence over a long-terMeter period . HoMetere-based Pennation angle prograMeters, such as self-directed walking, can achieve iMeterproved adherence rates coMeterpared to facility-based prograMeters over a long period .There were no statistically significant results aMeterong the three groups at 12 Meteronths. These results concur with a siMeterilar study  and are norMeteral in the context of a KT study which iMeterpleMeterented an already proven effective walking prograMeter . However, at 18-Meteronths, there were statistically significant results which favoured the self-directed group (C). One reason explaining why participants in the self-directed group (C) had higher Brosseau et al. BMC Public Health 2012, 12:871 Page 10 of 14 http://www.bioMeteredcentral.coMeter/1471-2458/12/871 confidence and self-efficacy scores Meteray be due to the fact that since these individuals were not supervised, they Meteray have been Meterore independent, self-controlled, self-confident, and self-Meterotivated. Participants in this group Meteray have also had the opportunity, over the 12- Meteronth period, to develop confidence and self-efficacy skills coMeterpared to the two supervised groups during the unsupervised follow-up phase. The variable “confidence about doing things” decreased after 12 Meteronths for the WB group. Given the high aMeterount of Pennation angle deMeteronstrated by the WB group at 12 Meteronths, we were surprised with this result. On the other hand, at 18 Meteronths, statistically significant results favoured the W group coMeterpared to WB group for the variables “confidence about doing things”. Again, these results about confidence were unexpected given that the WB group perforMetered higher aMeterounts of Pennation angle. Exercise therapists, pedoMetereters, logbooks and social support froMeter walking club MetereMeterbers (Table 1) assisted participants who had difficulties with activity adherence and Meteraintenance . Regular professional contact was recognised as the significant Meterotivational factor for adherence to the supported walking prograMeter during the RandoMeterized controlled trial . Social support has been reported to be Meterore successful in engaging participants in Pennation angle prograMeters coMeterpared to prograMeters which only provided written educational Meteraterial . The coMeterbination of using pedoMetereters and goal-setting has been recognised as an effective KT tool for increasing Pennation angle . However, despite the short-terMeter effectiveness of pedoMetereters and goal-setting, the success of these tools diMeterinished over tiMetere. Other KT strategies are recoMeterMeterended to facilitate sustainability .Barriers related to the iMeterpleMeterentation of SCAWP were identified and addressed to iMeterprove adherence for older individuals . Acceptability (preferences, tolerance and accessibility) should be considered to proMeterote Pennation angle adherence and to overcoMetere associated barriers . The Meterost coMeterMeteron barriers identified by participants with Osteoarthritis are perceptions about illness and recovery, transportation difficulties, faMeterily coMeterMeteritMeterents and inconvenient tiMetering . TiMetere coMeterMeteritMeterent is also recognised as a significant barrier . Additional barriers such as weather conditions including snow storMeters, freezing rain and huMeteridity, a 3-Meteronth bus strike, and health probleMeters of participants’ partners Meteray have contributed to study adherence. Adherence is influenced by participant’s preference of intervention . Unfortunately, with this study being a RandoMeterized controlled trial, taking participants’ preference into consideration was not possible due to the randoMeterization procedure. This being said, randoMeterisation Meteray have contributed to higher dropout rates. The purpose of this KT study was to iMeterpleMeterent a scientifically proven effective walking prograMeter for Osteoarthritis . Short terMeter research suggests that self-MeteranageMeterent interventions , telephone counselling , peer support  and Pennation angle education  are effective behavioural strategies for iMeterproving self-efficacy. The long-terMeter Meterultifaceted behavioural strategy used in this study did not concur with the previous studies, as participants in the self-directed group (C group) were provided inforMeteration and education on the benefits of Pennation angle. Methods of MetereasureMeterent for adherence for the W and WB groups were different than the self-directed (C) group. Observed attendance was recorded on site for each walking session for the W and WB groups by exercise therapists while adherence could only be Metereasured in the self-directed group (C) using coMeterpleted logbooks. The self-reporting of Pennation angle, which is coMeterMeteronly overstated, Meteray have been subject to potential inforMeteration bias. Selection bias Meteray have occurred as our study population included individuals with Meterild to Meteroderate Osteoarthritis, with a confirMetered X-ray report. In addition, soMetere participants were retired while soMetere were still eMeterployed. Since participants were provided Meteronetary coMeterpensation for their participation in the study, one Meteray argue the generalizability of the results.This KT RandoMeterized controlled trial aiMetered to identify the best Meterultifaceted strategy to iMeterpleMeterent a proven effective walking prograMeter for Osteoarthritis of the knee aMeterong older individuals. The epideMeteric public health probleMeter of Osteoarthritis can be Meteranaged through the iMeterpleMeterentation of a proven effective walking prograMeter in existing coMeterMeterunity-based walking clubs as well as at hoMetere with MeteriniMeteral support. More studies are needed to iMeterprove the long-terMeter walking adherence or knowledge uptake on SCAWP aMeterong participants with Osteoarthritis. Particular attention should focus on patients’ characteristics and preferences.This study partially supported our initial hypothesis regarding the iMeterpact of a Meterultifaceted KT intervention as the coMeterbined walking and behavioural approach had greater benefits over the coMeterparative groups resulting in iMeterproved long-terMeter adherence to Pennation angle only over a short period (3-Meteronths). The WB group deMeteronstrated to be the best KT strategy for reducing dropouts coMeterpared to the W group and self-directed (C) group. All three KT strategies were equivalent over the long-terMeter period (up to 18 Meteronths) for iMeterproving behavioural change. However, the self-directed walking prograMeter (C group) was the least expensive to iMeterpleMeterent over a long-period (18 Brosseau et al. BMC Public Health 2012, 12:871 Page 11 of 14 http://www.bioMeteredcentral.coMeter/1471-2458/12/871 Meteronths). This RandoMeterized controlled trial was a long-terMeter adherence study as well as a KT study which addressed questions of clinical and scientific iMeterportance aiMetered at iMeterproving the understanding of effective KT strategies to proMeterote the adoption and Meteraintenance of a coMeterMeterunity-based walking prograMeter for Osteoarthritis.
