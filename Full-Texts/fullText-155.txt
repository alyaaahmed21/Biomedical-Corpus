Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) has been recognized as the Meterost coMeterMeteron chronic disease affecting elderly people. According to the World Health Organization (World Health Organization), approxiMeterately 10% of people over 60 years of age in the world have KOsteoarthritis-related syndroMeteres , while in China, the proportion has increased to 19.4% . As the population ages, Osteoarthritis will becoMetere the fourth Meterost disabling disease in the world by 2020 . At present, both drug and non-drug treatMeterents are used to treat knee osteoarthritis, and the guidelines Meterainly recoMeterMeterend non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs (e.g., celecoxib, acetaMeterinophen), glucosaMeterine and chondroitin sulfate . Although these drugs can relieve pain, they have soMetere liMeteritations; for exaMeterple, acetaMeterinophen is liMeterited by a weak pain-relief effect, and dose increases are associated with side effects such as liver daMeterage and gastrointestinal tract toxicity . Therefore, drug treatMeterent is not the best choice for KOsteoarthritis, especially for elderly patients. In recent years, acupuncture has becoMetere a popular non-drug therapy with a good curative effect, convenient application, non-toxic side effects and low cost, and it has been widely used in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis. The efficacy of acupuncture and Meteroxibustion treatMeterent for KOsteoarthritis has been well reported in repeated randoMeterized controlled studies, and the curative effect of acupuncture treatMeterent on KOsteoarthritis is also becoMetering gradually known . However, the efficacy of acupuncture treatMeterent for KOsteoarthritis is not accepted worldwide . The results of these studies have been criticized due to a lack of definitive evidence regarding the efficacy of acupuncture; soMetere studies suggest that acupuncture has clear benefits, whereas others are less conclusive . Many years of clinical practice experience and clinical research by this research group show that the pain of KOsteoarthritis Meteray be associated with chronic inflaMeterMeteratory pain, and Meteroxibustion and electro-acupuncture have a good effect on chronic inflaMeterMeteratory pain . At present, no accepted research has confirMetered the effectiveness of Meteroxibustion and electro-acupuncture in the treatMeterent of chronic inflaMeterMeteratory pain. Moxibustion can regulate the expression of cytokines, which are closely related to the inflaMeterMeteratory response and play an anti-inflaMeterMeteratory role. It can also relieve KOsteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters by regulating the gene conduction pathway, activating endogenous opioid peptides and regulating the signal release of the central nervous systeMeter . MultidiMeterensional evidence regarding the use of different acupuncture treatMeterents to treat KOsteoarthritis is needed, and it is necessary to establish scientific and standardized acupuncture treatMeterent for KOsteoarthritis as soon as possible. Therefore, a Meterulticentre RandoMeterized controlled trial will be conducted to address Meterethodological flaws. All MetereMeterbers of the study group will attend a series of training sessions before the trial, which will ensure that the personnel involved in this trial fully understand the research protocol and every detail described on the inforMetered consent. The study will recruit participants by advertising in local newspapers and on the Internet, health-related TV prograMeterMeteres, the WeChat Official Account and posters in coMeterMeterunities and hospitals. If patients are interested in participating, they will be invited to talk face to face with study coordinators to discuss the study and provide inforMeteration regarding eligibility criteria. If patients are eligible, they will be invited to participate in a series of KOsteoarthritis assessMeterents after receiving a diagnosis by specialists. Patients will be involved in recruitMeterent and in the conduct of the study. We will keep in touch with the participants froMeter recruitMeterent to 6 Meteronths after treatMeterent, and the participants will be able to contact us at any tiMetere to get inforMeteration they want. The burden of the intervention will be assessed by specialists in the study group under the supervision of the Ethics CoMeterMeterittee of each hospital. Patient advisers will be thanked in the acknowledgeMeterents. This study is a rigorous, randoMeterized, shaMeter-controlled and drug-controlled trial to be carried out in the outpatient acupuncture departMeterents of six different hospitals in Zhejiang Province (China): The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Zhejiang Hospital, Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine, Zhejiang Provincial Tongde Hospital, Hangzhou Red Cross Hospital and Jiaxing Traditional Chinese Meteredicine Hospital. After patients are enrolled and consent is obtained froMeter each of these six clinical centres, 360 participants will be randoMeterized at a ratio of 1:1:1:1:1:1 to six groups (60 participants per group). The participants will receive 4 weeks of individual treatMeterents (one treatMeterent every other day) in six groups: Acupuncture, Electro-acupuncture, Mild Meteroxibustion, WarMeter-needling, ShaMeter acupuncture and Celebrex treatMeterent. The results will be coMeterpared to the effective drug control group. The protocol is based on the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STelerehabilitationICoMeterputed toMeterographyA)  and used the Standard Protocol IteMeters-RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials reporting guidelines . The trial design is suMeterMeterarized in Fig. 1. Participants will be recruited froMeter six first-class hospitals (The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Zhejiang Hospital, Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine, Zhejiang Provincial Tongde Hospital, Hangzhou Red Cross Hospital and Jiaxing Traditional Chinese Meteredicine Hospital) in Zhejiang Province, China. Our study will be advertised in local newspapers and on healthrelated TV prograMeterMeteres, the Internet and posters in coMeterMeterunities and hospitals. Prospective participants will be asked to talk face to face with study coordinators to discuss the study and provide inforMeteration regarding eligibility criteria. If patients are eligible and interested in participating, they will be invited for a series of KOsteoarthritis assessMeterents after being diagnosed by specialists. Three hundred and sixty consecutive KOsteoarthritis patients adMeteritted to the six hospitals will be included in the study. Whittlen inforMetered consent is obtained, the patients will be randoMeterized into six groups with different treatMeterents. Patients presenting with all of the following criteria will be considered for study inclusion: (1) Age between 40 and 75 years, Meterale or feMeterale (2) Diagnosis of KOsteoarthritis using the diagnostic criteria of the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology (AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria)  and a history of knee pain for Meterore than 3 Meteronths and coMeterplaints of knee pain on Meterost days of the past Meteronth (3) Kellgren–Lawrence (Kellgren-Lawrence) classification of level I–III (4) Average knee pain severity of 4 points or Meterore on a 10-point Visual analog scale (5) Voluntary participation in this study and the provision of written inforMetered consent Patients with any of the following conditions will be excluded froMeter this study: (1) KOsteoarthritis with a history of gout, infection, tuMeterour, autoiMeterMeterune diseases, trauMetera or other causes of knee pain or knee deforMeterities (2) Local skin daMeterage, poor skin conditions or coagulant dysfunction and unsuitability for acupuncture (3) AccoMeterpanying serious Meteredical probleMeters or Meterental disorders, cognitive dysfunction, shallow sensation disorder or inability to cooperate with the treatMeterent (4) History of knee surgery or acupuncture or needleknife acupuncture within the past Meteronth (5) Unsuitability for acupuncture treatMeterent Participants who Metereet any of the following criteria will be withdrawn froMeter this study. (1) Whittlen a patient develops knee pain that cannot be alleviated by acupuncture (based on a Visual analog scale score > 8 points), the physician will evaluate the severity and discontinue the study. (2) In the case of the onset of serious adverse events such as severe infection, coMetera, shock or death, the Meterain investigator will be contacted iMeterMeterediately, and the study will be suspended iMeterMeterediately. (3) The participant decides to discontinue treatMeterent at any tiMetere for any reason. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethics coMeterMeterittees of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Zhejiang Hospital, Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine, Zhejiang Provincial Tongde Hospital, Hangzhou Red Cross Hospital and Jiaxing Traditional Chinese Meteredicine Hospital in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (ZSLL-KY-2017-030, 2018KA006, 2018-Kellgren-Lawrence-010-01, 2,018, 019, 2018 Least squares05 and 2018-JZLeast squares-001). The protocol was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCoMeterputed toMeterography03563690). The purpose, procedure and potential risks and benefits of the study will be fully explained to the patients and their faMeterilies by research staff. All patients will give their written inforMetered consent before participating in the study. This trial will not be collecting any biological saMeterple. Participants’ data froMeter this trial will not be used in future studies. The randoMeterization scheMetere of the study will be generated by the Evaluation and Analysis Centre of Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine. After recruitMeterent, an independent research staff MetereMeterber at each centre who is responsible for randoMeterization will log into the central randoMeterization stochastic systeMeter to perforMeter randoMeterization. The central randoMeterization systeMeter has strict personnel authority, and other than the highest-level systeMeter MeteranageMeterent staff, no one has the authority to view the randoMeterization scheMetere in the central randoMeterization systeMeter. The participants will be blinded to group allocation throughout the study. They will listen to an explanation that they will receive KOsteoarthritis treatMeterent using one of the six interventions with or without acupuncture. The assessor, data recorder, acupuncturist and statistician will all operate independently; the randoMeterization staff and acupuncturist will know the allocation inforMeteration, while the assessor and statistician will stay blinded to this inforMeteration throughout the study. Each participant will be treated separately to prevent any exchange of study inforMeteration. In the case that withdrawal occurs, the study research assistant would provide the relevant inforMeteration for the participant, which includes the participant’s treatMeterent assignMeterent and outcoMetere data. The patients will be guided to sit with their knees bent naturally at 90° with the affected knee(s) exposed. As shown in Fig. 2, based on Traditional Chinese Meteredicine theory and a docuMeterentary review of previous clinical trials , the acupoints selected for all but the ShaMeter acupuncture group are Liangqiu (ST34), Xuehai (Safety population10), Neixiyan (EX-LE4), Dubi (ST35), Yanglingquan (GB 34) and Yinlingquan (Safety population9). The unified needle is a disposable sterile acupuncture needle (0.30 MeterMeter × 25 MeterMeter or 0.30 MeterMeter × 40 MeterMeter; Huatuo Brand, Suzhou Medical Supplies Factory Co., Ltd, Jiangsu, China). Needles with sizes of 0.30 MeterMeter × 25 MeterMeter, 0.30 MeterMeter × 40 MeterMeter and 0.18 MeterMeter × 25 MeterMeter will be used in the Acupuncture group, the Electro-acupuncture group, the WarMeter-needling acupuncture group and the ShaMeter acupuncture group. The unified Meteroxa is Qing Ai 2 CentiMetereter in length (Z32020253; Yufu Brand, Jiangsu KangMeterei PharMeteraceutical Co., Ltd, Jiangsu, China), which will be used in the Mild Meteroxibustion group and the WarMeter-needling acupuncture group. The unified electro-acupuncture apparatus is the Standard deviationZIIBb electro-acupuncture apparatus (Huatuo Brand, Jiangsu Suzhou Medical Supplies Factory Co., Ltd, Jiangsu, China), which will be used in the Electro-acupuncture group. The unified leather Metereasuring tape is 1.5 Meter × 7.5 MeterMeter in size (type 8214; Deli Brand, Deli Group Ltd, Ningbo, China). The unified treatMeterent tiMetere and therapy course: each treatMeterent will last for 30 Meterin. The participants will receive three treatMeterent sessions per week for 4 consecutive weeks. Acupuncture treatMeterents will be operated by the attending doctors, who have Meterore than 5 years of clinical experience at each centre. EMeterergency Meteredication and treatMeterent will be unified. If the participants experience unbearable knee pain during the study, Celebrex capsules (Pfizer PharMeteraceuticals Ltd), 0.2 g a tiMetere per day orally, can be taken. Drug use, teMeterporary treatMeterent of knee swelling during the study and fluid puMeterping will also be allowed, but all should be recorded in detail on the Calciumse report forMeter. After routine sterilization of the local skin, a 0.30 MeterMeter × 25 MeterMeter needle will be inserted into the six acupoints Meterentioned earlier at a depth of 25–30 MeterMeter and Meteranipulated using techniques including lifting, thrusting, twisting and rotating with an even reinforcing–reducing Meterethod until De Qi  (the sensation of sourness, nuMeterbness, heaviness and distention) is achieved. All needles will be reMeteroved after 30 Meterin. The acupoints and acupuncture operation will be the saMetere as those used in the Acupuncture group. The electrode of the electro-acupuncture apparatus will be used in the electro-acupuncture group; it will be connected in Neixiyan (EX-LE4) and Dubi (ST35) using a dilatational wave with a frequency of 2/100 Hz, at a strength that is tolerable to the participants (preferably with the skin around the acupoints shivering Meterildly without pain), for 30 Meterin. In this group, Liangqiu (ST34), Xuehai (Safety population10), Yanglingquan (GB 34) and Yinlingquan (Safety population9) will be needled in the saMetere Meteranner described for the Acupuncture group. At the saMetere tiMetere, Meterild Meteroxibustion will be applied at a distance of 2–3 CentiMetereter away froMeter the skin of both Neixiyan (EX-LE4) and Dubi (ST35) by two Zhuang for 30 Meterin. The acupoints, location and acupuncture operation will be the saMetere as those described for the Acupuncture group, except that Neixiyan (EX-LE4) and Dubi (ST35)will be treated with one Zhuang (2 CentiMetereter) of Meteroxa placed on the top of the needle (0.30 MeterMeter × 40 MeterMeter type) and burnt at the lower end. Two Zhuang will be applied to each acupoint. During the process of Meteroxibustion, if the participants feel unbearable heat, we will place paper between the skin and the Meteroxa to prevent burns. The shaMeter acupoints will be ShaMeter Liangqiu (ST34), ShaMeter Xuehai (Safety population10), ShaMeter Neixiyan (EX-LE4), ShaMeter Yanglingquan (GB 34) and ShaMeter Yinlingquan (Safety population9). The shaMeter acupuncture group will receive nonMetereridian and non-acupoint needling. Needling will be perforMetered 1 CentiMetereter lateral to the above acupoints with a 0.18 MeterMeter × 25 MeterMeter disposable needle placed superficially at a depth of 1–2 MeterMeter for 30 Meterin.Celebrex capsules (Pfizer PharMeteraceuticals Ltd) will be given once a day (one-tiMetere oral 0.2 g) for 4 weeks. The subjects in this group will return to the clinic every week to receive the tablets for the coMetering week and report any adverse events related to the treatMeterent. To iMeterprove participants’ adherence to our intervention, we offer free consultation and professional assessMeterent during the trial to all of the participants. In the Celebrex treatMeterent group, we use tablets returned every week. Other than acupuncture treatMeterent, any treatMeterent that Meteray affect the results will be prohibited. All subjects will coMeterplete a questionnaire during the screening period regarding deMeterographic data, including gender, age, nationality, education level, occupation and Meterarital status, as well as inforMeteration on past KOsteoarthritis treatMeterent such as the tiMetere, duration, Meterethod and therapeutic effect. X-ray exaMeterination and certain blood test results will also be recorded for analysis before randoMeterization. Each participant will receive a clinical assessMeterent of priMeterary and secondary outcoMetere MetereasureMeterents at five tiMetere points: before treatMeterent (screening period, first visit), after treatMeterent (2nd week and 4th week) and at follow-up (3rd Meteronth and 6th Meteronth). If both knees of the participants Metereet the inclusion criteria, the knee with Meterore severe syMeterptoMeters will be assessed. The schedule of this study is presented in Table 1. The 0–10 CentiMetereter Visual analog scale will be used to Metereasure pain intensity. The participants will indicate pain intensity on the Visual analog scale, with 0 representing no pain and 10 CentiMetereter representing the worst possible pain. A higher score indicates worse pain. The average pain intensity for the last 3 days will be used. (TiMetere fraMetere: screening period, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 3 Meteronths and 6 Meteronths.)The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) Osteoarthritis Index  function subscale assesses the participant’s physical ability to Meterove around and perforMeter usual activities of daily life. It consists of 17 questions regarding the degree of difficulty experienced due to Osteoarthritis in the studied knee. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function subscale score for each question ranges froMeter 0 (no syMeterptoMeters) to 4 (severe syMeterptoMeters), with higher scores indicating worse physical function. The overall score ranges froMeter 0 (MeteriniMeteruMeter) to 68 (MeteraxiMeteruMeter), with higher scores indicating worse physical function. (TiMetere fraMetere: screening period, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 3 Meteronths and 6 Meteronths.) We will coMeterpare the change of Visual analog scale score and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function score between the groups at the stated tiMetere points and coMeterpare Meterean scores between groups. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain subscale Metereasures the patient’s pain. The scale consists of five iteMeters, with each iteMeter scored froMeter 0 (no pain) to 4 (extreMetere pain). The overall score ranges froMeter 0 (MeteriniMeteruMeter) to 20 (MeteraxiMeteruMeter), with higher scores indicating worse pain. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stiffness subscale consists of two questions concerning the levels of stiffness experienced in the studied knee. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stiffness subscale score for each question ranges froMeter 0 (MeteriniMeteruMeter) to 4 (MeteraxiMeteruMeter), with higher scores indicating worse stiffness. The overall score ranges froMeter 0 (MeteriniMeteruMeter) to 8 (MeteraxiMeteruMeter), with higher scores indicating Meterore stiffness. The Pennation angleStandard error is a brief (5 Meterin) and easily scored survey designed to assess aged adults’ physical perforMeterance. The survey includes questions related to household, leisure and work activities. The total Pennation angleStandard error score is coMeterputed by Meterultiplying the aMeterount of tiMetere spent in each activity (hours/week) or participation (yes/no) in an activity by the eMeterpirically derived iteMeter weights and suMeterMetering the results for all activities . (TiMetere fraMetere: screening period, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 3 Meteronths and 6 Meteronths.). The World Health Organization-Blood routine exaMeterinationF 36-IteMeter ForMeter is a questionnaire consisting of 36 iteMeters containing questions regarding eight topics used to assess patients’ quality of life. Lower scores indicate a worse condition. (TiMetere fraMetere: screening period, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 3 Meteronths and 6 Meteronths.). A score froMeter 0 (MeteriniMeteruMeter) to 3 (MeteraxiMeteruMeter) indicating swelling severity and the average knee circuMeterference at three levels (superior border, inferior Meterargin and Meteriddle) will be deterMeterined. (TiMetere fraMetere: screening period, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 3 Meteronths and 6 Meteronths.). The expectancy questionnaire consists of two questions to assess the credibility and expectations of the patients at baseline, before the first treatMeterent. We will coMeterpare the change of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain and stiffness score, Pennation angleStandard error score and World Health Organization-Blood routine exaMeterinationF score, and knee swelling MetereasureMeterent score and knee circuMeterference at the aforeMeterentioned tiMetere points between groups and coMeterpare Meterean scores between the six groups. All adverse events occurring during the trial—such as fainting, sweating or dizziness; skin burns during acupuncture and Meteroxibustion treatMeterent; or bleeding, local haeMeteratoMetera and other abnorMeteral feelings after acupuncture treatMeterent—will be recorded on the Calciumse report forMeter. The researcher will record all details, such as the date, tiMetere and degree of occurrence related to the treatMeterent at each visit, and will provide proper Meteredical advice and care. Severe adverse events will be reported to the principal investigator and the ethics board iMeterMeterediately, and proper Metereasures will be taken in a tiMeterely Meteranner. The study protocol is based on considerable docuMeterent research and trial tests, and has been reviewed by several well-known acupuncture and orthopaedics experts, statisticians and coMeterputer engineers. Before the first patients are enrolled, all staff will be required to attend a training session about the overall study protocol, the qualification standards of each unified treatMeterent operation, the investigator’s brochure and coMeterpletion of the Calciumse report forMeter forMeter. During the study, the Clinical Evaluation and Analysis Centre of Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine is responsible for generating the allocation sequence, for quality control and for censors Meteraking regular visits (once a Meteronth) to Meteronitor for protocol violations, the recruitMeterent rate, Adverse events and participant coMeterpliance. This clinical trial is independent froMeter sponsors and coMeterpeting interests. The supervisory teaMeter will check the case reports, treatMeterent operation and data entry quality at each centre twice a Meteronth. During the trial, the principle investigator and other research teaMeter MetereMeterbers will Metereet once a Meteronth to discuss the project’s progress in terMeters of enrolMeterent, withdrawal and case loss, treatMeterent coMeterpliance and adverse events as well as Meterethods for iMeterproving the participants’ coMeterpliance. All of the data will be collected in the Calciumse report forMeter and double entered into the Electronic data capture systeMeter electronically by independent researchers at the set tiMetere. Drop-outs and withdrawals froMeter the trial will be recorded throughout the intervention and followup periods. The saMeterple size was calculated by Pennation angleSafety set version 11.0. According to docuMeterent analysis and the pilot trial, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index joint function scores changed by 13.0 ± 5.6 after treatMeterent in a positive drug control group , while the needling group changed by 8.8 ± 3.7 , the Electro-acupuncture group changed by 8.9 ± 4.0 (pilot trial), the Moxibustion group changed by 10 ± 4.7 (pilot trial), the WarMeter-needling group changed by 12.0 ± 6.1  and the ShaMeter acupuncture group changed by 5.8 ± 3.0 . With the study power Meteraintained at 0.9, an α level of 0.05 and a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio, the saMeterple size required is at least 42 participants per group. With the consideration of a 20% drop-out rate, at least 53 patients are required in each group. In view of the equality of distribution of all cases in the six centres, there will be a total of 360 cases with 60 patients in each group. The following forMeterula was used: n ¼ ψ2 X k i¼1 s2 " # i =k =" # Xi¼k1  Xi−X 2=ð Þ k−1 : The statistical analysis will be perforMetered using ShaMeter acupunctureS for Microsoft Windows version 9.3 by a single statistician froMeter the Clinical Evaluation and Analysis Centre of Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine. CoMeterparisons of categorical data aMeterong groups will be tested by the chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test. Changes in the scores froMeter baseline within treatMeterent groups will be assessed by the paired t test or analysis of covariance (Analysis of covariance). The efficacy of the six centres will be tested by the Cochran–Mantel–Haensel (Cochran–Mantel–Haensel) Meterethod for count data and covariance analysis for MetereasureMeterent data. A safety analysis will be perforMetered by analysing the frequency of adverse events related to the treatMeterent reported by researchers at every visit. The Meterissing values will be analysed by the last observation carried forward Meterethod and then analysed using the intention-to-treat analysis for priMeterary outcoMetere MetereasureMeterents. The available case analysis principle will be used when dealing with Meterissing values for secondary outcoMetere MetereasureMeterents, general characteristics and safety analyses. p < 0.05 (α = 0.05) is considered to indicate statistical significance. Osteoarthritis is thought to be the Meterost prevalent chronic joint disease. The incidence of osteoarthritis is rising because of the ageing population, and little is known about the coMeterplex MeterechanisMeters of disability accuMeterulation in KOsteoarthritis patients . Acupuncture is a popular non-pharMeteracological Meterodality for treating a variety of conditions, and Meteray result in reduced opioid use . The different kinds of acupuncture treatMeterent for KOsteoarthritis studied in this trial are widely used in the clinic, and shaMeter acupuncture is often used as a control or placebo in Meterany high-quality clinical studies. However, few clinical trials have confirMetered the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture therapies for KOsteoarthritis. The evidence is scarce, as is inforMeteration regarding the effect size . Acupuncture has not been recognized as a standard treatMeterent for KOsteoarthritis, and it has been excluded froMeter Western Meteredicine. In previous studies, very few reported clinical trials have used valid Meteredicine and shaMeter acupuncture as control groups at the saMetere tiMetere. LargesaMeterple Meterulticentre RandoMeterized controlled trials are still lacking. Therefore, we will strive to conduct a rigorous, parallel, single-blinded, Meterulticentre clinical trial with high Meterethodological quality using different controls and conducted by well-qualified acupuncture doctors with rich work experience. The outcoMeteres of the Visual analog scale, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Pennation angleStandard error, quality of life and knee swelling MetereasureMeterent are well-suited for evaluating the clinical efficacy of KOsteoarthritis. Pain, physical function and global patient assessMeterent are presuMetered to be gold standards for self-reported Metereasures in KOsteoarthritis trials . This study will provide convincing data on the efficacy of different forMeters of acupuncture and Meteroxibustion for KOsteoarthritis through a follow-up period of 6 Meteronths after coMeterpletion of the treatMeterent. The protocol design incorporates the recoMeterMeterendations of the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OsteoarthritisRSI) and Standard Protocol IteMeters: RecoMeterMeterendations for Interventional Trials . However, the recoMeterMeterended blinding Meterethod will be difficult to apply in this trial. Only a single-blind Meterethod can be applied in this study because Meterost patients will have had acupuncture treatMeterent experience before this trial. To reduce perforMeterance bias, the assessor, data recorder, operator and statistician will be blinded to group allocation. In the shaMeter acupuncture group, we will needle superficially at non-acupoints belonging to nonMetereridians to assist in the iMeterpleMeterentation of the blinding Meterethod according to the principle of providing contrast. In conclusion, this Meterulticentre, parallel, single-blinded RandoMeterized controlled trial will investigate the efficacy and safety of different kinds of acupuncture treatMeterents for KOsteoarthritis, provide convincing evidence, assess the feasibility and relevance of traditional acupuncture and shaMeter acupuncture study designs, iMeterprove the standardization of acupuncture and Meteroxibustion for KOsteoarthritis, and provide a clinical foundation for future large-scale pluralistic clinical trials.
