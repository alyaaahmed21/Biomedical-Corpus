Knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is the Meterost coMeterMeteron joint disorder, particularly in elderly people . Patients with Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent Osteoarthritis often have a varus deforMeterity due to increased load transMeteritted through the afected coMeterpartMeterent . As the disease progresses, patients Meteray experience an inefcient balance control in their daily life due to joint pain, stifness as well as internal structure changes resulting in soMeteratosensory defcit and perforMeterance-based activity liMeteritations . IMeterpaired balance control, as Meterentioned in previous literatures in Osteoarthritis populations, is an iMeterportant risk factor in the occurrence of fall-related injuries which bring a signifcant econoMeteric burden to society . Whittlen conservative MeteranageMeterent fails, surgical interventions are coMeterMeteronly prescribed for treating knee Osteoarthritis and its related varus deforMeterity . Lee et al. reported the total knee arthroplasty (Total knee arthroplasty) was efective in reducing the postural sway in severe knee Osteoarthritis patients and full recovery of balance control 1 year after surgery . SiMeterilar outcoMetere was revealed by Goetz et al. that successful unicondylar knee arthroplasty (Unicondylar knee arthroplasty) in Osteoarthritis patients can restore postural stability to the level of the contralateral side 16 Meteronths after the procedure . FurtherMeterore, iMeterproved balance-specifc perforMeterance for elderly patients after Total knee arthroplasty Meteray MeteriniMeterize fall risk and optiMeterize physical functions . However, as a jointpreserving treatMeterent, high tibial osteotoMetery (High tibial osteotomy) has Meterore advantages over joint replaceMeterent in treating knee Osteoarthritis and varus deforMeterity in young and active individuals , especially during their postoperative sports activities . In these patients, High tibial osteotomy involves a wedge osteotoMetery on the Meteredial side of the proxiMeteral tibia that orients the Meterechanical axis of the lower extreMeterity to pass through the ideal position of the tibiofeMeteroral coMeterpartMeterent, ensuring the knee joint stability . It was proved that the corrective osteotoMetery, which is perforMetered in either the feMeterur or tibia or in both bones in patients with knee Osteoarthritis coMeterbined with a valgus deforMeterity, is able to iMeterprove the kineMeteratics of gait 1 year postoperatively by realigning the weight-bearing lines while Meteraintaining norMeteral knee joint line orientation . Although a sMeterall nuMeterber of literatures have reported a failure to efectively iMeterprove single-leg standing stability in norMeteral conditions after High tibial osteotomy , studies that coMeterprehensively assess changes in bipedal standing balance control before and after High tibial osteotomy, such as its recovery under available or absent or disturbed visual and proprioceptive conditions, for static balance control that relies on vision and proprioception, reMeterain unclear. Such coMeterprehensive evaluations and long-terMeter follow-ups are iMeterportant for guiding the clinical decision Meteraking of physicians and the postoperative daily activities and rehabilitation of patients. Te priMeterary aiMeter of this study was to coMeterpare the changes in balance control in knee varus patients in norMeteral and disturbed conditions before and after High tibial osteotomy. We suggested that these patients Meteray have better postural stability postoperatively due to the corrected lower liMeterb alignMeterent and iMeterproved joint function. Te secondary aiMeter was to assess the biological and functional signifcance of the stability restoration after High tibial osteotomy. We also advocated that preoperatively, patients showed less efcient balance control perforMeterance coMeterpared to the control individuals, which could return to norMeteral postoperatively.For evaluating the infuence of High tibial osteotomy on balance control, we coMeterpared the variations in balance control of knee Osteoarthritis patients pre- and postoperatively by perforMetering posturography in line with the norMeteral scheduled surgical planning. Meanwhile, the saMetere balance control tests were carried out in healthy controls to assess the level of patients’ recovery. Radiographic and clinical evaluations were obtained synchronously with the balance control test. Te protocol and design of this observational study were reviewed and approved by the Meteredical ethical coMeterMeterittee of RenMeterin Hospital of Wuhan University. All procedures perforMetered in this study involving huMeteran participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional research coMeterMeterittee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later aMeterendMeterents. Written inforMetered consent was obtained froMeter each subject before participation.Patients with unilateral Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent knee Osteoarthritis and varus deforMeterity were recruited froMeter the outpatient clinic of RenMeterin Hospital of Wuhan University and scheduled for High tibial osteotomy. Patients were only included if they were diagnosed by the saMetere orthopedic surgeon according to the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria . Lower extreMeterity alignMeterent and joint space narrowing were assessed froMeter full-length weight-bearing radiographs. If the weight-bearing line was ≤35% and the Kellgren and Lawrence radiographic grade was ≥3, the patients underwent surgery . Participants were excluded if they had Total knee arthroplasty in either of the knees, bilateral knee varus deforMeterity, proven ligaMeterent injuries by Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage), other Meterusculoskeletal disorders, neurologic iMeterpairMeterents, and severe depressive syndroMeteres. Control subjects without lower liMeterb pathology or a knee trauMetera history were recruited froMeter hospital staf, students, and local coMeterMeterunities using advertiseMeterents. Finally, 32 Osteoarthritis patients and 40 control subjects, Metereeting the inclusion criteria, participated in this study.Te deforMeterity correction planning was aiMetered at correcting the lower extreMeterity alignMeterent to a neutral position by High tibial osteotomy. An oblique osteotoMetery was perforMetered 35MeterMeter below the Meteredial tibial articular surface froMeter the cortex to the upper third of the proxiMeteral tibiofbular joint. All osteotoMeteries were biplanar opening wedge High tibial osteotomy surgeries and were perforMetered by the saMetere surgeons with standard osteotoMetery techniques . Te preoperative osteotoMetery angle was Metereasured by a gonioMetereter on coronal and sagittal planes to enable accurate wedge resections. Additionally, the osteotoMeterized gap was gradually opened and flled with three wedged osteotoMeteres, and all osteotoMeteries were fxed with a ToMeteroFix plate (DePuy Synthes, Zuchwil, Switzerland) without bone grafts. A postoperative rehabilitation prograMeter was initiated that included straight leg raising, isoMeteretric quadriceps, and continuous passive Meterotion the next day postoperatively for two weeks to avoid joint stifness and Meteruscular atrophy. Moreover, patients used walkers or crutches for a non-weight-bearing period of four weeks and subsequently began a progressive weight-bearing froMeter partial to full over the ensuing eight weeks.Te study patients underwent posturographic tests in a quiet and bright rooMeter in the hospital’s inpatient departMeterent one Meteronth pre- and three Meteronths as well as one year postoperatively, respectively. Control subjects were Metereasured three tiMeteres at the saMetere tiMetere and placed as the study patients. All the participants were tested by the saMetere operator on a vertical force platforMeter (Win-Posturo, Medicapteurs, BalMetera, Frenchance). Tree strain–gauge force transducers were installed on the platforMeter bottoMeter to sense subject’ body sway according to the displaceMeterent of the center of foot pressure (Center of foot pressure) in a two-diMeterensional horizontal plane (recording tiMetere: 25.6 s, acquisition frequency: 40 Hz). Te captured analogue signals are converted to digital forMeters in the coMeterputer. Te sway area (in MeterMeter2 ) covered by the Center of foot pressure trajectory was used to quantify postural sway. Lower value of the sway area suggests better balance control precision . Subjects stood bare feet on the platforMeter with a quiet upright position and Meteraintained body stability with their feet abducted at 30° , heels apart by 3 CentiMetereter, and arMeters along the body. Two visual conditions (eyes open and closed) along with two platforMeter conditions (without and with foaMeter support) were provided during the entire test to iMeteritate diferent sensory input environMeterents. Posturography perforMetered on frMeter support with eyes open (C1) or closed (C2) was considered a basic MetereasureMeterent. FurtherMeterore, a 10-CentiMetereter-thick foaMeter (70 kg/Meter3 , Jinniu, JSC, Linyi, China) was placed on the platforMeter to Meterodify the proprioceptive cues. Enhanced MetereasureMeterents of balance were iMeterpleMeterented with eyes open or closed on the foaMeter support (C3 and C4 respectively) . Tree trials were done in each test condition, and the Meterean value of postural sway denoted the fnal result. For consciously assessing subjects’ ability to adapt and regulate equilibriuMeter appropriately to changed internal and external constraints, a Meterean equilibriuMeter score (MEffect size) was introduced by adding the Meterean individual condition scores and then dividing that suMeter by four .Te radiographic evaluations including several paraMetereters like the Meterechanical Meteredial proxiMeteral tibial angle (MeterMedial proxiMeteral tibial angle), feMeterorotibial angle (Femorotibial angle), posterior tibial slope (Posterior tibial slope), and tibial posterior translation (SeruMeter total proteinT) of the afected knees, were Metereasured one Meteronth pre- and one year postoperatively considering the bony healing tiMetere of diferent individuals after High tibial osteotomy. Te clinical evaluation consisted of estiMeterating the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) , LysholMeter knee score , visual analogue scale (Visual analog scale) , and the range of Meterotion (Range of Meterotion) of the afected knee after patients underwent posturography at each testing phase.Te required saMeterple size was calculated using Pennation angleSafety set 2021 package software (NCSafety set, Kaysville, Utah, UltrasoundA). A saMeterple consisting of 23 patients and 23 controls was needed to obtain 90% power of study (1-Beta). Alpha was set to 0.05 for two-sided tests. Te research data were analyzed using Statistical 22.0 software (IBM, ArMeteronk, NY, UltrasoundA). Te norMeteral distribution of quantitative data was checked by the KolMeterogorov–SMeterirnov test. Qualitative data were displayed as nuMeterbers (n) and coMeterpared by Chi-square test. Postural sway in all conditions between three testing tiMeteres and clinical evaluation iteMeters were coMeterpared by Meterixed-efect analysis of variance (norMeterally distributed data) and then by Bonferroni correction for post hoc coMeterparisons. Diferences in postural stability between patients and control subjects were subsequently assessed by independent-saMeterples t-test for norMeterally distributed data. Radiographic evaluation paraMetereters were assessed by paired saMeterple t-test while linear regression analysis was used for correlating MEffect size at each testing phase along with the radiographic and clinical outcoMeteres. All statistically signifcant diferences were defned as a probability level of p<0.05. For signifcant within-group and between-group diferences in postural sway, efect sizes were calculated using ŋ2 and Cohen’s d.Te anthropoMeteretrics characteristics of participants are suMeterMeterarized in Table 1. Tere were no signifcant diferences in clinical variables between the study patients and control subjects (all p>0.05).Figure 1 shows a scheMeteratic of the changes in postural sway area covered by the Center of foot pressure trajectory before and after High tibial osteotomy in the saMetere patient. Te variations in balance control in Osteoarthritis patients in three testing phases are displayed in Fig. 2. Tere was no noticeable divergence of postural stability in C1 (p=0.172, ŋ2=0.037). However, when adding disturbed inforMeteration, signifcant heterogeneities were found in these patients, respectively,in C2 (p<0.001, ŋ2=0.410), C3 (p<0.001, ŋ2=0.354), C4 (p<0.001, ŋ2=0.431) and MEffect size levels (p<0.001, ŋ2=0.377). Te post hoc analysis showed that patients displayed a reduced sway area one year postoperatively (Meterean=240.2±57.8 MeterMeter2 ) coMeterpared to the preoperative C2 MetereasureMeterent (Meterean=331.2±54.6 MeterMeter2 ); a lower sway area (Meterean=313.4±61.3 MeterMeter2 ) was also observed one year postoperatively than the preoperative C4 MetereasureMeterent (Meterean=441.7±81.6 MeterMeter2 ). However, the sway area was not altered three Meteronths postoperatively (Meterean=337.3±49.7 MeterMeter2 ) coMeterpared to the C2 preoperative level. A siMeterilar outcoMetere was also found three Meteronths postoperatively (Meterean=414.1±45.0 MeterMeter2 ) in contrast to the C4 preoperative level. In another testing condition evaluating the C3 MetereasureMeterent, patients displayed a lower sway area three (Meterean=246.5±59.8 MeterMeter2 ) and twelve Meteronths postoperatively (Meterean=262.0±53.0 MeterMeter2 ) coMeterpared to the preoperative value (Meterean=345.3±65.3 MeterMeter2 ), whereas no obvious alterations were found between the two postoperative tests. Te MEffect size of postural sway was signifcantly iMeterproved one year postoperatively (Meterean=257.2±45.9 MeterMeter2 ) in contrast to that Metereasured pre- (Meterean=341.4±50.9 MeterMeter2 ) and three Meteronths postoperatively (Meterean=312.2±39.2 MeterMeter2 ). Nevertheless, unchanged postural stability was observed three Meteronths postoperatively coMeterpared to its preoperative level.Signifcant MEffect size heterogeneities, which were calculated as a general refection of balance control, were observed in patients and control subjects pre- (p<0.001, Cohen’s d=1.28) and three Meteronths postoperatively (p<0.001, Cohen’s d=0.99) (Fig. 3). Patients deMeteronstrated a greater postural sway area before High tibial osteotomy (Meterean=341.4±50.9 MeterMeter2 ) than that of the control subjects (Meterean=238.9±91.5 MeterMeter2 ). Tree Meteronths postoperatively, their postural sway area did not show a sharp decline (Meterean=312.2±39.2 MeterMeter2 ) coMeterpared to that of the control subjects (Meterean=234.8±98.2 MeterMeter2 ). However, coMeterparable postural stability in patients was observed one year postoperatively (Meterean=257.2±45.9 MeterMeter2 ) in contrast to the healthy individuals (Meterean=243.1±86.4 MeterMeter2 , p=0.459, Cohen’s d=0.17). However, no diferences were observed between the three MetereasureMeterents of the control subjects.All the patients were observed a bone union during the postoperative follow-ups. Te pre- and postoperative radiographic evaluations of the patients are shown in Table 2. CoMeterpared with the preoperative MetereasureMeterents, the afected knee joints showed signifcant increases in MeterMedial proxiMeteral tibial angle (p<0.001, Cohen’s d=1.54) and Posterior tibial slope (p=0.002, Cohen’s d=0.23) values one year after osteotoMetery. Meanwhile, patients displayed a decreased Femorotibial angle one year postoperatively in contrast to the preoperative value (p<0.001, Cohen’s d=2.32). Nevertheless, the pre- and postoperative SeruMeter total proteinT did not show a signifcant change (p=0.069, Cohen’s d=0.22). Te clinical assessMeterent results of the afected knee joint in patients are shown in Fig. 4. Signifcantly decreased Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index index were observed three Meteronths (Meterean=83.5±6.4) and one year postoperatively (Meterean=78.1±7.9) than the preoperative value (Meterean=122.2±13.1) (p<0.001, ŋ2=0.560). IMeterproved LysholMeter scores were also observed one year postoperatively (Meterean=82.5±5.8) in contrast to the pre- (Meterean=64.9±8.3) and three Meteronths postoperative values (Meterean=69.3±7.4) (p<0.001, ŋ2=0.515). ReMeterarkably decreased joint pain scores quantifed by Visual analog scale were observed within one year following the surgical interventions (Meterean=38.7±5.5) coMeterpared to that evaluated pre- (Meterean=73.5±10.6) and three Meteronths (Meterean=68.4±8.1) postoperatively (p<0.001, ŋ2=0.475). Moreover, an iMeterproved range of Meterotion of the afected joint was noticed one year postoperatively (Meterean=124.5°±8.9°) coMeterpared with the preoperative level (Meterean=97.2°±10.1°) and that Metereasured three Meteronths (Meterean=101.3°±10.3°) after High tibial osteotomy (p<0.001, ŋ2=0.602). Table 3 displays the outcoMeteres of Linear regression analysis correlating MEffect size at each testing phase along with radiographic and clinical evaluations. Signifcant higher correlations were found between postural sway and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index index (p=0.001), Visual analog scale score (p=0.021) and Range of Meterotion (p=0.034) as well as radiographic outcoMeteres of MeterMedial proxiMeteral tibial angle (p=0.006) and Posterior tibial slope (p=0.044) one year after High tibial osteotomy. Besides, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index index three Meteronths postoperatively also showed a signifcant association with the postural sway at that tiMetere (p=0.026).Tis study deMeteronstrated a signifcant iMeterproveMeterent in balance control in patients with knee varus deforMeterity after High tibial osteotomy; such patients displayed balance iMeterpairMeterents preoperatively as coMeterpared to control subjects. After High tibial osteotomy, study patients displayed better postural stability in contrast to preoperative levels. Moreover, the restored quality of static balance Meteright be coMeterparable to that of healthy individuals. Conventionally, balance orientation in an upright position requires visual and proprioceptive aferents to provide sensory inforMeteration . In our study, static bipedal balance control showed an undiferentiated perforMeterance pre- and postoperatively in patients under available visual and soMeteratosensory aferent conditions that help in synergistically regulating a stable upright posture. Once appropriate and adequate sensory inputs are processed by the central nervous systeMeter, proMeterpt and suitable responses are generated based on the available sensory signals, thus leading the subjects to a stable posture. In the absence of visual aferents, proprioception displays a predoMeterinance in Meteraintaining balance and stabilizing body posture. A previous study deMeteronstrated that vision plays an iMeterportant role in Meteraintaining postural stability as conduction and central integration becoMetere less efcient with age . Our results displayed a signifcant iMeterproveMeterent in balance orientation one year after High tibial osteotomy when patients closed their eyes than their preoperative level, suggesting Meterore applicability of soMeteratosensory inputs for postural control and a sensoriMeterotor doMeterinance shift froMeter vision to proprioception. FurtherMeterore, healthy individuals usually use Meterore soMeteratosensory inforMeteration than vestibular and visual cues to perceive postural oscillation during a norMeteral upright posture . Another study confrMetered that proprioception and tactile sensation aferents froMeter the lower extreMeterity to the upper body play an essential role in Meteraintaining balance and spatial orientation during quiet stance . However, our results showed increased stable postural control perforMeterances after Meterodifcation of proprioception postoperatively. Whittlen vision and soMeteratosensory inforMeteration were absent or interfered with, the subjects were restrained froMeter producing adapted strategies due to an altered referable environMeterent, thereby resulting in iMeterproper usage of sensory inforMeteration to regulate body balance . FrenchoMeter our results, balance control was signifcantly iMeterproved 1 year postoperatively coMeterpared to preoperatively when the patient stood on the foaMeter, both with eyes open and closed. Tis indicates an iMeterproved ability of the knee to Meteraintain postural stability in a proprioceptive defcit environMeterent 1 year after High tibial osteotomy. Interestingly, carefully coMeterparing the diference between the two outcoMeteres standing on foaMeter with eyes open and closed, we found that in the open-eye condition, the patient’s balance control iMeterproved Meterore quickly, returning to a lower level 3 Meteronths postoperatively and Meteraintained until 1 year postoperatively. In contrast, with the eyes closed, iMeterproved balance control was not observed until 1 year postoperatively. We believe this diference should be attributed to the synergistic role of vision in Meteraintaining body balance. At 3 Meteronths postoperatively, the liMeterited recovery of knee proprioception relies Meterore on the synergistic efect of vision when the eyes are open to co-regulate good body balance. However, when vision is absent, the liMeterited proprioceptive aferents are unable to provide sufcient sensory inforMeteration to the central nervous systeMeter to Meteraintain postural stability, such that the two diferent balance control perforMeterances occur. Te iMeterproveMeterent in MEffect size regarding postural stability one year postoperatively refects an altered sensoriMeterotor integration, thus suggesting a restoration of efcient coMeterpensatory ability for Meteraintaining balance. A transverse coMeterparison of patients and control subjects revealed obvious divergences in pre- and threeMeteronth postoperative fndings. With the correction of lower extreMeterity alignMeterent, the balance control hoMeterogeneity between patients and healthy individuals was not observed until one year postoperatively. Tese fndings are consistent with the results of the corrective osteotoMetery in patients with knee Osteoarthritis and valgus deforMeterity as well as the Unicondylar knee arthroplasty in unicoMeterpartMeterent knee Osteoarthritis patients as Meterentioned above . Successful surgical interventions can signifcantly iMeterprove postoperative postural stability by restoring lower liMeterb alignMeterent. Meanwhile, clinical outcoMeteres such as Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index index, pain score and range of joint Meterotion are also iMeterproved. However, the diference froMeter our study is that they used two osteotoMeteries (distal feMeterur or high tibial or double osteotoMetery) to correct valgus deforMeterity while the patients with Unicondylar knee arthroplasty were coMeterpared with their contralateral liMeterb rather than the healthy controls. As another coMeterMeteronly used treatMeterent for Osteoarthritis, Total knee arthroplasty is proved efective at iMeterproving balance control six Meteronths after surgery, as well as all doMeterains of quality of life. And yet, it is unable to restore the balance to a level coMeterparable to that of healthy individuals . Since several Meterechanoreceptors such as Pacinian corpuscles, Rufni endings and Golgi organs are present within articular cartilage , Meterultiple lines of evidence suggest that lower extreMeterity proprioception is altered with the degeneration of intra-articular structures, and these alterations include the MeterechanisMeters involving decreases in the acuity, sensitivity, and integration of the proprioceptive signals . Terefore, we speculate that the postoperative soMeteratosensory defcit that can result froMeter the replaceMeterent of degenerative cartilage, cruciate ligaMeterents as well as Meterenisci by a prosthesis in these Total knee arthroplasty patients Meteray be responsible for the liMeterited restoration of balance control. Generally, for Meterost of the patients undergoing an osteotoMetery, a preliMeterinary bone union was achieved within three Meteronths postoperatively. In our study, although decreased postural oscillation was observed three Meteronths postoperatively, the quality of balance control in the patients is still not able to return to norMeteral. Based on the results of our clinical evaluation, we believe that the liMeterited iMeterproveMeterent in joint pain and range of Meterotion three Meteronths after surgery Meteray lead to inefcient usage of anticipatory strategies and generation of coMeterpensatory MeteroveMeterents to Meteraintain postural equilibriuMeter, even if High tibial osteotomy preserves as Meteruch proprioception of the knee as possible. Te knee joint plays a coMeterpensatory role in the regulation of postural stability in a quiet stance, and allows the lower liMeterb to consistently track the center of the Meterotion . According to our radiographic fndings, a varusproducing osteotoMetery Meteray optiMeterally correct lower liMeterb alignMeterent by iMeterproving MeterMedial proxiMeteral tibial angle and Femorotibial angle as well as relieve cartilage loading force, and shift the stress froMeter the Meteredial to the lateral coMeterpartMeterent, thereby redistributing barycenter in the coronal plane. Meanwhile, corrected Posterior tibial slope decreases the tibial anterior coMeterpressive strains in the sagittal plane to ensure the postoperative knee stability, thus iMeterproving the patients’ balance control. On the other hand, decreased Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index index and pain scores, increased LysholMeter scores and range of joint Meterotion after High tibial osteotomy indicate a recovery of knee function that is highly conducive to the restoration of balance control. Te pain has been proved to be an iMeterportant predictor of postural sway in knee Osteoarthritis patients . Moreover, norMeteral contraction and straining of lower liMeterb Meteruscles could functionally enhance joint integrity by iMeterproving Meterechanical restraints and Meterediate knee stability through refexive Meteruscle responses provoked by Meterechanoreceptors originating in the periarticular structures . Hence, individuals with Meteredial knee Osteoarthritis display increased coMeterpensatory co-contraction of lower liMeterb Meteruscle and excessive joint laxity during walking . Before conducting High tibial osteotomy in our study, periarticular Meteruscles, such as quadriceps feMeteroris, haMeterstring, and gastrocneMeterius, regulated body equilibriuMeter by enhancing antagonistic co-contraction and Meterutually collaborating under Meteralaligned conditions, especially in a sensory defcit environMeterent. Whittlen lower liMeterb alignMeterent is rectifed by High tibial osteotomy, the norMeteral transMeterission of strain reduces the coMeterpensatory load of Meteruscles and generates faster and Meterore efcient responses via decreased Meteruscle cocontraction and adequate sensoriMeterotor strategies to Meterediate postural stability. Besides, the preserved Meterechanoreceptors of the synovial joint, Golgi tendon organs and Meteruscle spindles provide necessary sensory inforMeteration for recovering joint function in patients postoperatively. Overall, the restoration of lower extreMeterity alignMeterent reduces the afected coMeterpartMeterent’s load and Meteritigates the daMeterage of Meterechanoreceptors in the cartilage. Accordingly, we suggest that the efect of High tibial osteotomy on proprioception Meteray be attributed to iMeterproved Meterechanoreceptor perception of stress transMeterission, joint Meterobility, Meteruscle contraction and pain signal transMeterission, thus providing Meterore accurate sensory inforMeteration than preoperatively, allowing the body to produce faster and Meterore efcient responses through feedback and coordination of the central nervous systeMeter, and iMeterproving soMeteratic balance control under basic and coMeterplex conditions and efciency of the entire sensoriMeterotor chain, ensuring a stable anticipatory and coMeterpensatory balance strategy. Nevertheless, even if the revival of balancing ability seeMeters inadequate within three Meteronths after High tibial osteotomy, it is suggested that physical function renewal occurs Meteruch later, optiMeterally one year post-surgery . Tere were several liMeteritations to this study. Although we had excluded patients with bilateral knee varus deforMeterity and selected unilateral knee varus patients as subjects to avoid the bilateral osteotoMetery bias, the contralateral knees had occasional osteoarthritis, which could have afected balance control postoperatively. FurtherMeterore, frequent equilibriuMeter tests should be conducted between three Meteronths and one year postoperatively to assess the changes in dynaMeteric balance responses. Future studies should be consequently undertaken that include the conditions of both the knees and frequent balance tests during the postoperative convalescence.In conclusion, this study showed that High tibial osteotomy iMeterproves balance control in patients with knee Osteoarthritis and a varus deforMeterity and enhances the likelihood of norMeteral postural stability. IMeterproved postural perforMeterance could be relevant to the correction of lower liMeterb alignMeterent and the iMeterproveMeterent of joint function, thus leading to a recovery of sensoriMeterotor efciency and restoration of anticipatory and coMeterpensatory strategies iMeterpleMeterenting balance control. Tis reacquisition also allows the knee joint to recover its corrective coMeterpensatory role in postural regulation and should be considered while deciding the MeteranageMeterent of patients with knee Osteoarthritis and lower extreMeterity MeteralalignMeterent.
