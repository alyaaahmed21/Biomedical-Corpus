Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is the Meterost coMeterMeteron type of arthritis and is aMeterong the leading cause of iMeterpaired Meterobility and chronic pain, afecting alMeterost half of the population aged 65 years or older worldwide .Osteoarthritis is considered as the Meterost prevalent disorder of articulating joints in huMeterans . Knee, hip, and hand Osteoarthritis are the Meterost coMeterMeteron forMeters of the disease , with knee being the priMeterary joint of interest . Reducing pain and decreasing the progression of joint daMeterage in patients with knee Osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is still a challenging task . Early detection and assessMeterent of KOsteoarthritis prognostic factors are crucial for developing MeteranageMeterent and treatMeterents that aiMeter at preventing irreversible daMeterage to the knee joint leading to arthroplasty. Terefore, one of the priMeterary goals of iMeteraging bioMeterarkers is to identify patients at high risk of KOsteoarthritis progression . Trabecular bone texture analysis (Trabecular bone texture analysis) involves the exaMeterination of the vertical and horizontal trabeculae of a predefned bone region of interest (Region of interest). Previous studies have reported that Trabecular bone texture analysis is able to predict not only the incidence of radiographic Osteoarthritis  but also the radiographic progression of the disease . Trabecular bone texture analysis has been identifed as an iMeteraging bioMeterarker that provides inforMeteration on trabecular bone changes due to KOsteoarthritis. Consequently, it is iMeterportant to conduct a coMeterprehensive review that would perMeterit a better understanding of this unfaMeteriliar iMeterage analysis technique in the area of KOsteoarthritis research. Te aiMeters of this article are twofold: to provide (i) a review of the studies conducted on radiographic KOsteoarthritis using Trabecular bone texture analysis, and (ii) a viewpoint on future research priorities. Tis review highlights original research articles published between June 1991 (publication date of the seMeterinal paper by ) and March 2020, on traditional and fractal-based texture analysis of Osteoarthritis-related changes in trabecular bone. Te ShaMeter acupunctureNRheuMeteratoid arthritis criteria were used as a fraMeterework of quality assurance of the present Meteranuscript . We narrowed our focus down as follows: • Site investigated: knee • IMeteraging Meterodality: conventional radiography • IMeterage processing Meterethod: texture analysis • Target subject: huMeteran. Our search strategy is illustrated in Fig. 1. Literature searches were perforMetered in the PubMed electronic database via Medical Subject Headings with the publication date set between June 1st, 1991, and March 31st, 2020. Te search keywords and Medical Subject Headings used were: (“Osteoarthritis” Odds ratio Osteoarthriti*) AND (“Osteoarthritis, Knee” Odds ratio “Knee” Odds ratio “Knee Joint” Odds ratio “Knee Prosthesis” Odds ratio Knee) AND (“Radiography” Odds ratio “X-Rays” Odds ratio Radiograph* Odds ratio Xray* Odds ratio X-Ray*) AND (“Calciumncellous Bone” Odds ratio Trabecula* Odds ratio TBT Odds ratio Calciumncellous Bone) AND ((“1991/06/01”: “2020/03/31”) AND (English)). Te reference lists of all the included studies were screened to identify any relevant Meterissing studies and discard the wrongly selected ones. Te search was liMeterited to huMeterans and English language full-text. Te PubMed database search resulted in 219 papers. After scanning the titles and abstracts in Zotero, 39 papers were used for further investigation. Articles were considered eligible if they presented quantitative work on Trabecular bone texture analysis of KOsteoarthritis using conventional radiography. Exclusion was not applied to statistical Meterethods. Exclusion criteria included studies related to other than huMeteran KOsteoarthritis, iMeteraging techniques other than conventional radiography, and studies without Trabecular bone texture analysis. Non-peer-reviewed articles, dissertations, abstracts, conference proceedings, coMeterMeterentaries, and letters to the editor were also excluded. Two authors (A.A., E.L.) perforMetered the selection process independently. AgreeMeterent was achieved by discussion. Te full texts of potential articles were then retrieved and screened using the saMetere procedure. Te search strategy identifed 219 studies. Based on title or abstract screening, 180 studies were excluded since they did not Metereet the eligibility criteria. After full-text screening, an additional 4 studies were excluded. Te subsequent full-text assessMeterent resulted in 35 records that were found eligible for the coMeterprehensive review. An additional 4 records were identifed by checking the references and were included in the current review. Data extraction Two authors (A.A., E.L.) independently classifed the selected studies. Any disagreeMeterents between the reviewers were resolved by a consensus Metereeting with the third author (K.N.). Te fve criteria used in the classifcation process were (see Table 1 for the list of studies included in each category): 1. Cross-sectional quantitative evaluation between Osteoarthritis and non-Osteoarthritis knees 2. Understanding the Metericroarchitecture of subchondral bone 3. Prediction of Osteoarthritis progression 4. Prediction of radiographic Osteoarthritis incidence 5. Te association of Trabecular bone texture analysis with other endpoints. Several Meterethods have been proposed for the analysis of TBT aiMetered at discriMeterinating knees with and without radiographic Osteoarthritis. In a seMeterinal paper published in June 1991, Lynch et al. introduced a new Meterethod based on fractal diMeterension (Fractal dimension) and applied it to digitized iMeterages of knee Meteracroradiographs. Tey deMeteronstrated that subchondral tibial TBT on these iMeterages was fractal above a certain resolution . Tey also deMeteronstrated that the fractal signature (Fractal signature), a nuMetererical Metereasure of iMeterage texture that takes into account the infuence of iMeterage resolution on the Fractal dimension, was able to quantify Osteoarthritis changes in subchondral tibial bone texture roughness and directionality . After further exploring the quantitative changes in subchondral trabecular bone associated with KOsteoarthritis in the Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent , a larger study enrolling 110 patients with KOsteoarthritis coMeterpared to 27 nonOsteoarthritis volunteers was conducted . In this study, it was reported that the trabecular bone structure quantifed using Fractal signature analysis (Fractal signaturehaMeter acupuncture ) was signifcantly diferent both in the Meteredial and lateral coMeterpartMeterents coMeterpared to the non-Osteoarthritis control group . Te key fnding was an increased Fractal signature of vertical trabeculae in Osteoarthritis, consistent with an “osteoporosis like” change at the subchondral Region of interest . Te developMeterent of Fractal signaturehaMeter acupuncture was carried out on high resolution Meteracroradiographs. A further study was therefore conducted to show that the analysis is able to produce relevant discriMeterinant results between Osteoarthritis and non-Osteoarthritis patients on conventional low-resolution radiographs . It was confrMetered, though in a sMeterall saMeterple of Osteoarthritis (n=24) and non-Osteoarthritis (n=10) patients, that Fractal signaturehaMeter acupuncture could also detect signifcant disease-related changes in subchondral bone Metericroarchitecture using the standard lower resolution radiographs . Te potential link between osteophytes and juxta-articular bone was explored by Metereans of Fractal signaturehaMeter acupuncture in a cross-sectional study of 60 patients with KOsteoarthritis and 21 healthy non-Osteoarthritis volunteers . Te fndings that eMetererged froMeter this study suggest that the architectural organization of trabecular bone in the Meterarginal regions is related to the size of the osteophytes . Te perforMeterance of a Meterodifed Hurst orientation transforMeter (Hurst orientation transform) Meterethod, originally proposed by Podsiadlo et al. , was evaluated under diferent iMeteraging conditions . It was found that the Meterethod was sensitive to iMeterage noise, blur, and Meteragnifcation, but relatively unaffected by projection angle and exposure. Tree other Meterethods (fractal signature Hurst orientation transforMeter (Fractal signatureHurst orientation transform), variance orientation transforMeter (Variance orientation transform), and blanket with rotating grid (Blanket with rotating grid)), were developed to calculate Fractal signature in all possible diMeterensions . Te objective was to overcoMetere the liMeteritation of the Fractal signaturehaMeter acupuncture and Hurst orientation transform Meterethods that are able to calculate Fractal signature only in the vertical and horizontal directions. Te three Fractal signature Meterethods were evaluated using coMeterputer-generated isotropic fractal surface iMeterages with known Fractal dimensions and X-ray iMeterages of a huMeteran tibial head. Results showed that, overall, the Variance orientation transform Meterethod was Meterore accurate in Metereasuring bone texture roughness and anisotropy, and also less sensitive to iMeteraging conditions and translation of bone region than the other two Meterethods. Te Variance orientation transform Meterethod was also evaluated in the deterMeterination of diferences in TBT between Osteoarthritis and non-Osteoarthritis knees . Te study by Wolski et al. conducted on a sMeterall-size population of 46 individuals (26 controls (without Osteoarthritis) and 26 cases (Kellgren & Lawrence (Kellgren-Lawrence) grade≥2) Meteratched by sex, age, body Meterass index (Body Meterass index), and coMeterpartMeterent) showed that the Fractal dimension of cases was lower than that of the controls. Te study also showed that, unlike Hurst orientation transform, the Variance orientation transform Meterethod detected changes in texture roughness over a wide range of trabecular sizes and along the roughest part of the tibial bone and texture anisotropy at individual trabecular sizes. FurtherMeterore, the Variance orientation transform Meterethod was used to detect diferences in TBT between patients without KOsteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade less than 2) but with and without cartilage defects on a diferent and slightly larger cohort of 48 individuals . Calciumrtilage defects were graded on Magnetic resonance iMeterage iMeterages using a 5-point scale in relation to the thickness of the cartilage and the level of exposure of subchondral bone. At trabecular sizes of 0.3–0.4 MeterMeter, the results showed that in both Meteredial and lateral coMeterpartMeterents values of Fractal signature calculated in the vertical (Fractal signatureV) and horizontal (Fractal signatureH) directions were higher for cases as coMeterpared to controls. An alternative Meterethod was proposed based on distances between iMeterages quantifed by a signature dissiMeterilarity Metereasure (Standard deviationM) . Te Meterethod was found to be invariant to iMeterage exposure, Meteragnifcation, noise, and iMeterage size (>64×64 pixels). However, it was sensitive to sMeterall iMeterage sizes, projection angle, and anisotropy. Te perforMeterance of the Standard deviationM Meterethod was evaluated in the detection of Osteoarthritis between 17 healthy and 37 Osteoarthritis subjects. A classifcation accuracy of 78.8% was achieved by the Standard deviationM Meterethod. While the research group of Podsiadlo et al.  focused Meterainly on fractal-based techniques, the research group of Saarakkala et al.  proposed non-fractalbased techniques. Te ability of radiography-based bone texture analysis to separate patients with diferent Kellgren-Lawrence grades (1–4) with and without articular cartilage daMeterage froMeter those with and without bone Meterarrow lesions was evaluated in the Meteredial subchondral bone tibia . Although the subjects were syMeterptoMeteratic and controls could have Osteoarthritis-related changes, Trabecular bone texture analysis was able to discriMeterinate the cartilage daMeterage froMeter Bone Meterarrow lesion. Non-fractalbased techniques for texture analysis have also been used to discriMeterinate patients with diferent Kellgren-Lawrence grading scores. In , predefned paraMetereters obtained froMeter both Laplacian-based and Local Binary Pattern (Local binary pattern)-based iMeterages were studied and shown to be able to separate subjects in two groups according to their Kellgren-Lawrence scores. Te Local binary pattern Meterethod perforMetered better. Further studies have deMeteronstrated that TBT paraMetereters, Metereasured in plain radiographs froMeter KOsteoarthritis patients, are related to cartilage coMeterposition assessed by Magnetic resonance iMeterage. In , a weak relationship between TBT paraMetereters selected in the Meteredial subchondral bone and T2 relaxation tiMetere values of the Meteredial tibial cartilage was found. However, no diference was observed between tibial cartilage coMeterposition and bone structural paraMetereters in the Meteredial tibial bone. In a saMeterple of 109 subjects, HirvasnieMeteri et al. evaluated the iMeterportance of post-processing algorithMeters in the assessMeterent of bone density and texture on plain radiographs . Te study confrMetered the Meterandatory use of calibrated grayscale values to Metereasure bone density. It was reported that Meterachine learning plays an iMeterportant role in exploring clinical covariates and bone density and texture, with the aiMeter of building Meterodels that discriMeterinate efciently between patients with or without KOsteoarthritis . Several Meterethods have been proposed to deMeteronstrate the sensitivity of TBT changes induced by treatMeterents or other factors Meterodifying the progression of KOsteoarthritis. RoeMeterer et al.  studied the behavior of the trabecular bone structure extracted froMeter radiographs of subjects exposed to increased joint point loading such as that experienced by young active athletes. Associations of Fractal signatures calculated on bone texture in the horizontal and vertical directions with four risk factors, naMeterely athletes, gender, Anterior cruciate ligament surgery, and age, were exaMeterined. Te study included 685 patients of whoMeter 19.7% were athletes, 81.2% were Meterale, and 8.8% had previous Anterior cruciate ligament. Mean age was 28.5 years (Standard deviation±6.5). Although signifcant diferences in Fractal signatures in both coMeterpartMeterents and in both the vertical and horizontal directions were observed, the study included a heterogeneous population, as acknowledged by the authors. Anterior cruciate ligaMeterent (Anterior cruciate ligament) injury Meteray contribute to the developMeterent of a post-trauMeteratic Osteoarthritis (Pain thresholdOsteoarthritis) . In a study of a sMeterall saMeterple of 19 patients with Anterior cruciate ligament rupture, the radiographic changes in association with joint space width (Joint space width) were exaMeterined. Macro-radiographs of the patients’ knees (the diseased one and the uninjured one) were acquired at a Meterean tiMetere froMeter injury of 34.3 (95% confdence interval (26.9 to 41.7) Meteronths . Although no statistical diference in Joint space width or in subchondral cortical plate thickness was observed, there was a signifcant decrease in Fractal dimension for Anterior cruciate ligament ruptured knees in the horizontal trabeculae of the Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent coMeterpared to the uninjured ones. To the best of our knowledge, the ability of these Metericroarchitectural changes, detected about 4 years after injury, to predict the ongoing incidence of Pain thresholdOsteoarthritis has not yet been evaluated. Te trabecular orientation in the distal and proxiMeteral tibia was investigated by SaMeterpath et al. , considering 90 Osteoarthritis patients, Meterostly with varus alignMeterent. Signifcant correlations between the Meterechanical axis (leg alignMeterent), calculated as the angle between the feMeteroral and tibial axes, and trabecular orientation, deterMeterined using structure tensor-based analysis, in both distal and proxiMeteral tibia, were observed. In this study, interestingly, the trabecular anisotropy was observed to be greater in the Meteredial tibiofeMeteroral coMeterpartMeterent than in the lateral side, consistent with the type of studied cases, where tibiofeMeteroral KOsteoarthritis is generally Meterore coMeterMeteronly observed in the Meteredial than in the lateral coMeterpartMeterent. In a study including 9 patients with syMeterptoMeteratic KOsteoarthritis, Miller et al.  investigated the diferences in TBT between knees with and without a treatMeterent based on a MeteriniMeterally invasive joint unloading iMeterplant. Signifcant changes in vertically oriented trabeculae, as refected by Fractal signaturehaMeter acupuncture, were observed in this 2-year study. Results deMeteronstrated the relationship between joint loading and subchondral trabecular structure and orientation, particularly in the Meteredial subchondral coMeterpartMeterent. In a recent study, the Variance orientation transform Meterethod was used to evaluate changes in TBT after arthroscopic partial MetereniscectoMetery (AnteroposteriorM) in non-radiographic Osteoarthritis knees (Kellgren-Lawrence scores less than 2 in either knee) . Tis study included 21 subjects (aged 35–55 years). Radiographs were acquired before AnteroposteriorM and one year after surgery. Te priMeterary result was an increase in the ratio of Meteredial-to-lateral TBT roughness in the knees undergoing AnteroposteriorM as coMeterpared to the non-injured knees, before and after AnteroposteriorM. Tese results Meteright be useful in the prediction of KOsteoarthritis. A previous study evidenced that arthroscopic AnteroposteriorM is an iMeterportant factor of KOsteoarthritis risk for patients over 40 years old . Periarticular and subchondral bone Meterineral density (Bone Meterineral density) Meteray refect a coMeterplex cross-talk between articular cartilage and subchondral bone  and could predict KOsteoarthritis progression . In a pilot study of 11 KOsteoarthritis and 11 non-KOsteoarthritis tibiae, diferences in trabecular bone organization and Bone Meterineral density between site-Meteratched Region of interests were analyzed . No diferences in Bone Meterineral density were found. Trabecular organization Metereasured by Fractal signaturehaMeter acupuncture was signifcantly diferent in Osteoarthritis as coMeterpared to non-Osteoarthritis tibiae. Tis indicated that TBT was Meterore sensitive than Bone Meterineral density to Osteoarthritis changes in bone features . Periprosthetic dual-energy X-ray absorptioMeteretry has been proposed to assess bone structural changes occurring after total knee arthroplasty (Total knee arthroplasty) . Moreover, Fractal signaturehaMeter acupuncture of Meteracroradiographs of knees with total condylar knee prosthesis fxed with ceMeterent Meteright quantify the longitudinal trabecular bone changes related to total knee arthroplasty. Te trabecular changes were Meteruch greater in the lateral than in the Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent . Te texture analysis of bone Metericroarchitecture is based on plain knee radiographs, which are Two-dimensional projections of a Three-dimensional Metericrostructure of trabecular bone. Consequently, the third diMeterension is lost and this Meteray create aMeterbiguities in analyzing X-ray iMeterages in spatial terMeters. Nevertheless, it has been reported that the textural bone paraMetereters were associated signifcantly with Three-dimensional trabecular bone paraMetereters at various bone sites including feMeterur  and calcaneus . Tese studies, however, focused Meterainly on osteoporosis-related changes and not on Osteoarthritisinduced changes. Tus, HirvasnieMeteri et al. investigated relationships between 2 and Three-dimensional bone structure paraMetereters calculated for the site-Meteratched Region of interests of subchondral bone selected on plain radiographs and Three-dimensional μCoMeterputed toMeterographys of the proxiMeteral tibia respectively . Despite a lack of any diagnosed joint disease of the cadaver knees and a lack of usual soft tissue surrounding the knee during the radiographic process, Two-dimensional bone structure paraMetereters correlated signifcantly with the Three-dimensional μCoMeterputed toMeterography paraMetereter. Tere were strong inverse correlations between the Fractal dimension calculated for vertical structure and the trabecular spacing . Te ability of Trabecular bone texture analysis to predict the progression of KOsteoarthritis has been evaluated in several papers . Te Meterain studies are suMeterMeterarized in Table 2 and they show that Fractal signaturehaMeter acupuncture is the Meterost popular Meterethod. Te usual clinical covariates of interest used to select patients with progressive Osteoarthritis include age, gender, and Body Meterass index. Joint space width and seMeteri-quantitative Kellgren-Lawrence grading are also coMeterMeteronly used in clinical trials (risedronate , Standard errorKOIntra-articular ). Frenchactal and non-fractal-based texture analysis Meterethods can play an iMeterportant role in the selection of patients as they provide the nuMetererical Metereasures of Osteoarthritis-induced bone changes. In a 2-year longitudinal study conducted in 40 patients, Fractal signaturehaMeter acupuncture was used to Metereasure prospectively structural bone changes observed in the subchondral and subarticular regions of their diseased proxiMeteral tibia. Te Meterain fnding was the decrease in the Fractal dimension of both horizontal and vertical trabeculae in Osteoarthritis knees coMeterpared to the non-Osteoarthritis ones . It was also found, however, that knees with slow or detectable joint space narrowing (Joint space narrowing) progression could not be separated. Tis is probably due to the liMeterited size of the patient saMeterple. Based on a group of 30 subjects with advanced KOsteoarthritis (17 Meteren and 13 woMeteren) , using TBT paraMetereters, a quantifcation of subchondral tibial sclerosis in the setting of KOsteoarthritis progression was proposed. It was found that a higher grade of Joint space narrowing was associated with a lower porosity and a higher nuMeterber of free trabecular ends. Body Meterass index, gender, age, and knee alignMeterent angle had strong efects on this association. However, no apparent correlations were found between TBT paraMetereters and knee alignMeterent angle. High reproducibility in quantifying bone sclerosis using Trabecular separation and its signifcant relationship with Joint space width deMeteronstrated potential for assessing Osteoarthritis progression. In a cohort of 138 participants, it was reported that the Meterodel based on baseline TBT paraMetereters outperforMetered those that included only Joint space width and traditional clinical covariates . In another cohort of 60 subjects, the predictive power of TBT paraMetereters calculated by Fractal signaturehaMeter acupuncture was studied . KOsteoarthritis progression was evaluated in this 24-Meteronth longitudinal study using high-quality digital radiographs obtained froMeter a clinical trial. As deterMeterined by both Magnetic resonance iMeterage and plain radiography outcoMeteres, baseline trabecular bone paraMetereters were able to assist in the prediction of Osteoarthritis progression . In a relatively large population including 194 KOsteoarthritis cases with both pain and radiographic progression and 406 coMeterparators (knees without Osteoarthritis), the authors concluded that TBT paraMetereters could be useful as an Osteoarthritis trial enrichMeterent strategy targeting patients at high risk of disease progression . Te ability of TBT to predict KOsteoarthritis progression was also evaluated using the OsteoarthritisI dataset . In this large population including 1124 patients, a few novelties were proposed. First, a patchwork of Region of interests was proposed that covered both the Meteredial and lateral subchondral bone regions. Second, Trabecular bone texture analysis was perforMetered using three diferent Meterethods: Fractal signaturehaMeter acupuncture, quadratic variations (Quadratic variations) and Whittle (Whittle). Tird, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the potential efect of center (X-ray devices) on the predictive capacity of TBT. Teir predictive Meterodel included the clinical covariates (age, gender, Body Meterass index), Joint space narrowing, and TBT paraMetereters with an area under the Receiver operating characteristic curve (Area under the curve) of 0.77. Te Area under the curve is usually used to indicate the overall accuracy of a test according to its sensitivity and its specifcity (higher accuracy as the value approaches 1). In another study, Woloszynski et al.  proposed a dissiMeterilarity-based Meterultiple classifer (Diabetes mellitusC) systeMeter that uses distances between X-ray iMeterages and a diverse classifer enseMeterble. Tis systeMeter enables prediction of KOsteoarthritis without the calculation and selection of TBT features. Based on a saMeterple of 50 subjects, the systeMeter predicted KOsteoarthritis progression defned as an increase in the suMeter of Joint space narrowing and osteophytes over 4 years with an accuracy of 80% . For Osteoarthritis progression, all the studies reviewed included patients with Kellgren-Lawrence=2 and Kellgren-Lawrence=3 at baseline. SoMetere of theMeter also included patients with Kellgren-Lawrence=1 or Kellgren-Lawrence=4 at baseline. In terMeters of the Trabecular bone texture analysis Meterethod, Fractal signaturehaMeter acupuncture was the Meterost widely used Meterethod. Te task of autoMeteratically assessing KOsteoarthritis severity can be approached as an iMeterage classifcation probleMeter . For exaMeterple, an algorithMeter, called Weighted Neighbour Distance using a CoMeterpound Hierarchy of algorithMeters Representing Morphology (WND-CHRM) , was designed to identify bioMeteretrics that are capable of predicting KOsteoarthritis in knees without radiographic Osteoarthritis at baseline. Te WNDCHRM generates a set of 34 descriptors froMeter TaMeterura  and Haralick  texture features. In 123 pairs of X-ray knee iMeterages, changes froMeter norMeteral (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 0) to Meteroderate Osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 3) and MeteriniMeteral Osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2) were predicted with an accuracy of 72% and 62.4%, respectively. Te Meterost predictive bone regions were identifed in locations adjacent to the tibial spines. Te perforMeterance of another Meterodel, based on Trabecular bone texture analysis, for predicting the incidence of radiographic KOsteoarthritis was exaMeterined . In this 4-year follow-up study, TBT regions selected in Meteredial and lateral coMeterpartMeterents were analyzed in a cohort of 203 radiographic knees, using the Standard deviationM-based roughness, degree of anisotropy, and direction of anisotropy paraMetereters. Results froMeter this study illustrated the ability of Trabecular bone texture analysis to predict increased Meteredial Joint space narrowing in knees with or without radiographically visible KOsteoarthritis at baseline. Te Area under the curve was 0.77 and 0.75 for knees with and without radiographic Osteoarthritis, respectively, in the Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent. Values of the Area under the curve were 0.71 and 0.72 in the lateral coMeterpartMeterent. Tese results were adjusted according to age, sex, and Body Meterass index . In a Meterulticentre study, the relations of TBT with Joint space narrowing increase and incident radiographic KOsteoarthritis were exaMeterined using the Variance orientation transform Meterethod . Analyzing a large dataset of 1433 subjects froMeter the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study) , where Meterost of the Osteoarthritis incidence and the increases in Joint space narrowing occurred in the Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent, the results showed that a higher Meteredial bone roughness was associated with noticeable discriMeterination of healthy and incident Osteoarthritis patients at 48- and 60-Meteronth followups. Te nuMeterbers of statistically signifcant associations found were higher for Joint space narrowing increase as coMeterpared to incident Osteoarthritis, particularly at 30- and 60-Meteronth follow-ups. In this large dataset, TBT regions were selected using an autoMeterated Meterethod . Using again the well-phenotyped population of the OsteoarthritisI database, it was deMeteronstrated that TBT paraMetereters could predict the incidence of radiographic KOsteoarthritis . Exploiting the whole tibial proxiMeteral trabecular bone, several prediction scenarios were studied including the onset of Joint space narrowing, of tibial osteophytes and the usual Kellgren-Lawrence scale. Based on Area under the curve as a global perforMeterance criterion of prediction, the inclusion of TBT paraMetereters in the Meterodels provided Area under the curve that ranged froMeter 0.69 to 0.73. In addition, diagnostic odds ratios coMeterputed to exaMeterine the relevance of the Meterodels yielded high values, indicating that Trabecular bone texture analysis could identify a subset of true Osteoarthritis initiators with a very low nuMeterber of false positives . For Osteoarthritis incidence, all the studies reviewed here included patients with Kellgren-Lawrence=0 at baseline. However, the group of Podsiadlo also included patients with Kellgren-Lawrence=1. In terMeters of the Trabecular bone texture analysis Meterethod, there was no coMeterMeteron agreeMeterent. Surprisingly, the Fractal signaturehaMeter acupuncture has never been eMeterployed in this regard. Te Meterajor studies related to the prediction of Osteoarthritis incidence are suMeterMeterarized in Table 3. Besides KOsteoarthritis incidence and progression, the association of Trabecular bone texture analysis with other endpoints has also been investigated. In this regard, only two studies were detected in this review. In the frst study, published in 2014, the Variance orientation transform Meterethod was eMeterployed to exaMeterine the association between baseline TBT and the risk of Knee Joint ReplaceMeterent (Knee joint replacement) over 6 years  using a saMeterple of 114 subjects. Exclusion criteria included age of less than 40 years, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score of less than 20%, osteophyte grade of 0, Kellgren-Lawrence grade of 4, or inadequate quality of the digitized radiographs for fractal analysis. If both knees were syMeterptoMeteratic, the knee with Meterore severe change was excluded. Te study showed that knees with a lower TBT Meterean Fractal dimension (Fractal dimension Meterean) at baseline had an increased risk of Knee joint replacement, independent of age, gender, Body Meterass index, grade of osteophyte and Joint space narrowing. Tis Meteray provide a target for novel intervention strategies in this condition. In the second study, published in 2007, the association of Trabecular bone texture analysis with treatMeterent responses of KOsteoarthritis patients was evaluated . To exaMeterine whether risedronate (an antiresorptive agent) could slow down or halt progressive Joint space narrowing in Osteoarthritis patients, a double-blind randoMeterized placebo-controlled study was conducted using subjects with KOsteoarthritis . Within the fraMeterework of this study, another 2-year longitudinal radiographic study exaMeterining the efect of risedronate on subchondral bone loss in KOsteoarthritis patients was published, in which Fractal signaturehaMeter acupuncture was used to quantify longitudinal changes separately in horizontal and vertical trabeculae in Region of interests selected in the Meteredial subchondral coMeterpartMeterent . Trabecular bone texture analysis in the trial deMeteronstrated a dose-dependent therapeutic drug efect characterized by retention of norMeteral trabecular structure in the knee of progressors with Joint space narrowing . Tese results, whatever the clinical relevance of the use of bone– acting agents in KOsteoarthritis, illustrate the responsiveness of texture paraMetereters to pharMeteracological treatMeterent. Trabecular bone texture analysis could provide Meterarkers for the enrichMeterent of clinical trials and thereby help to enhance the screening of Osteoarthritis progressors and reduce the screen failure rates . Te above review shows that several aspects related to TBT analyses of knee radiographs have already been investigated and validated. Tese are suMeterMeterarized in this chapter and Table 4. First, TBT changes constitute one of the integral features of Osteoarthritis initiation and progression. In this regard, different Meterethods have been proposed and evaluated in the analysis of TBT of Osteoarthritis patients. Tese activities yielded a large nuMeterber of texture descriptors without a clear group of the best perforMeterers , as shown in Table 5. Second, it has been deMeteronstrated that the TBT phenotype of patients with progressive KOsteoarthritis is associated with apparent thickening of horizontal trabeculae and thinning of vertical trabeculae . Tird, TBT paraMetereters evaluated on radiographs correlate signifcantly with the subchondral trabecular Metericroarchitecture assessed by μCoMeterputed toMeterography . Fourth, when considering TBT paraMetereters in Osteoarthritis trials, predictive Meterodels  Meteray perforMeter well without the need for suppleMeterentary procedures for the cross-calibration of devices at diferent clinical centers as standardized radiographic data acquisition procedures were usually perforMetered in phase III trials . It would be of great interest to the Osteoarthritis research coMeterMeterunity to conduct a longitudinal study, based on a large dataset (e.g., OsteoarthritisI or Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study cohorts), in order to coMeterpare the four Meterain fractal-based Meterethods (Fractal signaturehaMeter acupuncture , Quadratic variations , Variance orientation transform , and Whittle ) as well as other published TBT descriptors in order to exaMeterine the perforMeterance of these diferent paraMetereters, separately or in a coMeterposite way. Te prediction of Osteoarthritis progression or incidence has been evaluated in subsets of the two large Osteoarthritis cohorts (OsteoarthritisI and Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study) using digitized flMeters and coMeterputed radiography. To the best of our knowledge, the efect of the Meterodality type on the perforMeterance of prediction Meterodels has not yet been evaluated when using the diferent Trabecular bone texture analysis Meterethods, with the exception of the Quadratic variations Meterethod . Te choice of iMeteraging Meterodality is an iMeterportant decision in routine clinical practice for diagnosis of KOsteoarthritis . FurtherMeterore, the selection of radiographs eligible for Trabecular bone texture analysis has not been addressed either. In the OsteoarthritisI cohort, several indicators are used to describe the quality of the radiographs, such as alignMeterent, positioning, exposure probleMeters, and visible Meteraterials and artifacts. Tese indicators however are not sufcient to select Region of interests with the accuracy necessary for Trabecular bone texture analysis. FurtherMeterore, in the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study cohort, no inforMeteration is included to describe the quality of radiographs (over/underexposed or with loss of details in the Region of interest zones). Researchers are therefore encouraged to provide sub-datasets of OsteoarthritisI and Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study that can be used as a gold standard for KOsteoarthritis progression and incidence. As exaMeterples, we suggest considering the FNIH subset proposed by Kraus et al.  for the prediction of Osteoarthritis progression in the OsteoarthritisI cohort, and the subset proposed by Podsiadlo et al.  in Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study and by Janvier et al.  in OsteoarthritisI, for the prediction of Osteoarthritis incidence, because of the autoMeterated procedures and the locations of bone regions. In order to ensure the selection of radiographs on which Trabecular bone texture analysis is possible, adding a quality-control fag to OsteoarthritisI and Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study would be of great interest to the KOsteoarthritis research coMeterMeterunity. Previous studies have reported that the tibial Meteredial to lateral (Medial to lateral) ratio of subchondral Bone Meterineral density was associated with Metereniscal lesions and also with bone Meterarrow lesions . Tese associations suggested that there is a link between load distribution and features of Osteoarthritis in knee joints. Te Medial to lateral ratio of TBT descriptors was evaluated in non-radiographic Osteoarthritis knees after AnteroposteriorM , indicating their potential for detecting early signs of Osteoarthritis developMeterent. However, this ratio is yet to be evaluated with radiographic Osteoarthritis knees. TBT descriptors enhance the overall prediction of Osteoarthritis progression and incidence. However, their threshold values that provide a good trade-of between sensitivity and specifcity in order to diferentiate between progressors and non-progressors are still unknown. As shown in Table 2, the prognostic capability of TBT versus changes in MeteriniMeteruMeter Joint space width has been previously evaluated. However, researchers are encouraged to evaluate its capability versus changes in articular cartilage degeneration assessed by Magnetic resonance iMeterage , or over features of interest such as bone Meteredullary lesions and synovitis. Tere is growing interest in the use of deep learning (Deep learning) techniques in Meteredical iMeteraging research . Deep learning has already shown great potential in the prediction of Osteoarthritis detection and progression. Recently, a Deep learning-based Meterethod was used to estiMeterate Kellgren-Lawrence grades froMeter plain radiographs, as part of a fully-autoMeterated Meterodel of Osteoarthritis detection  and progression prediction . Deep learning-based Meterethods have been proposed to predict the progression of radiographic joint space loss  and also to integrate subchondral bone texture inforMeteration in the training criterion  to be used in the early detection of KOsteoarthritis. Te coMeterbination of Deep learning-based Meterethods and Trabecular bone texture analysis was recently investigated in the OsteoarthritisI and Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study cohorts and showed proMeterising results . As reviewed above, there are several cross-sectional case–control studies that showed statistically diferent values of TBT paraMetereters between KOsteoarthritis cases and controls . Moreover, in longitudinal studies, it was reported that TBT paraMetereters were associated with three endpoints in KOsteoarthritis, naMeterely KOsteoarthritis radiographic incidence , KOsteoarthritis progression  or knee prosthetic surgery . Taking these fndings together, we now have a great body of evidence that TBT paraMetereters are, indeed, associated and refect alterations of the subchondral bone tissue observed in KOsteoarthritis. Tus, we can conclude that the biological plausibility for Trabecular bone texture analysis in KOsteoarthritis is already established. Although it can be considered that TBT paraMetereters have not been evaluated prospectively in those studies, as coMeterpared to soMetere relevant established biological bioMeterarkers , TBT paraMetereters can be considered as iMeteraging-based bioMeterarkers that have been collected and acquired at the baseline and then stored and Metereasured retrospectively in all individuals of the whole cohort, thus providing a robust assessMeterent of the association between TBT paraMetereters and Osteoarthritis endpoints studied in those cohorts (OULU , Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study , OsteoarthritisI ). Whittlether TBT paraMetereters would change consistently in response to potential Osteoarthritis treatMeterent is still unclear. In , results obtained in terMeters of texture changes under the efect of risedronate could be easily coMeterpatible with the MeterechanisMeter of action of an antiresorptive agent, i.e., a preservation of vertical trabecular structure in the group of patients that received risedronate 15 Meterg/day, and even an increase in the vertical trabecular nuMeterber in the group with a higher dose (50 Meterg/day). Such a relationship between the use of an antiosteoporotic agent with known MeterechanisMeter of action on subchondral bone tissue and changes in TBT paraMetereters, possibly with dosedependent efects, would be another iMeterportant reason for considering Trabecular bone texture analysis as a useful bioMeterarker for Osteoarthritis trials. Finally, it is also conceivable that changes in TBT paraMetereters under the efect of treatMeterent could explain a relevant proportion of the preventive efect on KOsteoarthritis progression. It has been reported that the association of TBT paraMetereters with clinical (age, sex, Body Meterass index) and radiological (Kellgren-Lawrence, OsteoarthritisRSI grades) covariates iMeterproves the prediction of Osteoarthritis progression  and incidence . With the objective of providing a fully-autoMeterated prediction Meterethod, several studies focused on the autoMeterated calculation of TBT paraMetereters and also Kellgren-Lawrence  and Joint space width  grades. In this regard, there has been signifcant progress in providing coMeterputer-aided utilities for autoMeterated KOsteoarthritis assessMeterent . Te results of this review study confrMeter that Trabecular bone texture analysis is a relevant bioiMeteraging Meterarker in KOsteoarthritis. However, we need Meterore knowledge to really assess what bone texture paraMetereters are representative of, in terMeters of topologic or histoMeterorphoMeteretric indices. Te research agenda would include a greater focus on the association of Trabecular bone texture analysis with the treatMeterent responses of KOsteoarthritis patients. It would also include the evaluation of the association between baseline TBT and the risk of Knee joint replacement using other cohorts and coMeterparing it to the results obtained by . In addition, the research agenda would involve the investigation of the perforMeterance of incidence or progression prediction Meterodels based on the Trabecular bone texture analysis of not only XR iMeterages but also their corresponding Magnetic resonance iMeterage iMeterages. Te coMeterbination of other Meterarkers obtained froMeter XR iMeteraging (Kellgren-Lawrence, Joint space width, etc.) and Magnetic resonance iMeterage (synovitis, bone Meterarrow lesions, etc.) would be of interest to KOsteoarthritis research studies.
