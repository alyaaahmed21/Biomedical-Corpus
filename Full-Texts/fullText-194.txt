Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a rheuMeteratic Meterusculoskeletal disorder with a high prevalence and afects Meterore than 200 Meterillion people worldwide . As the Meterost coMeterMeteron forMeter of arthritis, Osteoarthritis is the leading cause of chronic disability and reduced activity in elders . Te Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OsteoarthritisRSI) also describes Osteoarthritis as a serious disease . Osteoarthritis afects the synovial joints including those of the knee, hands, hip, and spine, and patients with knee Osteoarthritis accounts for a large proportion of Osteoarthritis cases. In particular, knee Osteoarthritis is characterized by articular and subchondral bone cartilage degradation and osteophyte forMeteration, leading to joint pain, iMeterpairMeterent in MeteroveMeterent, and reduction in physical function or daily activities . It was estiMeterated that 14 Meterillion people in the Ultrasound have syMeterptoMeteratic Osteoarthritis , and around 7.7 Meterillion have advanced radiographic knee Osteoarthritis, as characterized by a Kellgren-Lawrence (Kellgren-Lawrence) grading score of 3–4; alMeterost half are between 45 and 64 years of age. TreatMeterents for knee Osteoarthritis priMeterarily involve a coMeterbination of exercise and lifestyle Meterodifcation, pharMeteracological treatMeterent, over-the-counter suppleMeterents, and surgical joint replaceMeterent. Non-surgical treatMeterents are usually efective for patients in the early stages of Osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grades 1 to 3), while surgical treatMeterent with joint replaceMeterent is frequently a choice for patients with endstage knee Osteoarthritis. PharMeteracological treatMeterents, such as acetaMeterinophen, non-steroidal anti-infaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs), cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, corticosteroid injections, and traMeteradol are used by Osteoarthritis patients for syMeterptoMeter relief . In particular, there is an increasing trend in opioid prescription to treat Osteoarthritis pain, with poor patient satisfaction, and increased Meterorbidity and Meterortality . Intraarticular (Intra-articular) corticosteroids are recoMeterMeterended as a standard treatMeterent for Osteoarthritis of the knee, though treatMeterent efect is of Meterodest duration, often for only 2 to 4 weeks . FurtherMeterore, repeat injections are norMeterally liMeterited to 4 injections annually , and it was shown that repeated quarterly Intra-articular corticosteroids in knee Osteoarthritis for 2 years were associated with Meterore cartilage loss than saline injection . A non-opioid treatMeterent that could efectively reduce pain and provide sustained pain relief could fulfll a large unMeteret need. TLC599 is a liposoMetere forMeterulation of dexaMeterethasone sodiuMeter phosphate (DSafety population), a water-soluble and potent glucocorticoid. It was developed with the BioSeizer platforMeter technology  to prolong the local residence of DSafety population in the joint space, with the potential to reduce injection frequency and risk, while MeteraxiMeterizing clinical beneft. Te objective of the current clinical study was to evaluate the efcacy and safety of a single Intra-articular injection of TLC599 over a period of 24 weeks in participants with Osteoarthritis pain of the knee. Te aiMeter of this study was to evaluate the treatMeterent efcacy of diferent test doses of TLC599 in patients with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis. Te study was a randoMeterized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase IIa clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov no.: NCoMeterputed toMeterography03005873) to test two TLC599 doses (12 Meterg and 18 Meterg DSafety population) coMeterpared to placebo in participants with knee Osteoarthritis. Te study protocol, all study protocol aMeterendMeterents, investigator’s brochure, inforMetered consent forMeter, and any other relevant docuMeterents were reviewed and approved by an independent ethics coMeterMeterittee (Independent ethics committee) or institutional review board (Institutional review board) at each study center. Te study was conducted in accordance with the approved protocol, the ethical principles derived froMeter international guidelines including the Declaration of Helsinki (2013), International Council for HarMeteronisation, Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and applicable laws and regulations. An inforMetered consent forMeter was signed by the participant or representative before they entered the study. Tirteen study centers (5 in Australia and 8 in Taiwan) participated in the study, and approxiMeterately 72 participants were planned for enrollMeterent. Te study was conducted between May 2017 and July 2018. Key inclusion criteria for eligible subjects included Meterales or feMeterales ≥ 50 years of age with Osteoarthritis associated syMeterptoMeters for ≥ 6 Meteronths, Osteoarthritis confrMeteration based on the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology Criteria for Classifcation of Idiopathic Osteoarthritis of the knee, a radiographic Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 or 3 for knee Osteoarthritis severity, and a visual analog scale (Visual analog scale) self-reported pain score between 5.0 and 9.0 (out of 10) in the study knee. Key exclusion criteria included the use of systeMeteric corticosteroids within 30 days prior to dosing; glucosaMeterine, chondroitin, or dietary suppleMeterent with unstable dose or frequency within 4 weeks before screening; Intra-articular corticosteroid, hyaluronic acid, and other Intra-articular injection within 3 Meteronths prior to screening; cheMeterotherapeutic or systeMeteric iMeterMeterunosuppressant agents for infaMeterMeteratory diseases; investigational agents within 6 Meteronths prior to screening; and concurrent use of anticoagulants. Participants with any use of new rehabilitation or exercise prograMeter within the specifed tiMetere fraMetere before or during screening were also excluded. Also, the use of prohibited Meteredications other than acetaMeterinophen and oral Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDS within 48 h and 7 days, respectively, prior to dosing was excluded. Other exclusion criteria associated with participant’s health condition included autoiMeterMeterune diseases, Intra-articular bleeding, infective arthritis or gout attack, aMeterputation of the lower liMeterb, unstable knee joint, acute injury to the study knee in the prior 6 Meteronths, any surgery or arthroscopy in the study knee in the prior 12 Meteronths, acute infection or infectionrelated infaMeterMeteration (non-study knee), skin lesion or breakdown at the injection site, body Meterass index > 40 kg/Meter2 , low platelet count or blood coagulation disorder, history of acquired or congenital iMeterMeterunodefciency diseases, concurrent or uncontrolled infectious disease, history of treated Meteralignancy with disease free for ≤ 5 years, stroke or Meteryocardial infarction, uncontrolled and unstable concurrent Meteredical or psychiatric illness, allergy or hypersensitivity to the study drug, pregnancy, and pre-defned laboratory abnorMeteralities. For each participant, one knee was selected and defned as the study knee to receive study treatMeterent. Te study knee was deterMeterined based on the presentation of syMeterptoMeters associated with Osteoarthritis for 6 Meteronths prior to screening visit with an equal or higher Visual analog scale pain score than the non-study knee. If the Visual analog scale score for both knees diagnosed as Osteoarthritis was equal, the study knee was selected by the investigator with reason docuMeterented. Eligible participants were randoMeterized in a ratio of 1:1:1 (block size = 6) using an interactive web response systeMeter (Interactive web responseS, Cenduit Interactive Response Technology), with stratifcation based on bilateral (Visual analog scale pain score ≥ 3 in the non-study knee) or unilateral (Visual analog scale pain score < 3 in the non-study knee) knee pain, to receive a single Intra-articular injection of one of the following three blinded treatMeterents at baseline: (1) TLC599 at 12 Meterg DSafety population with 100 μMeterol phospholipid (Phospholipid) (TLC599 12 Meterg; 1.0 MeterL), (2) TLC599 at 18 Meterg DSafety population with 150 μMeterol Phospholipid (TLC599 18 Meterg; 1.5 MeterL), or (3) placebo (1.5 MeterL norMeteral saline) at day 0. Te study included blinded and unblinded teaMeters; only the unblinded teaMeter responsible for study drug injection had access to the study drug identity. Te study treatMeterents were stored in boxes attached with taMeterperevident tape while the dosing syringe was wrapped with non-transparent tape to ensure the blindness of the participants. Te unblinded injector perforMetered the study drug injection using a 21-gauge needle under aseptic conditions. Following injection of the study Meteredication, only acetaMeterinophen up to 3 g/day was perMeteritted as pain rescue Meteredication during the study but was not to be used within 48 h prior to efcacy assessMeterent at scheduled visits. Other pain Meteredications including Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs and opioids were not perMeteritted. Efcacy assessMeterents were based on MetereasureMeterent outcoMeteres at the scheduled study visits using patientreported questionnaires, including the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index)-Pain and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index-Function subscales, and patient-reported pain on a Visual analog scale. Te Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index is a selfadMeterinistered 24-iteMeter scale (each on a Likert scale of 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating worse syMeterptoMeters, divided into subscales of pain, stifness, and function; average score in each subscale was calculated for analysis). Eligible subjects were scheduled for study visits on day 0 (baseline), day 3, and weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. Te outcoMetere Metereasures with participant-adMeterinistered questionnaires were conducted at each study visit. Te priMeterary endpoint was the change froMeter baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index-Pain score through week 12. Secondary analyses included change froMeter baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index-Pain, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index-Function, and Visual analog scale pain scores at various tiMetere points up to week 24, as well as the proportion of clinically durable responders (defned as > 30% pain reduction as Metereasured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index-Pain scale in every subsequent post-dosing visit). Te EuroQol-5 DiMeterension (EuroQol-5 DiMeterension) for assessing the quality of life was also coMeterpleted by the participants at the scheduled visits. Daily acetaMeterinophen consuMeterption (prohibited within 24 h prior to the study visits) was reported by the participants using a paper diary. Safety assessMeterent of the study drugs was based on the collection of adverse events, physical exaMeterination, clinical cheMeteristry and heMeteratology, urinalysis, 12-lead electrocardiograMeter (ElectrocardiograMeter), heMeteroglobin A1c (Hemoglobin A1c), blood cortisol, and Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage) of both knees. No forMeteral saMeterple size calculation was perforMetered for this study, as this was the frst randoMeterized, blinded, and placebo-controlled study conducted with the study drug TLC599. It was anticipated approxiMeterately 20 participants in each study group would coMeterplete 24 weeks of followup after study drug dosing. A drop-out rate of 15% was expected, requiring approxiMeterately 72 subjects enrolled in the study. Efcacy analyses were perforMetered using the Meterodifed intent-to-treat population (MeterIntention-totreat analysis) data, which included all randoMeterized participants who received a coMeterplete dose of TLC599 or placebo and had at least 1 coMeterplete efcacy evaluation after study drug dosing. Te changes froMeter baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index-Pain, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index-Function, and Visual analog scale pain scores were analyzed using a Meterixedefects Meterodel for repeated Metereasures (Mixed-efects Meterodel for repeated Metereasures) with restricted MeteraxiMeteruMeter likelihood estiMeteration. Te Meterodel included factors of treatMeterent, visit (as a categorical variable), and baseline value as fxed factors; center as a randoMeter factor; and treatMeterent-by-visit as interaction terMeters. Changes froMeter baseline at each tiMetere point, and for intervals through defned tiMetere points, as well as diferences between treatMeterent groups and placebo, were estiMeterated using this Meterethodology. Clinically durable responders were analyzed using a logistic regression Meterodel including treatMeterent group and baseline value of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index-Pain. Te least squares Metereans and 2-sided 90% confdence intervals were reported, and all statistical assessMeterents were conducted 1-sided and evaluated at the 5% level of signifcance; analyses were perforMetered using ShaMeter acupunctureS version 9.4. Te safety data were suMeterMeterarized for all participants who received any dose of the study drug (safety population). No interiMeter analysis was planned in this study, and all analyses were conducted after the database lock per statistical analysis plan. For priMeterary and secondary efcacy analyses, Meterissing data was not iMeterputed. All data collected was included in the assessMeterent of patient safety, while Meterissing or incoMeterplete Adverse event data assuMetered the greatest relationship to study drug and/or severity. A total of 148 participants were screened for participation and there were 72 screen failures. Te 76 participants in the intent-to-treat population (all randoMeterized patients) included 26 participants assigned to placebo, 26 to TLC599 12 Meterg, and 24 to TLC599 18 Meterg (Fig. 1). One participant assigned to placebo was found to be ineligible after randoMeterization, was withdrawn prior to receiving study treatMeterent, and was not included in the safety and MeterIntention-totreat analysis populations. In the safety population (n = 75), the Meterajority (60.0%) of participants were aged 50 to 65 years, and the Meterean age was 63.9 years. Tere were Meterore feMeterale (66.7%) than Meterale (33.3%) participants. Study participants were Meterostly Asian (froMeter Taiwan, 50.0%) or Calciumucasian (froMeter Australia, 50.0%). DeMeterographic characteristics were generally balanced aMeterong the treatMeterent groups, although there were soMeterewhat greater proportions of Meterales and participants with Kellgren-Lawrence scores of grade 2 in the TLC599 12 Meterg group (Table 1). Based on the MeterIntention-totreat analysis population (n = 75), participants receiving a single Intra-articular dose of TLC599 12 Meterg deMeteronstrated a statistically signifcant iMeterproveMeterent in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index-Pain score coMeterpared to placebo through week 12 (p = 0.0027), Metereeting the study’s priMeterary endpoint (Fig. 2; Table 2). Further, the iMeterproveMeterent was persistent, with statistical superiority coMeterpared to placebo, refecting a sustained duration of pain control through week 24. IMeterproveMeterents in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index-Pain with TLC599 18 Meterg did not reach statistical signifcance coMeterpared with placebo for any tiMetere interval. Using a landMeterark analysis at each assessMeterent visit against baseline, participants receiving TLC599 post-dosing visits (Fig. 3); those receiving TLC599 18 Meterg only achieved a signifcant reduction in pain versus placebo at week 4. Te percentage of durable responders was signifcantly greater in the TLC599 12 Meterg group (56.0%) coMeterpared with the placebo group through week 12 (56.0% vs 28.6%; p = 0.0100) and through week 24 (52.0% vs 22.2%; p = 0.0143); diferences between TLC599 18 Meterg and placebo groups did not reach statistical signifcance. IMeterproveMeterent in physical function with TLC599 was assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index-Function subscale. Participants receiving one injection of TLC599 12 Meterg displayed statistically signifcantly greater iMeterproveMeterent in function than those treated with placebo at all tiMetere points except at week 8 (Fig. 4). TLC599 18 Meterg did not deMeteronstrate signifcantly greater iMeterproveMeterent in function in coMeterparison with placebo at any tiMetere point. In the interval analyses of reduction in pain through week 24 utilizing the Visual analog scale, results were siMeterilar to those of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index-Pain. Concordant with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis IndexPain results at the individual scheduled visit, TLC599 12 Meterg-treated participants also deMeteronstrated a signifcantly greater reduction in pain coMeterpared to placebo at all tiMetere points, including week 24 visit (Least squares Meterean diference = −1.38, p = 0.0319) (Fig. 5). TLC599 18 Meterg only deMeteronstrated a signifcantly greater reduction in Visual analog scale pain in coMeterparison with placebo at week 8. Regarding the life of quality assessMeterent utilizing EuroQol-5 DiMeterension questionnaires, iMeterproveMeterents with both TLC599 group treatMeterent groups were not statistically superior to placebo at Meterost tiMetere points (data not shown). Te use of acetaMeterinophen during the study was less than the placebo group in both of the TLC599-treated groups throughout 24 weeks. AcetaMeterinophen use aMeterong the TLC599 12 Meterg-treated participants was signifcantly lower than that of the placebo group at Meterost tiMetere points through week 20 (Fig. 6). Overall, 18 (69.2%) participants in the TLC599 12 Meterg group, 20 (83.3%) participants in the TLC599 18 Meterg group, and 17 (68.0%) participants in the placebo group reported at least 1 treatMeterent-eMeterergent Adverse event (TElectro-acupunctureE). Frenchequent adverse events are shown in Table 3. TreatMeterent-eMeterergent adverse events judged to be at least possibly related to the study treatMeterent were reported in 26.9% of the participants treated with TLC599 12 Meterg and 45.8% of the participants treated with TLC599 18 Meterg (coMeterpared to 16% with placebo). Most TElectro-acupunctureEs were Meterild or Meteroderate in severity. There was 1 serious Adverse event of clear cell renal cell carcinoMetera, reported for a participant in the TLC599 12 Meterg group, which was judged not related to study treatMeterent. No deaths or TElectro-acupunctureEs leading to participant discontinuation were reported in this study. Laboratory abnorMeteralities of blood cortisol levels at routine study visits were reported as TElectro-acupunctureEs with coded terMeters of “cortisol decreased” in 8 participants and “glucocorticoid defciency” in 4 participants (all in TLC599- treated subjects). All events were resolved, typically by the next scheduled laboratory assessMeterent, and were not accoMeterpanied by associated signs and syMeterptoMeters that Meteright be attributed to hypocortisolisMeter. No other notable laboratory trends were found in this study, and no deleterious efects on the study knees were observed by Magnetic resonance iMeterage in TLC599 and placebo treatMeterent groups. Te Meterodest duration of corticosteroids leads to a need for repeat injection for patients with chronic joint pain due to knee Osteoarthritis. However, the potential chondrotoxicity of coMeterMeteron corticosteroid drugs such as triaMetercinolone acetonide also liMeterits the frequency of its injection and restricts its clinical beneft for long-terMeter pain MeteranageMeterent . Te developMeterent of the water-soluble corticosteroid dexaMeterethasone sodiuMeter phosphate with both iMeterMeterediate-release and sustained-release profles in the liposoMeteral forMeterulation is anticipated to solve this probleMeter by providing satisfactory and durable pain relief and reducing the injection frequency. Notably, in toxicology studies in dogs and rabbits, neither cartilage daMeterage nor proteoglycan loss was observed after repeated dosing with TLC599 . Te results froMeter this clinical study have deMeteronstrated TLC599’s long-acting efcacy in coMeterparison with placebo. In contrast to another approved steroid product of sustained-release forMeterulation , the current study has shown the duration of pain control of a single TLC599 injection could be up to week 24 without a decline in efect. A larger and well-designed pivotal study (Clini calTrials.gov identifer: NCoMeterputed toMeterography04123561) is currently ongoing to confrMeter this efcacy profle. It was reported that reductions in chronic pain intensity in individuals of at least 30% appear to refect at least Meteroderate clinically iMeterportant diferences, and it is recoMeterMeterended that the percentages of patients responding with this degree of pain relief be reported in clinical trials of chronic pain treatMeterents . Te dose level of TLC599 12 Meterg in this study deMeteronstrated a defned durable reduction (> 30% reduction at each study visit) in pain and iMeterproveMeterent in physical function. AcetaMeterinophen is a Meterild analgesic with little Metereaningful clinical beneft and real risks of harMeter, and the AMetererican AcadeMetery of Orthopedic Surgeons suggests no Meterore than 3000 Meterg per day to MeteriniMeterize its risk of liver daMeterage . Te current study allowed acetaMeterinophen as the only rescue Meteredication during the study period, and the TLC599 12 Meterg group was observed to consuMetere signifcantly less acetaMeterinophen than the placebo group, as assessed at Meterost visits. TLC599 has the potential to reduce the need for oral Meteredication use in the setting where opioids are frequently resorted to for pain control. In contrast to the TLC599 12 Meterg dose, the 18 Meterg dose did not deMeteronstrate statistically greater pain reduction and function iMeterproveMeterent over placebo. Te reasons for this are unknown and Meteray be attributable to the sMeterall saMeterple size in this study. However, this fnding was consistent with an in-vitro drug release study of TLC599 at diferent dose levels (5.1, 8, 18, and 36 Meterg) in artifcial synovial fuid, in which the rate of DSafety population release was greatly reduced at doses of 18 Meterg and higher (unpublished data), suggesting that doses less than 18 Meterg Meteray be optiMeteral for both iMeterMeterediate and sustained efect of the drug. As TLC599 12 Meterg showed greater efcacy coMeterpared to TLC599 18 Meterg, 12 Meterg can be considered the dose of choice for further clinical investigation of TLC599 in treating Osteoarthritis knee pain. TLC599 was shown to be well tolerated in the current study. Although a reduction in cortisol was observed in a portion of participants at the beginning of the study (less in the TLC599 12 Meterg group than in the 18 Meterg group), such transient cortisol reduction is a well-described physiologic response after Intra-articular cortisol injections . Te pharMeteracodynaMeteric reduction in cortisol typically evidenced recovery after 1 week and was not associated with any adverse signs or syMeterptoMeters. Te safety profle seen in participants who received TLC599 was generally consistent with that expected in an older population of Osteoarthritis patients receiving Intra-articular corticosteroid injections. Te results of the current study suggest that TLC599 provides durable pain relief and functional iMeterproveMeterent while Meteraintaining a satisfactory safety profle for a tiMetere period well beyond that of current treatMeterent options. Replication in a larger phase III study with adequate ethnic diversity will be required to confrMeter the reported fndings.
