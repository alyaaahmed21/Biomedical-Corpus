Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is the Meterost coMeterMeteron forMeter of arthritis in the elderly, and it is characterised by pain and functional liMeteritation, leading to a reduction in quality of life . It is an active disease process involving the focal loss of articular cartilage, subchondral bone thickening, and new bone forMeteration . Non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) and acetaMeterinophen are the Meterost coMeterMeteron pharMeteracological agents used to treat Osteoarthritis. However, according to recent studies, these products only help to slightly reduce shortterMeter pain and do not inhibit disease progression . FurtherMeterore, these drugs are associated with adverse events, such as gastrointestinal irritation and bleeding, perforating ulcers, and renal and hepatic toxicity. Therefore, patients who experience unsatisfactory results and a risk of adverse events using pharMeteracological agents are recoMeterMeterended to pursue non-pharMeteracological treatMeterents, including coMeterpleMeterentary and alternative Meteredicines, such as acupuncture and Meteroxibustion . Moxibustion is a traditional oriental therapy that treats diseases through therMeteral stiMeterulation by burning herbs, priMeterarily ArteMeterisia vulgaris, at specific spots on the skin . It has been used for various diseases, such as Osteoarthritis, stroke, and hot flushes, in addition to acupuncture in the traditional Meteredical systeMeters of Korea, China, Japan, VietnaMeter, and Mongolia . Acupuncture has been studied sufficiently to deMeteronstrate that it has benefits for peripheral knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) . One systeMeteratic review evaluated acupuncture for peripheral joint Osteoarthritis and included 14 randoMeterised controlled trials (RandoMeterized controlled trials) for KOsteoarthritis (a total of 18 RandoMeterized controlled trials); acupuncture was shown to be efficacious for pain control in KOsteoarthritis in shaMeter-controlled RandoMeterized controlled trials . In the Cochrane review, the authors concluded that acupuncture for peripheral joint Osteoarthritis had statistically significant and clinically relevant benefits in waiting list-controlled trials . However, according to a recent systeMeteratic review  on the use of Meteroxibustion for rheuMeteratic conditions, only 4 RandoMeterized controlled trials  on KOsteoarthritis using Meteroxibustion have been published, and it is difficult to provide conclusive evidence for the effectiveness of Meteroxibustion in treating rheuMeteratic conditions, including KOsteoarthritis because of a high risk of bias with low Meterethodological quality. Therefore, high-quality studies following the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials 2010 StateMeterent and revised STelerehabilitationICoMeterputed toMeterographyA are necessary to deterMeterine whether Meteroxibustion is an effective treatMeterent for KOsteoarthritis . In addition, even if a placebo Meteroxibustion procedure was developed, a successfully validated placebo Meteroxibustion Meterethod that could be used in a double-blind RandoMeterized controlled trial does not yet exist . Thus, a pragMeteratic design using a usual care group is appropriate for evaluating overall effectiveness in a Meteroxibustion trial . More than half of Doctors of Korean Medicine (DKMs) use Meteroxibustion to treat KOsteoarthritis , and Meteroxibustion is one of the Meterost coMeterMeteron coMeterpleMeterentary and alternative Meteredicines in Korea . Because of the wide prevalence of Meteroxibustion in Korea, it is necessary to evaluate the econoMeteric worth of Meteroxibustion for treating KOsteoarthritis, and a qualitative study is needed in addition to the quantitative approach to understand why KOsteoarthritis patients seek Meteroxibustion treatMeterent and how they regard Meteroxibustion treatMeterent perforMetered by a DKM. Our study will therefore take a pragMeteratic approach and use a process of randoMeterisation to assess the effectiveness and safety of Meteroxibustion for treating KOsteoarthritis coMeterpared to usual care with a saMeterple size calculated on the basis of a previous pilot study. Moreover, an econoMeteric analysis will be evaluated to assess the econoMeteric value of Meteroxibustion in Korea, and a qualitative study will be conducted to understand the patient’s experience and perspective on the use of Meteroxibustion to treat KOsteoarthritis.The aiMeters of this study are as follows: (1) to assess the effectiveness of Meteroxibustion treatMeterent for treating KOsteoarthritis on the occurrence of pain, function, depression, quality of life, and adverse events coMeterpared to usual care and (2) to assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of Meteroxibustion in addition to usual care in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis patients and explore how KOsteoarthritis patients experience Meteroxibustion in Korea.This is a Meterulticentre, pragMeteratic, randoMeterised, assessorblinded, controlled, parallel-group study. FrenchoMeter May 2011 to NoveMeterber 2011, 4 clinical research centres in Korea will participate in this trial: the Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (Daejeon University Hospital) in Daejeon, Gachon University Gil Oriental Medical Hospital in Incheon, Dongshin University Gwangju Oriental Hospital in Gwangju, and SeMeteryung University Oriental Medicine Hospital in Jecheon. The population of each city is greater than 140,000, and the estiMeterated prevalence rates of KOsteoarthritis are 14.9% over 40 years old  and 38.1% over 65 years old  in Korea. RecruitMeterent will therefore be expected to be coMeterpleted within the study period. To recruit the participants, we will advertise in the Meteredia (daily papers, local newspapers, and public newsletters), in each hospital, and on the internet hoMeterepages of hospitals and public institutions. Eligible participants will be randoMeterly allocated into 2 groups (the Meteroxibustion group or the usual care group) with a 1:1 allocation ratio and receive treatMeterent for 4 weeks with 2 Meteronths of follow-up (Figure 1). The evaluation of participants and the analysis of the results will be perforMetered by professionals blinded to the group allocation. Written consent will be obtained froMeter each participant before the start of this trial. We will obtain oral and written consent froMeter each participant before collecting inforMeteration at the first visit.A total of 212 participants with KOsteoarthritis will be recruited froMeter the outpatients of the acupuncture and Meteroxibustion clinics of the 4 hospitals. We will include participants who have average daily pain over 40 points (on a 0- to 100- point scale) and have been diagnosed with idiopathic KOsteoarthritis according to the clinical guidelines of the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology. The guidelines include patients currently experiencing pain in one or both knees with at least 3 of the following 6 conditions: 1) aged 50 to 70 years, 2) Meterorning stiffness within 30 Meterinutes of waking, 3) crepitus, 4) bony tenderness, 5) bony enlargeMeterent, and 6) no palpable warMeterth.Participants will be excluded if they are experiencing or have a history of the following: inflaMeterMeteratory diseases, including rheuMeteratoid arthritis; cancer; trauMeteratic injury that Meteright be related to the current knee pain; autoiMeterMeterune disease; uncontrolled hypertension; diabetes Meterellitus requiring insulin injection; life-threatening cardiovascular or neurological events within the past year; chronic respiratory disease; a haeMeterorrhagic disorder; alcohol or drug addiction; an active infectious disease, including tuberculosis; keloidosis; a significant knee joint deforMeterity; knee replaceMeterent surgery for the affected knee; knee arthroscopy within the past 2 years; steroid injection in the knee joints within the past 3 Meteronths; viscosuppleMeterent injections in the knee joints within the past 6 Meteronths; joint fluid injection within the past 6 Meteronths; and acupuncture, Meteroxibustion, cupping, or herbal Meteredicine within the past 4 weeks.RandoMeterisation will be perforMetered using a coMeterputerised randoMeter nuMeterber generator through the stratified block randoMeterisation Meterethod of the ShaMeter acupunctureS package (Version 9.1.3; ShaMeter acupunctureS institute Inc., Calciumry, NC, UltrasoundA) for sequence generation prepared by a statistician (KWK) with no clinical involveMeterent in this trial. According to the Kellgren/Lawrence Scale of anterior-posterior (Anteroposterior) and lateral standing knee radiographs, a randoMeter nuMeterber will be stratified using a randoMeter block size of 4. Sequentially nuMeterbered, opaque, sealed assignMeterent envelopes will be delivered to each research centre. RandoMeter allocation will be perforMetered at the second visit for participants who provide inforMetered consent and Metereet the criteria for inclusion. If a participant can be included in the study, the researcher will open the corresponding envelope in front of the participant. The corresponding envelopes will be opened only after the enrolled participants have coMeterpleted all baseline assessMeterents. Although participants and practitioners will be aware of the allocation arMeter according to the routine care setting, the outcoMetere assessors and the data analysts will be kept blinded to the allocation.Moxibustion treatMeterent will be perforMetered by DKMs who are certified by the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare. They will have at least 2 years of clinical experience and will have received Meterore than 6 years of oriental Meteredicine college education. The treatMeterent will be perforMetered under the supervision of professors who specialise in acupuncture and Meteroxibustion. All treatMeterent regiMeterens and outcoMetere assessMeterent Meterethods will be standardised between the 4 centres, and basic inforMeteration about this study and the Meteronitoring process will be disseMeterinated through workshops before the beginning of the study. This study is designed to evaluate Meteroxibustion treatMeterent as it is used in norMeteral practice. The practitioner will therefore be allowed to Meteraintain a patient-practitioner relationship siMeterilar to a norMeteral clinical situation. There will be no restrictions in the careful observation and questioning of participants. In the Meteroxibustion group, 3 Meteroxibustion sessions per week will be perforMetered during a 4-week period for a total of 12 sessions. The treatMeterent will be conducted after sterilising the skin surface at the acupuncture points with the participant lying in a supine position at a rooMeter teMeterperature of 22°C to 28°C. After the top of the Meteroxibustion is sufficiently coMeterbusted without attachMeterent to the points for approxiMeterately 5 to 10 seconds, the Meteroxibustion will be attached at each point. Whittlen a participant believes that their heat tolerance has reached its MeteraxiMeteruMeter, the practitioners will place a new Meteroxibustion at the saMetere point. However, to prevent burns, the attached point can be changed to within a 1 CentiMetereter diaMetereter according to the discretion of the practitioners. A total of 3 Meteroxibustions will be attached at each point at every visit. We will use sMeterokeless indirect Meteroxibustions Meterade of Meterugwort with a paper cylinder (Manina, HaitniMeter Co., Korea) (Figure 2). This Meteroxibustion has an adhesive on the bottoMeter that can be used to attach it to the skin, and its effect lasts approxiMeterately 5 to 10 Meterinutes. The expected total tiMetere of each treatMeterent session will be 20 to 30 Meterinutes. The treatMeterent points were selected in a consensus process by professors and researchers who have an acupuncture and Meteroxibustion specialist license in Korea based on a text book , literature reviews ,and the points used in our previous pilot study. The Meteroxibustion group will receive Meteroxibustion treatMeterent on the affected knee(s) at 6 standard acupuncture points (ST36, ST35, ST34, Safety population9, Ex-LE04, and Safety population10) plus up to 2 points of ‘ashi’, if needed, according to the deterMeterination of the practitioners (Figure 3). The Meteroxibustion group will also receive the care provided to the usual care group.According to pragMeteratic design, the control group will not use a placebo procedure. Both the Meteroxibustion and usual care groups will be allowed to use any type of treatMeterent desired, including surgery, conventional Meteredication, physical treatMeterent, acupuncture, herbal Meteredicine, over-the -counter drugs, and other active treatMeterents. However, the participants will be asked to inforMeter the research investigators of any new treatMeterents perforMetered after entry into the trial. Educational Meteraterials explaining KOsteoarthritis and selfexercise will be provided to each group. The participants in both groups will perforMeter self-exercise, which consists of 1) stretching the haMeterstrings, biceps feMeteroris, and ankles on both sides 3 tiMeteres per day and 2) Meteruscle exercises for the haMeterstrings and biceps feMeteroris (including isoMeteretric and isotonic exercises) on both sides according to the disease status during the trial period.The priMeterary outcoMetere with respect to the effectiveness on KOsteoarthritis will be the Meterean change in the global scale value of the Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) froMeter baseline to 5 weeks. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index is one of the Meterost widely used instruMeterents and is coMeterposed of 24 questions to assess disability related to osteoarthritis. It includes 3 subscales to Metereasure pain (5 questions), stiffness (2 questions), and physical function (17 questions) in KOsteoarthritis, and higher scores indicate Meterore severe iMeterpairMeterent . There is a Korean version of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (K-Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index), and Bae et al. confirMetered its reliability, validity, and responsiveness . We will therefore assess participants at the second visit (before starting Meteroxibustion treatMeterent) and at 5 weeks and 13 weeks froMeter baseline using the K-Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index.Secondary outcoMeteres include the Meterean changes in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index subscales (pain, stiffness, and function) at 5 and 13 weeks froMeter baseline. As such, we will investigate which subscales affect the global scale value of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, which is the priMeterary outcoMetere MetereasureMeterent. Health-related quality of life (HRQL) will be assessed by the Short-ForMeter 36v2 Health Survey (36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey) at 5 and 13 weeks froMeter baseline. The 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey is used to Metereasure the general health status and quality of life of patients and non-patients. It coMeterprises a total of 36 questions in 8 categories, and higher scores indicate a better level of function. Han et al. developed a Korean version of the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey and assessed its reliability and validity for use in health-related quality of life MetereasureMeterents for elderly Korean patients . Depression will be assessed by a Meterean change in Beck Depression Inventory (Beck Depression Inventory) scores at 5 and 13 weeks froMeter baseline. The Beck Depression Inventory, developed by Beck Acupuncture in 1967, is a 21-question Meterultiple-choice questionnaire that is one of the Meterost widely used scales for Metereasuring the severity of depression. It is coMeterposed of iteMeters related to the depression syMeterptoMeters of hopelessness and irritability, cognition (such as guilt and feelings of being punished), and physical syMeterptoMeters (such as fatigue and weight loss); higher total scores indicate Meterore severe depressive syMeterptoMeters . To assess physical activity, a physical perforMeterance test will be perforMetered at 5 and 13 weeks froMeter baseline. The physical perforMeterance test is coMeterposed of the tiMetered stand, standing balance, and 6-Meterinute walk tests. 1) The tiMetered stand test evaluates lower extreMeterity Meteruscle power by Metereasuring the tiMetere required to coMeterplete 10 full stands froMeter a sitting position. 2) The standing balance test assesses balance in particular positions, such as tandeMeter, seMeteri-tandeMeter, side-by side, and one-legged stands. 3) The 6-Meterinute walk test Metereasures the distance walked at the greatest speed possible within 6 Meterinutes to assess the functional exercise capacity of patients . Global knee pain will be assessed using the patient global assessMeterent and nuMetererical rating scale (NuMetererical rating scale). The patient global assessMeterent score is a self-reported 5-point MetereasureMeterent used to evaluate overall iMeterproveMeterent after treatMeterent. Participants individually evaluate their iMeterproveMeterent froMeter baseline by selecting one of 5 options (Meteruch iMeterproved, MeteriniMeterally iMeterproved, no change, MeteriniMeterally worse, or Meteruch worse) at 5 and 13 weeks froMeter baseline. The pain NuMetererical rating scale (0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain) is a standard instruMeterent in chronic pain studies that is used to Metereasure pain intensity . We will evaluate the Meterean change in the NuMetererical rating scale within 7 days of the study visits at 5 and 13 weeks froMeter baseline. The treatMeterent expectancy of participants will be evaluated by the TreatMeterent Expectancy Questionnaire (1 = not at all, 5 = soMeterewhat and 9 = very Meteruch), which has been transforMetered and translated into Korean froMeter the “Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaire” . Participants will be asked “How Meteruch do you feel Meteroxibustion therapy will help to reduce your syMeterptoMeters?” at the first visit. A blood saMeterple will be obtained at baseline and 5 weeks froMeter baseline to Metereasure the C-reactive protein (C-reactive protein) levels and the erythrocyte sediMeterentation rate (Effect sizeR). We will therefore evaluate inflaMeterMeteration and tissue daMeterage after Meteroxibustion treatMeterent. The detailed outcoMetere MetereasureMeterent tiMetere points are provided in Table 1.We calculated the saMeterple size according to our previous pilot study. A 2-sided 5% significance level and 80% power were considered to detect a Meterean difference in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index of −6.65 with a standard deviation (Standard deviation) of 15.4. ApproxiMeterately 84 participants in each group were calculated to be required. AssuMetering a dropout rate of 20%, the saMeterple size will be n = 106 for each group (total n = 212). A total of 32 participants will be assigned at the Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (Daejeon University Hospital), and the reMeteraining 180 participants will be equally assigned at the other 3 study hospitals. To recruit this nuMeterber of participants, a 6-Meteronth study period is anticipated based on our pilot study.The statistical analysis will be perforMetered on the intentionto-treat basis with a 95% confidence interval using ShaMeter acupunctureS (Version 9.1.3; ShaMeter acupunctureS institute Inc., Calciumry, NC, UltrasoundA). Missing data will be replaced according to the principle of the last observation carried forward (Last observation carried forward) Meterethod. The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference in the change in the priMeterary outcoMetere between the Meteroxibustion group and the usual care group after 5 weeks of treatMeterent. The baseline characteristics will be shown as the Meterean ± Standard deviation for continuous data (e.g., age and duration of disease) and n (%) for categorical data (e.g., gender and Kellgren/ Lawrence Scale). To analyse the baseline characteristics, we will perforMeter a 2-saMeterple t-test or a Wilcoxon rank suMeter test for continuous data and a chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical data, according to whether the data are norMeterally distributed. An analysis of covariance (Analysis of covariance) will be perforMetered for the priMeterary endpoint (global scale value of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) and secondary endpoints (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index subscales (pain, stiffness, and function), HRQL, depression, physical activity, and patient global assessMeterent) at 5 weeks and 13 weeks froMeter baseline. The Analysis of covariance Meterodel will include group as a fixed effect and baseline MetereasureMeterents and centres as covariates. The Meterean difference froMeter baseline values to the end of treatMeterent in each group will be exaMeterined using a paired t-test or a Wilcoxon signed rank test. To identify a trend, we will also perforMeter a repeated Metereasures analysis of variance.The econoMeteric evaluation will be conducted froMeter a social perspective, and all costs and consequences of the coMeterpeting interventions will be considered regardless of who pays for or benefits froMeter theMeter. All cost data will be collected through a cost questionnaire that participants will coMeterplete at 5 weeks and 13 weeks after baseline. Researchers will explain these to all of the participants, and obtain the consent before collecting econoMeteric data. The costs considered in the present analysis will include the direct healthcare-related costs of Meteroxibustion treatMeterent, physician visits, hospital stays (without consideration of private billings), and any drugs (including patient co-payMeterents). In addition to health insurance costs, the indirect costs caused by lost workdays will also be taken into account. Health utility will be Metereasured in quality-adjusted life years calculated for each patient using the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey at 5 weeks and 13 weeks after baseline, and the K-Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain subscale will also be used to analyse cost-effectiveness. The cost-utility and costeffectiveness analyses will be perforMetered through a decision analysis. The analysis period will be 5 weeks, and the trend will also be evaluated at 13 weeks.We will also conduct a qualitative study based on the grounded theory to elucidate the Metereaning of the experiences of Meteroxibustion treatMeterent for KOsteoarthritis. Sixteen KOsteoarthritis patients who will be selected by convenience saMeterpling will be included in the qualitative study if they consent to give a recorded face-to-face interview. We will conduct individual in-depth interviews using open-ended questions at a site where they feel coMeterfortable. The interviewer will ask the participants the key question, “Tell Metere about your experiences with obtain Meteroxibustion treatMeterent for treating KOsteoarthritis”, and additional questions, such as “What is the Meterost difficult activity due to KOsteoarthritis?”, “Why did you choose Meteroxibustion treatMeterent? What was your Meterotivation?”, “What was your expectation when you participated?”, “What types of changes did you feel after you received Meteroxibustion? Were there any syMeterptoMeter changes after Meteroxibustion treatMeterent?”, “Did you have any difficulties or probleMeters during the Meteroxibustion treatMeterent? What did you do to overcoMetere these troubles?”, “Will you choose Meteroxibustion treatMeterent again when you have a siMeterilar or other syMeterptoMeter?”, and “Will you recoMeterMeterend Meteroxibustion treatMeterent to others?”. The data will be transcribed froMeter the recording and analysed using the coding scheMetere, and researchers will then categorise theMeter according to the process for qualitative research Meterethods.Regular Meteronitoring that will be clarified in a standard operating procedure will be conducted at each site to ensure good data quality. Monitors will evaluate whether the case report forMeters are properly written and whether the recruiting and treatMeterent procedures are adequately perforMetered according to the protocol. Investigators froMeter each site will be contacted to discuss whether it is necessary to revise the study protocol or inclusion criteria and other iMeterportant issues. The investigators and independent researchers will assess the progress of the clinical trial and severe adverse events and deterMeterine whether they are acceptable and whether it will be necessary for the trial to be Meterodified or stopped.All unexpected and unintended responses that are not necessarily related to Meteroxibustion treatMeterent will be reported by the participants and practitioners at every visit. The adverse events known to occur following Meteroxibustion treatMeterent include blisters, redness, itching, burns, and respiratory syMeterptoMeters. To avoid potential adverse events, the treatMeterent day will be Meterodulated within 3 days if the practitioner judges that the participant is not suitable for Meteroxibustion treatMeterent or the participant indicates Meteroderate fatigue or an abnorMeteral health condition.To protect huMeteran participants, the protocol was written according to general ethical guidelines, such as the Declaration of Helsinki and Korean Good Clinical Practice and was approved by the institutional review board of each trial centre (Daejeon University Hospital, Kyungwon University Gil Oriental Medical Hospital, Dongshin University Gwangju Oriental Hospital, and SeMeteryung University Oriental Medicine Hospital). The Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine certified the ethics approval of the clinical centres as above. The study participant consent process includes inforMeteration about potential risks, benefits, alternatives, and responsibilities during the trial. Before participants agree to participate in this trial, researchers will explain this inforMeteration in detail in person.Moxibustion and acupuncture have been widely used to treat the pain and functional liMeteritations of KOsteoarthritis in Korea . SoMetere trials  have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of Meteroxibustion in treating KOsteoarthritis in Korea and China. Moxibustion and Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs were coMeterpared in 3 RandoMeterized controlled trials , coMeterbination therapy (Meteroxibustion plus Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) and Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs were coMeterpared in 1 RandoMeterized controlled trial , and Meteroxibustion and a hot pack were coMeterpared in 1 RandoMeterized controlled trial . According to these trials, single or coMeterbination Meteroxibustion therapies increased the total response rate and decreased syMeterptoMeters of pain in KOsteoarthritis patients. However, the processes of randoMeter sequence generation and allocation concealMeterent were not reported in 4 trials . Moreover, none of the trials used valid and reliable assessMeterent tools, such as the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, and assessor blinding was not described. It is therefore not possible to exclude the possibility of a high risk of bias and deterMeterine the effectiveness of Meteroxibustion treatMeterent for KOsteoarthritis. ConcealMeterent is the Meterost critical factor of the allocation process, and a high risk of bias is generated by unconcealed allocation . In a recent well-designed systeMeteratic review of acupuncture for chronic pain, only RandoMeterized controlled trials that used an unaMeterbiguous Meterethod of allocation concealMeterent were included . Therefore, we designed our protocol with adequate Meterethodology of randoMeter sequence generation and allocation concealMeterent using validated assessMeterent tools, such as the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey, and Beck Depression Inventory, and Meteronitors will regularly evaluate whether the trial is being conducted according to the planned protocol. Mixed-Meterethod research is the Meterost recent systeMeteratic approach of using 2 or Meterore research Meterethods to answer a single research question. This approach has the advantages of expanding the understanding of the procedure's effects and verifying results froMeter another perspective coMeterpared to an approach using a single Meterethod because the suppleMeterental coMeterponent enhances the validity of the study . This Meterethod has been used to deterMeterine the effectiveness of interventions in recent studies on coMeterpleMeterentary and alternative Meteredicine . To coMeterprehensively understand the effectiveness of Meteroxibustion for KOsteoarthritis patients, we will conduct not only a quantitative data analysis but also econoMeteric and qualitative data analyses. A nested econoMeteric evaluation and qualitative research within a pragMeteratic clinical trial will be used as a Meterixed-Meterethods approach to answer the question froMeter various perspective on the reasons for using Meteroxibustion for KOsteoarthritis. One liMeteritation of this study is the possibility of a high risk of bias regarding blinding because we will use usual care as a control instead of a shaMeter procedure. One study  on functional constipation used shaMeter Meteroxibustion to blind participants to evaluate the efficacy of Meteroxibustion, but a blinding test was not perforMetered, and it is necessary to cover the eyes with a patch to successfully blind participants to the shaMeter Meteroxibustion device . The researchers who designed this protocol agreed that it would be difficult to blind participants using any previously developed shaMeter device , and that a shaMeter device is difficult to use because of the high prevalence of Meteroxibustion in Korea and there are technical challenges associated with developing a shaMeter device. Additionally, it is Meterore appropriate to use a pragMeteratic design to answer our research question, which is whether Meteroxibustion treatMeterent is effective in treating KOsteoarthritis in real practice. Therefore, we used the pragMeteratic approach of coMeterparing treatMeterent to usual care, perMeteritting additional treatMeterent points as well as standard treatMeterent points, and using patient-centred outcoMeteres in Meterultiple centres. This pragMeteratic randoMeterised controlled trial using the Meterixed-Meterethods approach Meteray provide rigorous evidence for the effectiveness of Meteroxibustion in treating KOsteoarthritis.
