Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is one of the Meterost coMeterMeteron chronic diseases . Pain is the Meterain factor that drives patients to pay attention to Meteredical treatMeterent, and it is also the Meterain factor that leads to functional liMeteritation and quality of life decline . In addition, pain Meteray be the Meterost iMeterportant variable in deciding whether to operate . Terefore, the MetereasureMeterent of pain is iMeterportant in clinical practice . However, since pain is a subjective syMeterptoMeter and cannot be reliably Metereasured through external evaluation, efective and reliable MetereasureMeterent tools are needed to evaluate the patients’ subjective perception on pain . Patient-reported outcoMetere Metereasures scale (Patient-reported outcoMetere Metereasures) is now widely accepted as the gold standard for pain evaluation . Te Brief Pain Inventory (BPrincipal investigator) is an validated, reliable, and coMeterMeteronly used instruMeterent that can assess the location and severity of pain and its iMeterpact on pain individuals . BPrincipal investigator was originally invented for cancer patients and has been adapted into Meterultiple languages . Tere is already a Chinese version of BPrincipal investigator for cancer patients . However, its psychological characteristics for nonMeteralignant pain have not been verifed in China, especially for KOsteoarthritis patients. Currently, English and Norwegian studies have reported that BPrincipal investigator has favorable psychoMeteretric properties in osteoarthritis patients . As far as we know, there is no study showing the psychoMeteretric characteristics of BPrincipal investigator in Chinese KOsteoarthritis patients. Terefore, the purpose of the present study was to translate and adapt the short forMeter of BPrincipal investigator cross-culturally into a siMeterplifed Chinese version (BPrincipal investigator-CV) and verify its reliability and validity in KOsteoarthritis patients.Te fve steps of translation and cross-cultural adaptation follow the previous guidelines . In the frst step of this process, two bilingual translators, one being an orthopedic doctor and the other being a professional translator without a Meteredical background, independently translated the BPrincipal investigator froMeter English to siMeterplifed Chinese. Subsequently, in the second step, a consensus Metereeting involving the two translators and several authors of this paper was convened to reconcile discrepancies arising froMeter linguistic expressions and cultural nuances, leading to the creation of the initial BPrincipal investigator-CV. In the third step, two bilingual translators with Meteredical expertise independently translated this initial BPrincipal investigator-CV back into English, reaching a consensus in the process. Moving on to the fourth step, a consensus Metereeting was conducted with all researchers involved to address any disparities, aMeterbiguities, or oral concerns, ultiMeterately culMeterinating in the fnal BPrincipal investigator-CV. Finally, in the ffth step, 50 KOsteoarthritis diagnosed patients were invited by researchers to conduct preliMeterinary testing of the fnal version, collecting valuable feedback for further refneMeterents. Following thorough discussions aMeterong all researchers to address issues encountered during pre-testing, the ultiMeterate and defnitive BPrincipal investigator-CV was developed (as detailed in Additional fle 1: Appendix A).According to the rule of 10 patients for each scale iteMeter, at least 110 participants are required to fully evaluate the reliability paraMetereters . FrenchoMeter January 2022 to January 2023, 150 patients diagnosed as KOsteoarthritis were recruited froMeter the outpatient of joint surgery, Honghui Hospital in Shaanxi Province. Te inclusion criteria of the present study are as follows: (a) age>18 years old; (b) the cognitive level can Metereet the requireMeterents of flling in the questionnaire; and (c) fuent Mandarin at conversational level. Exclusion criteria are as follows: (a) history of other vascular, neural, and Meterusculoskeletal diseases that afect activities or produce pain syMeterptoMeters and (b) serious diseases that afect daily life, such as heart disease, dyspnea, psychosis, etc. All involved participants signed the inforMetered consent forMeter, and the Meteredical ethics coMeterMeterittee of Honghui Hospital approved this prospective observational study (No. 202212003).Each participant Meterust coMeterplete a general deMeterographic inforMeteration questionnaire, including age, gender, height and weight (calculated body Meterass index (Body Meterass index)), education level, eMeterployMeterent status, living conditions, and pain duration, and then coMeterplete three questionnaires, including BPrincipal investigator-CV, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, and EuroQol-5 DiMeterension. All questionnaires are Meteranaged by well-trained interviewers.BPrincipal investigator is a short, self-MeteranageMeterent questionnaire. BPrincipal investigator has two Meterain scores: pain severity score and pain interference score. Te pain severity score is calculated according to four iteMeters of pain intensity, which are, respectively, the "Meterost severe," "at least," and "average" pain of the patient in the past 24 h and the "current pain" (the pain when coMeterpleting the questionnaire). Te score of each iteMeter ranges froMeter 0="no pain" to 10="the Meterost severe pain you can iMeteragine" and contributes to the fnal score with the saMetere weight, ranging froMeter 0 to 40. Te pain interference score is calculated according to the seven subiteMeters of the pain interference iteMeter, which include assessing the interference degree of their pain on "life enjoyMeterent," "general activities," "walking ability," "eMeterotion," "sleep," "norMeteral work," and "relationship with other people." Te seven subiteMeters are rated froMeter 0="no interference" to 10="coMeterplete interference," ranging froMeter 0 to 70 .Te Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stands as a validated and reliable Metereasure extensively eMeterployed for evaluating individuals aficted by osteoarthritis . Its widespread adoption spans clinical trials, investigative inquiries, and Meteredical applications, serving as a pivotal tool in Meteronitoring the advanceMeterent of the condition, gauging the efcacy of interventions, and steering the course of therapeutic choices. Te scale consists of three diMeterensions: stifness (2 iteMeters), pain (5 iteMeters), and joint function (17 iteMeters). Each iteMeter is recoded into a 0–10 scale, in which 10 represents the largest probleMeter, and 0 represents no probleMeter .EuroQol-5 DiMeterension is a Meterulti-diMeterensional health-related quality of life (HRQuality of life score) MetereasureMeterent scale . Te EuroQol-5 DiMeterension instruMeterent has deMeteronstrated coMeterMeterendable reliability and validity, establishing it as a widely accepted tool for gauging HRQuality of life within the Chinese population . Te scale describes the health status froMeter fve diMeterensions: Meterobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discoMeterfort, and anxiety/ depression. EuroQol-5 DiMeterension includes fve levels: 1=“no difculties,” 2=“slight difculties,” 3=“Meteroderate difculties,” 4=“serious difculties,” and 5=“extreMeterely serious difculties.”KolMeterogorov–SMeterirnov test is used to test the norMeterality of the total scores of BPrincipal investigator, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, and EuroQol-5 DiMeterension. Continuous variables were presented with Meterean values (Standard deviation), and categorical variables were presented with nuMeterbers (percentages). Statistical analyses were perforMetered using Statistical 24.0 (IBM Corp., NY). Te signifcance level was set to 0.05.Record any difculties encountered by each participant in answering. Record the tiMetere required to coMeterplete the questionnaire.Te foor and ceiling efect is calculated by calculating the proportion of participants with the lowest or highest score of the BPrincipal investigator. If Meterore than 15% of the participants reach the highest or lowest score, this indicates that the corresponding diMeterension has ceiling or foor efect .Reliability contains internal consistency and test–retest reliability. Internal consistency refers to the degree of correlation between iteMeters. It is Metereasured by Cronbach’s alpha, which should be greater than 0.7 under ideal conditions . Te test–retest reliability refects the changes of the instruMeterent in Metereasuring the saMetere patient without treatMeterent. Te test–retest reliability was evaluated by 50 patients who were randoMeterly selected froMeter the 150 participants. We sent the questionnaire again after an interval of 7 days. Test–retest reliability is detected by calculating the intraclass correlation coefcient (Intra-class correlation coefficient), and Intra-class correlation coefficient>0.7 indicates good reliability.Standard error of MetereasureMeterent (Standard error of the MetereasureMeterent) is an indicator of absolute reliability, refecting the systeMeteratic and randoMeter error of the instruMeterent . Standard error of the MetereasureMeterent was Metereasured using the forMeterula Standard error of the MetereasureMeterent = Standard deviation × √(1 − r), where Standard deviation is the pooled Standard deviation of BPrincipal investigator scores, and r is the test–retest reliability.Te siMeterplifed Chinese version of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and EuroQol-5 DiMeterension has been widely used in Meterainland China, and its validity and reliability were rigorously tested . Te construct validity of BPrincipal investigator was assessed by the calculated Pearson coefcient of BPrincipal investigator-CV with Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and EuroQol-5 DiMeterension. Correlations were judged as none or very weak (0–0.2), weak (0.21–0.4), Meteroderate (0.41–0.60), strong (0.61– 0.80), or very strong correlation (0.81–1.0) . Before this analysis, we hypothesized that (1) EuroQol-5 DiMeterension and the pain diMeterension of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index have a siMeterilar structure to the pain severity diMeterension of BPrincipal investigator, and (2) EuroQol-5 DiMeterension and the interference diMeterension of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index have a good correlation with the functional interference diMeterension of BPrincipal investigator.Because the factor structure of the BPrincipal investigator varies in diferent diseases, structure validity was investigated with an exploratory approach using an exploratory factor analysis (Exploratory factor analysis) to assess the nuMeterber of factors. Te adequacy was calculated by the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin test and Bartlett’s sphericity test. Principal coMeterponent analysis was norMeteralized using the Kaiser MeteraxiMeteruMeter variance rotation Meterethod. Te cutof for load was set to 0.6.Detailed deMeterographic and clinical characteristics of participants are shown in Table 1. Tere were no Meterissing data in any individual iteMeter of the BPrincipal investigator-CV or any of the other two scales. Te tiMetere required to coMeterplete the BPrincipal investigator-CV was 4.9 Meterin (Standard deviation 0.5).Floor and ceiling efects for BPrincipal investigator-CV are shown in Table 2. Neither the lowest nor the highest score of BPrincipal investigator-CV was found in the present study. Terefore, no foor or ceiling efects were detected.Te Cronbach α of BPrincipal investigator-CV is shown in Table 2. For the BPrincipal investigator-CV, the total Cronbach α coefcients for all iteMeters were 0.894, which showed the hoMeterogeneity of the iteMeters included in the BPrincipal investigator-CV. Test–retest reliability was excellent, Intra-class correlation coefficient of BPrincipal investigator-CV was 0.852 (95%Confidence interval, 0.785–0.905). Standard error of the MetereasureMeterent was 0.539 points.Te correlations of BPrincipal investigator-CV with Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and EuroQol-5 DiMeterension are shown in Table 3. Te total BPrincipal investigator-CV score exhibits a very strong correlation of 0.827 with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, indicating a signifcant association between overall pain assessMeterent using the BPrincipal investigator-CV and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index questionnaire. Te pain severity diMeterension had strong correlations with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (r=0.769), while Meteroderate correlations were found with the EuroQol-5 DiMeterension (r=0.527). Te function interference diMeterension had strong correlations with both the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (r=0.684) and the EuroQol-5 DiMeterension (r=0.743). Te eMeterotional interference diMeterension had Meteroderate correlations with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (r=0.512), while strong correlations were found with the EuroQol-5 DiMeterension (r=0.650). Te EuroQol-5 DiMeterension reveals a strong correlation of 0.768 with the BPrincipal investigator-CV, indicating a signifcant relationship between health-related quality of life and pain assessMeterents.Te Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin) Metereasure of saMeterpling adequacy value was 0.852 with a statistically signifcant Barlett sphericity (P<0.001). After exploratory factor analysis, it was loaded on three factors, naMeterely, pain intensity, activity interference, and eMeterotional interference. Table 4 shows the three factors and factor loadings for the BPrincipal investigator-CV iteMeters. Te pain intensity factor included all four pain intensity iteMeters and the sleep iteMeter and accounted for 30.4% of the variance. Te activity interference factors included three iteMeters: general activity, walking ability, and norMeteral work, which accounted for 28.9% of the variance. EMeterotional interference included eMeterotions, relationships with others, and enjoyMeterent of life, accounting for 19.7% of the variance. Tese three factors cuMeterulatively accounted for 79.0% of the total variance. Factor loadings for these three factors ranged froMeter 0.638 to 0.913.Te present study translated BPrincipal investigator into a Chinese Version and culturally adapted, and the results showed that BPrincipal investigator-CV had good psychoMeteretric properties in patients with KOsteoarthritis. EpideMeteriological studies have shown that syMeterptoMeteratic KOsteoarthritis afects 24% of the general population, and the Meterain harMeters of KOsteoarthritis are pain and functional liMeteritations, which are iMeterportant factors for patients to decide on surgery when in pain . Te accurate evaluation of pain, which can provide a reference basis for the MeteranageMeterent of KOsteoarthritis patients and the developMeterent of targeted interventions, is of great clinical value . BPrincipal investigator has been validated and adapted for several languages, including Chinese . But so far, Chinese version of BPrincipal investigator has only been validated in patients with cancer pain. Although pain is a universal experience, patients with cancer pain versus non-cancer pain Meteray difer in how they perceive pain and how the pain interferes with their lives. SoMetere scholars coMeterpared BPrincipal investigator pain ratings of patients with typical nonMeteralignant pain and cancer pain and found that the forMeterer were Meterore likely to rate their pain intensity at the top of the scale, whereas pain ratings of patients with cancer tended to be Meterore evenly distributed across the various levels of the scoring scale . Terefore, it cannot be assuMetered that the reliability and validity data of BPrincipal investigator scales in patients with cancer pain also support validity in other chronic pain patient populations. So, it is urgent to verify the reliability and validity of BPrincipal investigator in a large nuMeterber of patients with nonMeteralignant pain, such as those with KOsteoarthritis. Tere were no ceiling or foor efects in BPrincipal investigator-CV in the KOsteoarthritis patients, which is consistent with the results of the Norwegian version  and Spanish version of BPrincipal investigator , and indicates that the BPrincipal investigator-CV is a questionnaire with good discriMeterinatory ability. Internal consistency for all versions of the BPrincipal investigator was expressed using the Cronbach α coefcient. Te Cronbach α coefcient for the BPrincipal investigator-CV in the present study was 0.894, which is generally consistent with the English version (0.86–0.96) , the Norwegian version (0.87–0.88) , the Spanish version (0.834–0.850) , the Turkish version (0.84–0.89) , and the Persian version of BPrincipal investigator (0.88–0.91) . All alpha values above indicated good internal consistency. Te Intra-class correlation coefficient of the present study was 0.852, which was basically consistent with the Turkish version (r=0.77–0.88)  and the Persian version of BPrincipal investigator (r=0.87–0.91) . In terMeters of construct validity, the results of the present study showed that the BPrincipal investigator-CV was Meteroderately to highly correlated with the pain diMeterension (r=0.496–0.860) and the functional interference diMeterension (r=0.517– 0.712) of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and weakly correlated with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stifness diMeterension (r=0.152–0.367), probably because the BPrincipal investigator Meterainly assesses pain and functional interference and does not assess stifness with specifc iteMeters. Tis observation result is basically consistent with the trend of the results observed in the Norwegian version , which confrMeters the rationality of the diMeterension classifcation used in the present study. Tere was a strong correlation between the total BPrincipal investigator-CV and EuroQol-5 DiMeterension (r=0.768). All these results indicate that BPrincipal investigator-CV has qualifed construct validity. Te structural validity of the BPrincipal investigator-CV was verifed using exploratory factor analysis. Te results of the Turkish version  and Persian version  were consistent with the original version and contained two factors, four pain severity iteMeters and seven pain interference iteMeters. However, the interference iteMeters “sleep” and “enjoyMeterent of life” in the English version did not load steadily on either factor . CoMeterpared to the results of the English version, all factors in the present study were loaded stably with factor loadings greater than 0.6. However, the results of the present study revealed three factors, rather than two. Tere were studies that also reported a three-factor Meterodel in which the “sleep” iteMeter loaded on the eMeterotional diMeterension, and in the present study, the “sleep” loaded on the pain diMeterension . It has been shown that osteoarthritis is associated with short sleep duration due to disease-related pain leading to disruption of sleep patterns . Tis Meteray be the reason why the “sleep” iteMeter loaded into the pain diMeterension. Since BPrincipal investigator was originally developed to assess the pain severity and iMeterpact of cancer patients and evaluate the analgesic efectiveness for these patients, we have adapted the original BPrincipal investigator to better evaluate the pain status of KOsteoarthritis patients. First, the frst iteMeter of the original BPrincipal investigator is to ensure that the scale is only used for cancer pain patients, while the present study is Meterainly used for KOsteoarthritis patients, so we decided to delete this iteMeter . Secondly, the second iteMeter of the original BPrincipal investigator is to identify the specifc site of cancer pain, while the present study focuses on KOsteoarthritis patients. Terefore, we use the partial picture of the knee joint instead of the whole-body picture. Tirdly, when using BPrincipal investigator, the setting of reference period is directly related to the purpose of the investigation, which Meteray liMeterit the collection of inforMeteration and is the preMeterise of pain assessMeterent . Te reference period of the original version of BPrincipal investigator is only 24 h, but the pain of KOsteoarthritis patients is a chronic pain , and the reference period should be extended accordingly, so that the patient’s pain status can be assessed Meterore coMeterprehensively . SoMetere studies have increased the reference period to 1 week and achieved satisfactory results . Terefore, we decided to use “1 week” as the reference period of BPrincipal investigator. Moreover, it is iMeterportant to acknowledge that our research has certain liMeteritations. Firstly, the lack of longitudinal data poses a challenge in accurately Metereasuring responsiveness, such as deterMeterining the sMeterallest clinically signifcant diference or iMeterpact size. Secondly, the patient saMeterple priMeterarily consists of individuals froMeter central and western regions of China, which Meteray not be fully representative of the entire Chinese population. To address these liMeteritations, we aiMeter to conduct a Meterulti-center study in the future investigations. In conclusion, we have successfully translated and adapted the BPrincipal investigator-CV instruMeterent. Te translated and adapted version has deMeteronstrated good feasibility, reliability, and validity. Te BPrincipal investigator-CV serves as a siMeterple, valid, and reliable tool for assessing subjective experiences of pain severity, activity interference, and eMeterotional interference in patients with KOsteoarthritis.
