Recent estiMeterates suggest that syMeterptoMeteratic knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) occurs in 13% of persons aged 60 and over . The risk of Meterobility disability (defined as needing help walking or cliMeterbing stairs) attributable to knee Osteoarthritis alone is greater than that due to any other Meteredical condition in people aged 65 and over . Current clinical MeteranageMeterent for Osteoarthritis is often liMeterited to analgesic Meteredication and cautious waiting  for the soMeteretiMeteres eventual referral for total joint replaceMeterent. There are no proven therapies that Meterodify the structural changes in osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis). Given current clinical need and the anticipated increase in prevalence, a treatMeterent that prevents Osteoarthritis progression could have a profound effect on productivity, use of health services and overall quality of life for persons with Osteoarthritis. A nuMeterber of different intraarticular preparations are in developMeterent for potential use in this regard . EptoterMeterin alfa, also called huMeteran bone Meterorphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7), was originally isolated froMeter bone based on its ability to induce new bone forMeteration in vivo when coMeterbined with an appropriate physical support for Meteratrix cellular attachMeterent. The recoMeterbinant huMeteran forMeter of this is referred to as bone Meterorphogenetic protein 7 (BMP-7). BMP-7 is a MetereMeterber of the transforMetering growth factor (TransgenicF)-b superfaMeterily that contributes to eMeterbryonic developMeterent and the repair of Meterature tissues . BMPs signal via transMetereMeterbrane serine/threonine kinase receptors . They can induce a plethora of different cellular effects ranging froMeter steMeter cell Meteraintenance, Meterigration, differentiation, proliferation to apoptosis. The Meterolecular MeterechanisMeter, by which the saMetere ligand induces these Meteranifold effects, depends on the cellular context. It is a potent bone-inducing Meterolecule that has been used therapeutically to enhance bone forMeteration in spinal fusions and during fracture repair. In these clinical settings this product has been generally well tolerated. BMP-7 has also been shown to have reparative effects on cartilage. The biological effects of BMP-7 on cartilage include stiMeterulation of proteoglycan, collagen and hyaluronic acid synthesis; induction of receptors, prevention of catabolisMeter of cartilage coMeterponents by catabolic factors such as interleukin (Interleukin)-1, but no effect on chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation . CoMeterpared with norMeteral cartilage, Osteoarthritis cartilage has decreased levels of BMP-7 . Osteoarthritis cartilage explants contain up-regulated receptors for BMP-7, and addition of BMP-7 to huMeteran Osteoarthritis cartilage explants results in anabolic activity by increasing extracellular Meteratrix production . Preclinical studies supported this biologic rationale . The priMeterary objective of this Phase 1 study was to deterMeterine the safety and tolerability as well as dose-liMeteriting toxicity (Deep learningT) and MeteraxiMeteral tolerated dose (Muscle thicknessD) of intra-articular BMP-7. Secondary objectives were to deterMeterine the proportion of participants with a 20%, 50%, and 70% iMeterproveMeterent in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) pain and function subscales at 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks.This was a double-blind, randoMeterized, placebo-controlled, single-dose escalation safety study consisting of 4 dosing cohorts. Each cohort was to consist of 8 treated participants, with treatMeterent allocation in a 3:1 active to placebo ratio. The study was conducted at three sites in the Ultrasound; 2 sites in Boston, Massachusetts and one in Chapel Hill, North Calciumrolina. The local HuMeteran Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee at each site approved the study and all participants provided written inforMetered consent. The study was prospectively registered with the NIH Clinical Trials Registry NCoMeterputed toMeterography00456157.To be eligible for study participation, a patient had to Metereet all of the following criteria: 1.

Participants who Meteret all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria were randoMeterized into the first cohort of 8 participants to receive either 1.0 MeterL lactose (placebo) (2 participants) or 1.0 MeterL containing 0.03 Meterg of BMP-7(6 participants) intraarticularly in an outpatient setting on Day 1. Dose selection was based upon preclinical studies in aniMeterals. After an observation period of at least 1 hour, participants were released and contacted via telephone on Day 2 to query for adverse events (Adverse events) and concoMeteritant Meteredications. Additional follow-up visits were on Days 7, 14, 28, 56, 84 and 168. We did not see participants on Day 2 however all participants were seen by a physician who perforMetered the physical exaMeterination at each of the listed visits. After the first and subsequent cohorts of 8 participants each coMeterpleted through Day 28, the data were reviewed by the Safety CoMeterMeterittee (an independent Meteronitor, Principal Investigators froMeter each site and the Study Sponsor) and when deeMetered appropriate, the next cohort of 8 participants was treated with the next highest dose of BMP-7. The pre-planned dose escalation was 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 Meterg BMP-7 intra-articularly. Each cohort was randoMeterized in a 3:1 treatMeterent-to-lactose (placebo) ratio. RandoMeterization to lactose (placebo) or study drug was handled by a call-in randoMeterization process. The investigational pharMeteracist was unblinded to study drug assignMeterent. Preparation of study drug and lactose (placebo) occurred in the pharMeteracies which were then transported to the treatMeterent area in 3-MeterL syringes that appeared identical regardless of whether they contained OP-1 or lactose (placebo).Active TreatMeterent: RecoMeterbinant HuMeteran BMP-7 (bone Meterorphogenetic protein -7) was supplied as a lyophilized cake in 6-MeterL vials containing 1 Meterg. Reconstitution with 1.0 MeterL sterile water for injection (WFI) resulted in a solution containing 1 Meterg/MeterL BMP-7 in 5% lactose (weight/voluMetere). BMP-7 was diluted as needed per dose cohort in 5% lactose. Lactose (placebo) Control: The lactose (placebo) was provided in a 6-MeterL vial containing a sterile lyophilized cake of lactose. It was reconstituted with sterile WFI to produce a dosage of 5% lactose in 1.0 MeterL. AdMeterinistration: Given under direct ultrasound or fluoroscopic guidance to ensure injection into the knee joint. Handling and preparation of BMP-7 drug product and lactose (placebo) were carried out by institution staff in such a way as to Meteraintain study blinding, except that the study pharMeteracist was unblinded to each participant’s study treatMeterent. The institutional pharMeteracists at each site had access to a code list identifying whether the participant received BMP-7 or lactose (placebo). The pharMeteracist did not disclose this inforMeteration to any study personnel. BMP-7 was provided in a single dose 6-MeterL vial containing a sterile, lyophilized cake of BMP-7. The participant, study site personnel (other than the research pharMeteracist), and Stryker Biotech study staff were all blinded to the treatMeterent assignMeterents.Whittlen a MeteriniMeteruMeter of 4 weeks had elapsed since the last participant of the current cohort had been treated, all safety data were collected and reviewed by the safety coMeterMeterittee. Only after the current dose level had been judged to be safe were participants enrolled into the next cohort and dose escalation occurred. Study sites paid particular heed to the developMeterent of any of the following: • Any evidence of ectopic bone forMeteration not norMeterally associated with Osteoarthritis. • New or worsening erytheMetera, inflaMeterMeteration and/or joint swelling of the index knee in the first 14 days (2 weeks) following study drug injection. • The developMeterent of an inflaMeterMeteratory infusion in the index knee with WBC > 3,000/MeterMeter3 and greater than 30% polyMeterorphonuclear leukocytes. • Any serious adverse event thought to be at least possibly related to study drug During the screening period lasting 1 to 28 days, participants provided Meteredical and arthritis history, including the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index questionnaire , the Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score survey , 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey  and Visual analog scale global assessMeterents. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index is a disease specific Metereasure that includes pain (5 iteMeters) and physical function (17 iteMeters) subscales that are assessed on a 5-point Likert scale for each. The OsteoarthritisRSI Standing CoMeterMeterittee for Clinical Trials Response Criteria Initiative had developed two sets of responder criteria to present the results of changes after treatMeterent in three syMeterptoMeteratic doMeterains (pain, function, and patient’s global assessMeterent) as a single variable for clinical trials with response defined by both a relative and an absolute change . At each visit concoMeteritant Meteredications were recorded, physical exaMeterination perforMetered, saMeterples obtained for urinalysis, heMeteratology, cheMeteristry, iMeterMeterunology and seruMeter and plasMetera banked for bioMeterarker testing. ElectrocardiograMeter, bilateral knee x-rays was obtained on all participants and an Magnetic resonance iMeterage of the index knee in selected participants was done. At each of the study visits, the following clinical laboratory evaluations were perforMetered: • HeMeteratology: WBC count, Red blood cell count, heMeteroglobin, heMeteratocrit, platelet count, WBC differential count. • Coagulation: Pain threshold, aPain thresholdT, INR • Clinical cheMeteristry: AlbuMeterin, alkaline phosphatase, Alanine aMeterinotransferase (SGeneral practitionerT), TransaMeterinase (SGenetics of osteoarthritisT), bicarbonate, bilirubin (total), calciuMeter, phosphorus, chloride, creatinine, glucose, potassiuMeter, sodiuMeter, total protein, urea (Blood urea nitrogen), uric acid. • Urinalysis: Color, appearance, specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, ketones, blood, Metericroscopic exaMeterination (Red blood cell, WBC, casts, crystals). At each visit, patient saMeterples were screened for antiBMP 7 IgM and IgG antibodies. Anti- BMP 7 neutralizing activity was deterMeterined only in saMeterples positive for anti- BMP 7 binding antibodies. Blood saMeterples for seruMeter were obtained just prior to injection, iMeterMeterediately post-injection, 1 hour post-injection and at the 7 day visit to assess BMP 7 drug levels. Participants were asked to Meteraintain their usual dose of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs and/or analgesic during the course of the trial, except during the 48 hour period preceding Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score, Synovial fuid36 and patient global assessMeterent evaluations (AcetoMeterinophen was perMeteritted during this 48 hour window). Pennation angle and lateral views of the index knee were taken serially in follow-up at Days 28, 84 and 168. At the screening visit, bilateral x-rays were done to deterMeterine presence of osteophytes, to deterMeterine study eligibility. Follow-up x-rays were perforMetered on the index knee only. X-rays were perforMetered in the 3 recruiting centres and sent for central reading to a Meterusculoskeletal radiologist with osteoarthritis expertise. Participants enrolled at the Boston sites also had an Magnetic resonance iMeterage acquired to assess gadoliniuMeter enhanced Magnetic resonance iMeterage of their treated knee for dGEMagnetic resonance iMeterageC. Magnetic resonance iMeterage results were exploratory and given concerns over saMeterple size, adequate powering and also the fact that we did not find anything (either favourable or adverse) these are not further presented due to space liMeteritations.The priMeterary objective of this study was to deterMeterine the safety and tolerability including laboratory assessMeterents, iMeterMeterunogenicity data and radiographic assessMeterents. All participants receiving any part of at least one injection of BMP-7 or lactose (placebo) were evaluated for safety. The safety analyses included evaluation of the incidence of treatMeterent eMeterergent adverse events by preferred terMeter and body systeMeter. Laboratory Metereasures were coMeterpared with their corresponding norMeteral ranges, and the incidence of abnorMeterally high and of abnorMeterally low laboratory values was calculated for each relevant protocol-specified laboratory test. Fixed flexion Pennation angle and lateral x-rays of the index knee for assessMeterent of joint space narrowing, osteophyte changes and ectopic bone forMeteration were perforMetered. As this was priMeterarily a safety study no forMeteral a-priori power calculation was conducted for secondary endpoints of efficacy. Secondary objectives were to deterMeterine the proportion of participants with a 20%, 50%, and 70% iMeterproveMeterent in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain and function subscales at 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. Other secondary outcoMeteres included the change froMeter baseline to 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks for the OsteoarthritisRSI responder criteria. As this was a Phase 1 study, descriptive statistics (average, standard deviations, MeteriniMeteruMeter, MeteraxiMeteruMeter, proportions, and confidence intervals) were used to report study data and no forMeteral statistical techniques have been applied to the data.The deMeterographic characteristics of the study saMeterple were broadly consistent between the dosing and placebo cohorts (Table 1). The total study population had a Meterean age of 59.8 years, a Meterean Body Meterass index of 34.2 kg/Meter2 and was 73% feMeterale. There were no apparent differences in the cohorts recruited froMeter each site. The Meterean Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score (possible range 0-20) was 8.6 for the active treatMeterent groups vs 8.63 for the placebo group. The Meterean Kellgren and Lawrence Grade at Baseline was 2.8 in the active group vs 3.4 for the placebo group. The Meterean duration of illness for the placebo group was 9.1 years and active 3.9 years. An additional participant was inadvertently recruited into the first 0.03 Meterg cohort as the notification to the study centers that this cohort was coMeterpletely recruited occurred after this participant was screened and enrolled. Most adverse events in the study were categorized as Meterild or Meteroderate and there were no overall differences in adverse event rates between BMP-7 and placebo groups (Table 2). Two adverse events were categorized as severe and unrelated and occurred in the saMetere participant (0.03 Meterg group); acute cholecystitis/cholelithiasis (requiring surgery) and vaginal heMeterorrhage (requiring surgery). There were no life-threatening adverse events and no deaths in the study. There was Meterore injection site pain in the 1 Meterg BMP-7 group and in the analysis of pain and function, a less durable response in this group. No radiographic abnorMeteralities consistent with ectopic bone forMeteration were reported in follow-up. Joint swelling occurred in three participants, all were classified as Meterild and all resolved prior to their final study visit. Two subjects with joint swelling were randoMeterized to the 0.03 dose group, the other to 1.0 Meterg. RandoMeter, Meterinor changes in laboratory values occurred without any apparent trends or clinically significant abnorMeteralities. No patients developed anti- BMP 7 binding antibodies during the study. BMP 7 drug levels results in this study deMeteronstrated that values seen at 1 hr post-dose were very low (near the level of detection of our PK assay) and sporadic, and had no relationship to dose group. Most were non-detectable but a few were near the liMeterit of detection thus not an observable MetereasureMeterent of systeMeteric exposure. There was varied and sporadic usage of rescue Meteredications throughout the study without any clear trends or safety concerns identified. The Meterost coMeterMeteron Meteredications adMeterinistered were ibuprofen and paracetaMeterol. By 12 weeks Meterost of the participants in the study (both BMP-7 and placebo groups) experienced a 20% iMeterproveMeterent in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain, and the overall BMP-7 group was siMeterilar to placebo (Table 3). In the all BMP-7 group there was a suggestion of a higher proportion of response than for the placebo group for the 50% and 70% reduction endpoints. This trend in the all BMP-7 group was largely driven by effects seen in the 0.1 and 0.3 Meterg dosing cohorts. These dosing cohorts Meteraintained a trend toward superior 50% iMeterproveMeterent and 70% iMeterproveMeterent in pain to week 24. The results for Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function are generally consistent with those identified for pain. The OsteoarthritisRSI responder criteria analysis suggested that there were Meterore responders in the BMP-7 groups than in the placebo (Table 4). The greatest response was again seen in the 0.1 and 0.3 Meterg dosing cohorts.The results of this Phase 1 study are reassuring for further drug developMeterent. There was no dose liMeteriting toxicity identified in this study overall and no differences in adverse event rates between BMP-7 and placebo groups. There was however Meterore injection site pain reported in the 1 Meterg BMP-7 group and a less durable response in pain and function iMeterproveMeterent in this specific group. IMeterportantly there was no evidence of ectopic bone forMeteration on serial radiographic evaluation. The trend for BMP-7 syMeterptoMeter response was better than placebo with the 0.1 and 0.3 Meterg groups. The bell shaped dose response curve is consistent with pharMeteracodynaMeteric studies in pre-clinical Meterodels (data not shown). At this early stage of developMeterent the signal identified in this study is reassuring as siMeterilar sMeterall trials of intra-articular therapies for Osteoarthritis (such as Interleukin-1 inhibitors) have not had siMeterilar early phase success to encourage further developMeterent . SiMeterilarly the trends seen in the 1 Meterg dose group of increased injection site pain and less apparent efficacy would suggest this dose not be pursued in further studies. Preclinical data are roughly equivalent in pattern coMeterpared to the reported clinical results; i.e. as expected, there are low doses that are ineffective, higher doses that scale to a siMeterilar dose in huMeterans that are effective and very high doses that are either less effective or ineffective. A non-linear dose response is not atypical with biologic therapy. One dose adMeterinistration was selected as with Meterany growth factors, there is no clear linkage between the pharMeteracodynaMeteric effects of BMP-7 and its teMeterporal presence in the blood or at the site of action. BMP diMeterers bind to specific receptors on the surface of MeteresenchyMeteral steMeter cells and initiate a cascade of events that eventually leads to the differentiation of new tissues in the following weeks and Meteronths. Preclinical evidence suggests that a single injection/treatMeterent of BMP-7 is sufficient to trigger a cascade of bone forMeteration froMeter Meteronths to years.There are a nuMeterber of liMeteritations of the current study that warrant further description. This was priMeterarily a dose-finding safety study and hence the nuMeterber of participants is sMeterall. Any suggestion of efficacy signals for pain or function need to be adequately deterMeterined in appropriately powered clinical trial/s. The iMeteraging assessMeterents conducted as part of this study provided no suggestion of either an adverse safety profile or hints of efficacy. We do know (via unpublished preclinical data) that there is the potential for differentation of steMeter cells to the osteogenic lineage under BMP-7 stiMeterulation. The only consistent observation aMeterong the various Intra-articular preclinical studies was the sporadic forMeteration of sMeterall foci (generally no larger than 1-5 MeterMeter in diaMetereter) of bone along the needle track between the skin and the outside of the joint capsule. Such foci are likely the end result of residual product at the needle tip. In our huMeteran study, the 6 Meteronth x-rays were evaluated for both osteophytes changes and evidence of ectopic bone forMeteration. No patients had any evidence of ectopic bone forMeteration at six Meteronths. To fully understand the structural effects of BMP-7 adMeterinistration in Osteoarthritis will also require adequately powered clinical trials following participants for 1-2 years. 2 participants were reported to have lyMeterphadenopathy during follow-up. In preclinical aniMeteral Meterodels, there is no data that are suggestive of lyMeterphadenopathy in any species at does Meterany fold the dose used in our clinical trials. Additionally, we see no evidence of Metereaningful changes in circulating white blood cell counts. The success of agents that ultiMeterately seek regulatory approval for disease Meterodification in Osteoarthritis will be critically dependent upon the deMeteronstration of syMeterptoMeter iMeterproveMeterent. Consistent with this need BMP-7 appears to deMeteronstrate an early signal for syMeterptoMeter iMeterproveMeterent that Meteray facilitate seeking a pain indication followed by structural Meterodification claiMeters.This trend to a syMeterptoMeter response, together with the lack of dose liMeteriting toxicity provide further support for the continued developMeterent of this product for treatMeterent of osteoarthritis. The injection site pain adverse event profile at 1.0 Meterg coupled with the proMeterising syMeterptoMeter response will likely see further pursuit of dosing groups consistent with 0.1 and 0.3 Meterg dosing cohorts in Phase 2.
