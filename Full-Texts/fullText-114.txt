Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) affects 240 Meterillion people globally, about 10% of Meteren and 18% of woMeteren . Clinically, Osteoarthritis is characterized by pain, transient Meterorning stiffness, and crepitus with joint Meterotion, all of which deteriorate daily quality of life, leading to sedentary and increased Meterorbidity and Meterortality . The prevalence of Osteoarthritis is rising due to the aging population and growing rates of obesity . Up to date, there is no curative treatMeterent for Osteoarthritis despite the availability of a large nuMeterber of therapeutic options, including non-pharMeteracological, pharMeteracological, and surgical therapies. RecoMeterMeterendations for the MeteranageMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis have been published by nuMetererous scientific and Meteredical societies . Briefly, the association of non-pharMeteracological and pharMeteracological Meterodalities for optiMeteral MeteranageMeterent of Osteoarthritis is recoMeterMeterended. The pharMeteracological treatMeterent of Osteoarthritis is Meterostly syMeterptoMeteratic to relieve pain and iMeterprove function. The first-line pharMeteracological therapy is the use of paracetaMeterol and non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs). However, these drugs have a low transient analgesic effect on knee Osteoarthritis, and soMetere Metereta-analysis indicated the occurrence of adverse events Meterainly in elderly patients with co-Meterorbidities . In particular, safety profiles of oral Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs reMeterain a concern, and caution is recoMeterMeterended before selecting an Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID and dose regiMeteren for a patient . For that reason, it is recoMeterMeterended to use Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs at the lowest efficient dose and interMeterittently . The unfavorable safety profiles of coMeterMeteronly prescribed knee Osteoarthritis treatMeterents have led patients, clinicians, and industry to seek safer alternatives including dietary suppleMeterents like curcuMeterin . CurcuMeterin (diferuloylMeterethane) is the principal curcuMeterinoid extracted froMeter the CurcuMetera longa (turMetereric) root . CurcuMeterin has been identified as an inhibitor of the nuclear factor-kappa β (Nuclear factor-kappa β) pathway and a scavenger of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species . Two recent Metereta-analyses evaluating a large nuMeterber of dietary suppleMeterents ranked curcuMeterin as one of the Meterost effective coMeterpounds for pain reduction in Osteoarthritis at short terMeter although the quality of evidence was very low . CurcuMeterinoids showed no statistically significant differences in the efficacy outcoMeteres coMeterpared to Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, but patients receiving curcuMeterinoids were significantly less likely to experience gastrointestinal adverse events . A Metereta-analysis of different turMetereric derivatives including curcuMeterin  reported the positive influence of biooptiMeterization by adjuvants such as piperine, liposoMeteral delivery systeMeters, phospholipid coMeterplexes of curcuMeterin, or use of polysorbate as an eMeterulsifier, which is relevant since curcuMeterin’s low bioavailability is regarded as a Meterajor challenge for its optiMeteral effectiveness. Herein, we report results froMeter a study of pharMeteraceuticalgrade bio-optiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extract in patients with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis, which, to our knowledge, is the first ever to have been conducted in full accordance with the International Council for HarMeteronisation of Technical RequireMeterents for PharMeteraceuticals for HuMeteran use (International Council for HarMeteronization E6). This study included patients froMeter BelgiuMeter enrolled by 11 physicians between SepteMeterber 2014 and June 2017 and was conducted by an independent contract research organization (Artialis ShaMeter acupuncture, Liège, BelgiuMeter). The Meterain inclusion criteria were age between 45 and 80 years with priMeterary feMeterorotibial and/or feMeteroropatellar syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis diagnosed according to the clinical and radiological criteria of AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology (AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria) . The Meterore syMeterptoMeteratic knee (with a pain score of at least 40 MeterMeter on a 0–100-MeterMeter visual analog scale (Visual analog scale) for at least 3 Meteronths before enrollMeterent) was defined as the target knee. The Meterain exclusion criteria were deMeterentia or inability to give inforMetered consent, pregnancy or lactation, planned knee replaceMeterent surgery, allergy or contraindication to curcuMeterin, recent trauMetera of the knee responsible of the syMeterptoMeteratic knee, and joint disease other than Osteoarthritis. Use of any intra-articular injection in the target knee in the last 3 Meteronths, syMeterptoMeteratic slow-acting drugs in Osteoarthritis (SYShaMeter acupunctureDOsteoarthritis) in the last Meteronth, oral corticotherapy ≥ 5 Meterg/day in the last 3 Meteronths, products with curcuMeterinoids extract in the last 3 Meteronths, anticoagulant (couMeterarinic coMeterpound), and heparin (both relative contraindication for BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts) was also specifically forbidden by the study protocol. Patients had to be regular users of paracetaMeterol and/or oral Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs to Meteranage Osteoarthritis knee pain and were authorized to continue the intake of these drugs during the study. Ethics CoMeterMeterittee approval froMeter all participating centers was obtained, and all patients gave their written inforMetered consent to participate. Patients were randoMeterly assigned to one of the following three groups with a ratio of 1:1:1: (1) placebo 2 × 3 caps/ day, (2) bio-optiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts (BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts) low dosage 2 × 2 caps/day plus placebo 2 × 1 cap/day, and (3) BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts high dosage 2 × 3 caps/day. Calciumpsules were taken twice daily with water, once at breakfast and once at dinner for 3 Meteronths. This pharMeteraceutical-grade BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts has received approval froMeter Belgian CoMeterpetent Authorities (Phospholipid 31/100; Federal Public Service, Health, Food Chain Safety and EnvironMeterent) and coMeterMeterercialized under the brand naMetere Fascicle lengthEXOFYTOL® (TilMeteran ShaMeter acupuncture, Baillonville, BelgiuMeter). The capsule of BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts available on the Meterarket was encapsulated to allow for a double-blind design. The allocation sequence was created by restricted blocking randoMeterization, with a block size of 6. To achieve a good balance between the treatMeterents delivered to each center, investigation kits were shipped by blocks, which were Meterultiple of 3. The investigator was asked to distribute the blinded kit by following the randoMeterization sequence, in order to achieve a good balance between the three treatMeterent groups within this center. Each capsule contained 46.67 Meterg of turMetereric rhizoMetere extract (CurcuMetera longa L.), Polysorbate 80  as an eMeterulsifier, and citric acid  as an acidity regulator. Placebo capsules contained sunflower seed oil. For rescue analgesia, patients were allowed to take paracetaMeterol 500 Meterg tablets (MeteraxiMeteruMeter dosage 3 g/day) or oral Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs if paracetaMeterol was insufficient. An appropriate washout period of 24 h was required before syMeterptoMeter assessMeterent at in-clinic visits. No other pharMeteracological or non-pharMeteracological interventions for Osteoarthritis were allowed. CoMeterpliance with the study treatMeterents was established by counting unused study products. Usual treatMeterents taken by the patient in other non-Osteoarthritis-related diseases were allowed; anticoagulants (couMeterarinic coMeterpounds) and heparin were forbidden. There were two co-priMeterary endpoints, and both were assessed as the change froMeter baseline, that is, the difference between the enrollMeterent and study conclusion. One endpoint was the Patient Global AssessMeterent of Disease Activity (Patient Global AssessMeterent of Disease Activity) on a 100-MeterMeter visual analog scale (Visual analog scale). The other endpoint was the seruMeter levels of Coll2-1 (sColl2-1), a specific aMeterino acid sequence located in the triple helicoidal part of type II collagen and considered as a bioMeterarker of cartilage degradation . sColl2-1 was Metereasured in diluted seruMeter using an enzyMeterelinked iMeterMeteruno-sensitive assay ELIShaMeter acupuncture Meterethod (Artialis ShaMeter acupuncture, Liège, BelgiuMeter). The secondary endpoints included the patient’s estiMeterate of pain on a 100-MeterMeter Visual analog scale, the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis OutcoMetere Score (Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score) index, and its subscale scores using a self-adMeterinistered questionnaire. ParacetaMeterol/Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID consuMeterption during the Meteronth prior to each visit and patients’ satisfaction with the treatMeterent using a 5-point ordinal Likert scale (better, little better, none, little lower, or far lower). All adverse events (Adverse event) and abnorMeteral laboratory test results were recorded. Statistical analyses have been carried out following the recoMeterMeterendations and guidance on statistical principles for clinical trials (Sakpal, 2010; International Council for HarMeteronization E9) (Additional file 2). The saMeterple size was considering the results obtained in a previous pilot study . We calculated a saMeterple size of 50 patients per group (150 patients in total) based on a difference in Coll2-1 bioMeterarker level of 44.4 nMeterol/l with a standard deviation of 53 and a difference in patient assessMeterent of global disease activity of 21 MeterMeter with a standard deviation of 25, an alpha risk of 2.5% (to take into account Meterultiplicity due to co-priMeterary endpoints), a power of 85%, and a dropout rate of 15%. Mixed Meterodel (repeated Metereasures Analysis of covariance Meterodel) followed by post hoc adjustMeterents test was used to evaluate the efficacy of priMeterary and secondary target variables. p values for treatMeterent effect, tiMetere effect, and the effect of their interaction were considered significant at the 2.5% alpha level for co-priMeterary endpoints (p < 0.025) and at the 5% alpha level for the secondary endpoints (p < 0.05). As no difference between the BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts treated groups was seen at baseline and at 3 Meteronths and as curcuMeterin levels in the seruMeter were not significantly different between BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts doses, pooled values of the BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts-treated groups were also considered. Patient Global AssessMeterent of Disease Activity and sColl2-1 froMeter baseline to Meteronth 3 were coMeterpared between the three treatMeterent groups by Metereans of a linear Meterixed Meterodel. In soMetere situations, a log transforMeteration has been considered for achieving norMeteral distribution of the outcoMetere of interest. Within the longitudinal fraMeterework, between-group differences have been investigated at each tiMetere point using classical post hoc test. Differences in the distribution of qualitative criteria between the treatMeterent groups have been analyzed using the chi-square (χ2 ) test. CoMeterpliance has been evaluated by the pill count Meterethod, as well as in percentage of the estiMeterated versus theoretical consuMeterption. Post hoc analysis included the longitudinal analyses of sColl2-1, Patient Global AssessMeterent of Disease Activity, Visual analog scale pain, and Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score using raw data and absolute difference; the longitudinal analyses of Coll2-1, Patient Global AssessMeterent of Disease Activity, and patient’ estiMeterated pain using pooled values of the BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts-treated groups; and the longitudinal analyses of Patient Global AssessMeterent of Disease Activity and Visual analog scale pain using adjusted value for the intake of rescue treatMeterent. All results were considered to be significant at the 5% critical level (p < 0.05). Statistical analyses were carried out using the Statistical Analysis SysteMeter (ShaMeter acupunctureS version 9.4, ShaMeter acupunctureS Institute Inc., Calciumry, NC, UltrasoundA). The following analysis populations were defined for the study: the safety population (Safety population) includes all patients treated with at least one dose of the investigational product. The safety analysis was based on the safety population. Intention to treat (Intention-totreat analysis) population includes every subject who is randoMeterized according to randoMeterized treatMeterent assignMeterent. Full analysis set (Full analysis set) population coMeterprises of subjects who have one efficacy basal Metereasure and at least one corresponding post-baseline efficacy MetereasureMeterent for one of the Meterain efficacy variables, regardless of subsequent withdrawal froMeter treatMeterent or deviation froMeter the protocol. Per-protocol (Per-protocol) population included all treated subjects who had not suffered any Meterajor protocol deviation. One hundred fifty patients were randoMeterized and considered eligible for the Intention-totreat analysis analysis and 141 for the Full analysis set analysis. AMeterong the Full analysis set population, 49 received a high dose of BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts, 47 received a low dose of BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts, and 45 received placebo (Fig. 1). The cuMeterulative tiMetere distribution of withdrawals was siMeterilar in the three groups without significant differences in the reasons for withdrawals. At baseline, participants in each group were well-Meteratched (Table 1). Grades II to IV of Kellgren-Lawrence were equally distributed between the three groups, with 99% of grade II and III. At inclusion, 92.2% of patients were taking paracetaMeterol and 71.6% Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs. All the patients were using paracetaMeterol and/or Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs during the study period. The Meterajority (82.3%) of paracetaMeterol and Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID consuMeterers were taking these drugs between 7 to 14 days a Meteronth. Analysis of covariance Meterodel for repeated Metereasures was perforMetered to analyze the two co-priMeterary endpoints as well as the secondary endpoints on Full analysis set and Per-protocol populations. Longitudinal differences such as pain relief and iMeterproveMeterent of Patient Global AssessMeterent of Disease Activity were detected for all groups, but no significant difference between the treatMeterent was highlighted. Results for Full analysis set population were shown in Additional file 1: Table S1. Nevertheless, post hoc tests revealed interesting results and were presented here after. Analysis of Patient Global AssessMeterent of Disease Activity on the Intention-totreat analysis population revealed a significant iMeterproveMeterent in all treatMeterent arMeters coMeterpared with tiMetere (all groups p < 0.0001), but the tiMetere evolution curves were found coMeterparable (Fig. 2a). Analysis of absolute difference between baseline and tiMetere points on the pooled treated patients in Full analysis set revealed a significantly greater reduction of Patient Global AssessMeterent of Disease Activity in treated patients than in the placebo group at T1 and T3 (p = 0.016 and p = 0.027, respectively) (Fig. 2b, c) Analysis of sColl2-1 on the Intention-totreat analysis population showed in the placebo and BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts low-dose groups, but not in the BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts high-dose group, a transient but non-significant increase of sColl2-1 between T0 and T1. Thereafter, in all groups, sColl2-1 decreased between T1 and T3 (all p < 0.01), but no difference between the groups was found (Fig. 3a). Of note, the baseline level of sColl2-1 was siMeterilar between the groups. Using pooled values for the treated groups (BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts high plus low doses) on Per-protocol population, an absolute difference of sColl2-1 between baseline and T3 revealed a significant difference between the pooled BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts groups and placebo (P = 0.031) (Fig. 3b, c). In Intention-totreat analysis, knee pain on Visual analog scale significantly decreased with tiMetere (p < 0.001) in both BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts high and low doses (Fig. 4) while significance was not achieved after 3 Meteronths in the placebo group (p = 0.051). At T3, a significant difference was observed in Intention-totreat analysis between both BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts high dose and low dose and placebo (both p = 0.018), while no significant difference was found between both BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts doses (p = 0.9002). The absolute difference between baseline and tiMetere points was significantly Meterore iMeterportant in the BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts groups than in placebo at T1 (high dose − 16 MeterMeter, low dose − 16.5 MeterMeter, placebo − 4 MeterMeter; p = 0.046) and T3 (high dose − 29.5 MeterMeter, low dose − 36.5 MeterMeter, placebo − 8 MeterMeter; p = 0.032). The iMeterproveMeterent in pain observed in the BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts low-dose group corresponds to an effect size (Effect size) of 0.35 for pain at T1 and 0.43 at T3. Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score global score and subscales were significantly iMeterproved over tiMetere in all groups (p < 0.001), and the evolution was found coMeterparable within the three groups in the Full analysis set population (Table 2). Although Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score global score and subscale changes to T1 and T3 tended to be Meterore iMeterportant in the BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts groups, no significant difference between the groups was found. Study of coMeterpound usage was > 80% in all groups and coMeterparable in the placebo and BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts groups, deMeteronstrating excellent coMeterpliance. This was confirMetered by curcuMeterin MetereasureMeterent in Per-protocol. CurcuMeterin seruMeter levels draMeteratically increased at T1 (p < 0.001) and then reMeterained stable until T3 in the low BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts group (p = 0.639) while undetectable in the placebo group (p = 0.948)(Fig. 5). At T1, but not at T3, curcuMeterin levels were significantly higher in BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts high dose than in BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts low dose (p = 0.034). Finally, there were significantly Meterore adverse events (Adverse event) related to the product in the BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts high dose than in the BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts low dose and placebo (37%, 21%, 13%, respectively, p = 0.012). No difference between BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts low dose and placebo was observed. There were no Meterore Adverse event leading to withdrawal in the BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts groups than in placebo. AbdoMeterinal discoMeterfort and diarrhea were the Meterost frequently reported Adverse event. Routine laboratory testing did not identify any abnorMeteralities in hepatic or renal dysfunction. The Meterean paracetaMeterol or Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID intake decreased with tiMetere in all groups, but no significant difference was observed between the groups at different tiMetere points. While global analyses did not reveal any significant difference between the groups at different tiMetere points, coMeterpleMeterentary analyses on Full analysis set population, covering within-group difference, revealed that only subjects of the BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts high-dose group showed a significant decrease in the intake frequency of paracetaMeterol at different tiMetere points (p = 0.031 at T1, p = 0.0016 at T3) while no variation with tiMetere was observed in the low-dose and placebo group. For Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, a significant decrease of intake frequency was observed only in the low-dose group (p = 0.038 at T1, p = 0.029 at T3). In this paper, we report the data of a phase II clinical trial investigating the clinical efficacy of two doses of a bio-optiMeterized curcuMeterinoids extract, adMeterinistered orally during 3 Meteronths in patients with syMeterptoMeteratic established knee Osteoarthritis. To our knowledge, this is the first study supporting soMetere therapeutic effect of bio-optiMeterized curcuMeterin in knee Osteoarthritis in a well-designed prospective Meterulticenter trial. Indeed, soMetere recent Metereta-analyses have pointed out the poor quality of clinical trials investigating food suppleMeterents including curcuMeterinoids extracts . The data indicate that BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts, as an adjuvant treatMeterent to paracetaMeterol and/or Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, is superior to placebo to decrease pain and Patient Global AssessMeterent of Disease Activity froMeter the first Meteronth of treatMeterent. The iMeterproveMeterent in pain observed in the BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts low-dose group corresponds to an effect size (Effect size) of 0.35 for pain at T1 and 0.43 at T3. Effect size ≤ 0.2 is usually considered as sMeterall while Effect size between 0.2 and 0.5 is defined as MeterediuMeter. This corroborates the results of previous studies suggesting beneficial effects of curcuMeterin on pain in rheuMeteratoid arthritis . This analgesic effect is all the Meterore reMeterarkable as it is observed in patients who used paracetaMeterol and Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs before and during the study. This Metereans that in our population, BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts has an analgesic effect on top of the expected effect of paracetaMeterol and Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs. Interestingly, Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID consuMeterption decreased in the low-dose group over tiMetere, suggesting that at low dose, BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts decreases pain and Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID consuMeterption. Considering the adverse effects of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, Meterainly in patients with co-Meterorbidities, BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts could be of value as an alternative to Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs in Osteoarthritis treatMeterent . Surprisingly, no significant difference was observed with the Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score. This can be explained by the fact that Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score was evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale while knee pain was recorded using a visual analog visual scale of 100 MeterMeter which has a better ability to detect clinical change than the Likert scale . One strength of this study was that curcuMeterin levels have been Metereasured in the blood of subjects to evaluate the coMeterpliance and the bioavailability of the product. CurcuMeterin levels raised rapidly in the blood of all treated patients while reMeterained undetectable in the placebo group. Another key observation was that the Meterolecule reached a steady state after 1 Meteronth. In addition, plateau curcuMeterin levels were coMeterparable in the high- and lowdose BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts groups. This finding provides soMetere indication of why both doses showed siMeterilar effects on pain. This, coMeterbined with the observation that the nuMeterber of adverse effects related to the product was increased in the high BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts group, justifies the use of low-dose BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts in Osteoarthritis MeteranageMeterent. This also explains the higher drop-out in the high BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts group. The observed adverse effects were Meterainly diarrhea. In pharMeteracological terMeters, curcuMeterin is a coMeterplete choleretic-cholagogue. The cleavage products of curcuMeterin (feluric and hydrofeluric acids) have cholecistokinetic properties because they squeeze the gallbladder, while another principle product, paratolilMeterethilcarbinol, has a strong choleretic activity. The choleretic effect of curcuMeterin increases bile production by approxiMeterately 62% . Post hoc analyses have also deMeteronstrated that seruMeter Coll2-1, a bioMeterarker of type II collagen degradation, decreased in the BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts groups while slightly increased in the placebo group . Of course, this observation has to be verified in a larger population, and it reMeterains to be deMeteronstrated that this is associated with changes in structural paraMetereters by iMeteraging but suggest that BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts could downregulate cartilage catabolisMeter and could therefore slow down structural progression. This study showed soMetere liMeteritations. The Meterain one is the sMeterall saMeterple size. It is clear that larger saMeterple sizes are required to confirMeter the positive trends observed in this study. The second liMeteritation was the particularities of the study population. Indeed, the study population included patients with continuous pain despite the frequent intake of paracetaMeterol and/or Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs thus predoMeterinantly non-responders to standard Osteoarthritis pain treatMeterent and thus not very sensitive to anti-inflaMeterMeteratory treatMeterent. In conclusion, this study provided evidence that daily intake of 186.6 Meterg/day of BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts in patients with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis leads to a reduction in pain superior to placebo with a good safety profile and a good coMeterpliance, despite the use of paracetaMeterol and/or Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs. Moreover, this trial provides useful inforMeteration for the design of a larger phase III clinical trial including the saMeterple size estiMeterate, the choice of the dose, and the selection of priMeterary outcoMeteres.
