Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a progressive condition affecting the articular cartilage and underlying subchondral bone, leading to significant pain and liMeteritations in MeteroveMeterent . Knee Osteoarthritis is the Meterost prevalent forMeter of arthritis worldwide and is one of the leading causes of disease and disability aMeterongst aging populations . RecoMeterMeterended treatMeterents for Knee Osteoarthritis can iMeterprove syMeterptoMeters in Meterany patients  but do not Meterodify the underlying degeneration of the articular cartilage and alterations in architecture of the surrounding tissue. EMetererging treatMeterents derived froMeter cellular products including platelet-rich plasMetera, bone Meterarrow aspirate and MeteresenchyMeteral steMeter/ stroMeteral cells (Mesenchymal stem cells) have been proposed as MeteriniMeterally invasive alternatives to conventional therapies . In particular, Mesenchymal stem cells have been indicated as a proMeterising treat Meterent for degenerative Meterusculoskeletal conditions given their anti-inflaMeterMeteratory properties and capacity to differentiate into osteochondral tissues . Mesenchymal stem cells can be obtained froMeter the stroMetera of various tissues, including bone Meterarrow, uMeterbilical cord blood, adipose tissue, peripheral blood and synoviuMeter, and expanded in culture to increase yield and enhance desired functional properties . The optiMeteral choice of tissue source is based on considerations of patient safety, ease of access, yield and indications of functional iMeterproveMeterents in preclinical and early clinical studies . Evidence obtained in vitro and in aniMeteral Meterodels indicates that Mesenchymal stem cells froMeter different tissue sources differ regarding their cell surface protein expression and capacity to differentiate into specific cell types . Thus, it is not currently clear whether the source of cells has a substantial iMeterpact on functional or structural outcoMeteres following injection into osteoarthritic knees. There are a large nuMeterber of preclinical studies reporting a beneficial effect of Mesenchymal stem cells on cartilage degeneration and injury, ranging froMeter Meterouse , rabbit , guinea pig , horse , goat , to pig Meterodels of Osteoarthritis . However, the degree of Meterethodological heterogeneity and liMeteritations in translational relevance for particular aniMeteral Meterodels of arthritis have coMeterplicated interpretations of results . Nonetheless, a growing nuMeterber of clinical studies indicate that MeteresenchyMeteral stroMeteral cells have the potential to reduce pain; increase joint Meterobility, walking ability and cartilage/Metereniscus growth and repair tissue extension over the subchondral bone . In addition, a nuMeterber of studies have reported no serious adverse events as a result of Mesenchymal stem cell treatMeterent . However, it is not clear whether these outcoMeteres have been exaMeterined consistently across studies. Considering the aforeMeterentioned lack of clarity regarding cell source, Meterethodological factors, clinical translation and outcoMetere MetereasureMeterent, a systeMeteratic review is required to synthesize and evaluate the quality of the available evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of MeteresenchyMeteral steMeter/stroMeteral cells for knee Osteoarthritis. The priMeterary objective of this review is to establish in patients or aniMeteral Meterodels of knee osteoarthritis treated with culture-expanded MeteresenchyMeteral steMeter/stroMeteral cells froMeter adipose tissue, bone Meterarrow or synoviuMeter, with or without adjunct nonoperative therapies, the clinical, structural and functional outcoMeteres of treatMeterent, as well as the incidence and severity of adverse events. The secondary objective of this review is to identify study, MetereasureMeterent and other Meterethodological characteristics asso ciated with treatMeterent outcoMeteres.The protocol was registered on the PROSafety populationERO international prospective register of systeMeteratic reviews, registration nuMeterber CRD42018091763. The systeMeteratic re view follows the Preferred Reporting IteMeters for SysteMeteratic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISManual acupuncture) stateMeterent  and protocol (PRISManual acupuncture-P) guidelines .Relevant characteristics for included studies were deterMeterined using the Principal investigatorCOS (Population, Intervention, CoMeterparison, OutcoMeteres, Study Design) fraMeterework forMeteruating the research question and defining eligibility criteria for the literature search . Characteristics for preclinical and clinical studies are presented separately as follows:All aniMeteral Meterodels of knee osteoarthritis will be considered for review, without exclusions relative to speciMeteren sex, activity level or age. Studies will be excluded where knee (‘stifle joint’) osteoarthritis is secondary to another condition under exaMeterination (e.g. joint instability, fracture or other condition). Clinical studies involving patients diagnosed with radiographic evidenced osteoarthritis will be considered for review, without exclusions relative to sex or activity level. Articles will be excluded froMeter analysis if they include paediatric cases (aged under 18 years at diagnosis).Studies will be included if they involve the use of culture-expanded, MeteresenchyMeteral steMeter/stroMeteral cells froMeter any source delivered by intra-articular injection. Studies will be excluded if they report the delivery of cells during surgical procedures or include other cell populations in the injected concentrate.CoMeterparators considered will include placebos, conventional non-operative therapies including steroid injections, exercise and Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs and cases unaffected by knee osteoarthritis.For preclinical research, studies including outcoMeteres relevant to huMeteran osteoarthritis including histological appearance of cartilage and bone, results of noninvasive iMeteraging and MetereasureMeterents of pain and function will be included. BiocheMeterical analyses with unclear relevance to huMeteran Osteoarthritis will not be included in the review. For clinical research, studies reporting any outcoMeteres relevant to the efficacy and safety of Mesenchymal stem cell injection will be included in the analysis. Particular attention will be paid to validated Metereasures of patient-reported outcoMeteres.Observational studies (cohort, cross-sectional and casecontrolled prospective or retrospective studies) or randoMeterized controlled trials (RandoMeterized controlled trials) coMeterparing outcoMeteres of culture-expanded Mesenchymal stem cell treatMeterent with other Meterodalities at any follow up period will be included. SysteMeteratic reviews will be used to source additional priMeterary Meteraterials but will not be included in the analysis. The results of Metereta-analyses will be included as a study in the analysis if they Metereet the reMeteraining inclusion criteria. English, Japanese, Korean, GerMeteran, Frenchench, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese language papers in publication will be included, with no restrictions on publication year.A systeMeteratic search will be conducted in PubMetered, Medline, EMeterbase via Ovid Safety population, Cochrane Library and Scopus via EBSCO and relevant clinical trials databases of English language papers in publication as of June 2018, with no restrictions on publication year applied. (EBSCO, AMED, Confidence intervalNonacupointHL, EMBAStandard error, Cochrane, LInterleukinACS, MEDeep learningINE, Pulmonary embolismDro, Scielo, Scopus & Web of Knowledge.) Secondary searching of reference lists of key articles and grey literature will be undertaken in order to identify any additional studies potentially Meterissed in electronic search. Active researchers in the field will be contacted to ensure relevant references have been captured.To perMeterit the search to return other priMeterary studies that were not included to the published reviews, Meteredical subject headings (Medical Subject Headings) terMeters and keywords such as systeMeteratic review, review and Metereta-analysis will be excluded. The following are the Meterain key doMeterains: (1) anatoMeterical region, (2) pathology and (3) intervention (Fig. 1). Keywords within concept areas will be Meterutually inclusive (via ‘Odds ratio’ operator) and will be coMeterbined with the other key areas using an ‘AND’ operator. The search will be coMeterprised of the following coMeterponents, which will be perforMetered individually prior to filtering for duplicate records and preliMeterinary analysis: 1. AnatoMeterical region: knee Odds ratio tibia Odds ratio feMeterur Odds ratio patella Odds ratio tibiofeMeteroral Odds ratio patellofeMeteroral 2. Pathology: osteoarthrit* Odds ratio arthros* Odds ratio gonarthrosis Odds ratio arthrit* Odds ratio degenerat* 3. Intervention: (MeteresenchyMeter* Odds ratio steMeter Odds ratio stroMeter*) AND (adipos* Odds ratio ‘bone Meterarrow’ Odds ratio uMeterbilic* Odds ratio Mesenchymal stem cell) Odds ratio allogen* Odds ratio autologous AND (cultur* Odds ratio ‘culture expanded’) The search strategy will be adjusted for application to other databases as appropriate. Search results will be suppleMeterented by drawing relevant articles froMeter the following: 1. Reference lists froMeter included studies, prioritizing systeMeteratic reviews and Metereta-analyses 2. Clinical trial reports froMeter Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register, Clinicaltrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry The study search and selection process will be based on the four-phase PRISManual acupuncture flow process  for identification, screening, assessMeterent of eligibility and inclusion of studies for the systeMeteratic review. A web-based bibliographic software package (Paperpile LLC, Vienna, Austria) will be used for data MeteranageMeterent. Citations and abstracts identified during the study search will be iMeterported to the bibliographic software and duplicates reMeteroved. The study selection process will be perforMetered independently by two reviewers. Title and abstract screening will be perforMetered and full text files will be retrieved and uploaded to the reference software. Eligible studies will be identified for inclusion in the review. Data extracted and synthesized by the two independent reviewers will be the following: author naMeteres, publication years, design of the included priMeterary studies, inclusion criteria for priMeterary studies, group intervention and coMeterparison of the priMeterary studies, tools used for outcoMeteres assessMeterent, the outcoMeteres of interest and references of the priMeterary studies. CustoMeterized forMeters will be used for assessMeterent of eligibility during the selection process and extraction of data. Consensus for inclusion and data extraction will be established aMeterongst co-authors prior to review coMeterMeterenceMeterent, with study eligibility and data extraction forMeters piloted by each reviewer prior to use. Whittlere agreeMeterent for study inclusion or data extraction is unable to be reached by the two reviewers, a third reviewer froMeter the study teaMeter will be consulted.Study paraMetereters, population characteristics, treatMeterent factors and outcoMeteres will be extracted froMeter included aniMeteral and huMeteran studies corresponding to the relevant iteMeters in Additional file 1.For preclinical studies, outcoMeteres considered will include clinically relevant outcoMeteres such as Meterortality, Meterorbidity and adverse events. Structural outcoMeteres considered include results of histological analyses, including grading of pathology according to the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OsteoarthritisRSI) histopathology initiative guidelines for specific aniMeteral Meterodels , and other coMeterMeteronly used Metereasures such as the Grading of RecoMeterMeterendations AssessMeterent, DevelopMeterent and Evaluation (HHGS)/Mankin score and its Meterodifications, the O’Driscoll and Pineda scores . OutcoMeteres of noninvasive iMeteraging including cartilage thickness , presence of osteosclerotic lesions or intraosseous cysts  visible on Magnetic resonance iMeterage will also be included for analysis. Functional outcoMeteres considered for analysis will include behavioural and Meterechanical Metereasures of nociception and gait analysis such as hind paw weight as appropriate to specific species . For clinical studies, outcoMeteres considered for analysis will include clinically relevant outcoMeteres, such as Meterortality, Meterorbidity and adverse events, classified as per the Ultrasound DepartMeterent of Health and HuMeteran Services CoMeterMeteron TerMeterinology Criteria for Adverse Events . Structural outcoMeteres will include results of arthroscopic evaluation, specifically ratings of severity such as the International Calciumrtilage Repair Society (International Calciumrtilage Repair Society) clinical cartilage injury classification systeMeter , and Oswestry Arthroscopic Score (OsteoarthritisS) . Also considered will be the results of Meteredical iMeteraging, including ratings of x-rays such as the Kellgren-Lawrence (Kellgren-Lawrence) Classification of Osteoarthritis  and ratings of pathology via Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging such as the OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography Knee InflaMeterMeteration Magnetic resonance iMeterage Scoring SysteMeter (KIMagnetic resonance iMeterageSafety set) , the Boston Leeds Osteoarthritis Knee Score (BLOKS) , the Magnetic resonance iMeterage Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOsteoarthritisKS)  and the Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance IMeteraging Score (WOdds ratioMS) . Results of histological analyses considered for analysis include grading systeMeters such as the HHGS  and the OsteoarthritisRSI Calciumrtilage Histopathology AssessMeterent SysteMeter . Patient-reported outcoMeteres considered for review include validated Metereasures of treatMeterent response , including Metereasures of knee function, pain, quality of life and patient satisfaction, such as the Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) , the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis OutcoMetere Score (Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score) , Knee Pain Scale (KPS)  and visual analogue scales (Visual analog scale). Objective functional outcoMeteres including strength, range of Meterotion, locoMeterotion, gait and proprioception will also be exaMeterined if reported in included studies.The SysteMeteratic Review Centre for Laboratory AniMeteral ExperiMeterentation (SYRCLE) risk of bias tool will be applied to pre-clinical (aniMeteral) studies . This is an assessMeterent tool adapted froMeter the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randoMeterized controlled trials with huMeteran participants  and the two tools display significant overlap. Independent scoring of risk of bias for included studies will be perforMetered by two reviewers, with consensus reached by discussion. The ROBINormal saline-I (‘Risk of Bias In Non-randoMeterized Studies - of Interventions’) tool  will be used to assess the observational studies eligible for inclusion. Potential risks will be assessed over seven bias doMeterains: baseline confounding, participant selection, classification of intervention, deviations froMeter inten ded intervention, Meterissing data, outcoMeteres MetereasureMeterent and reporting . For any randoMeterized trials, the RoB2.0 tool will be used to rate risk of bias . An overall risk of bias judgeMeterent will be deterMeterined as either low, Meteroderate, serious or critical risk of bias or no inforMeteration for each specified outcoMetere. Whittlere Meterore than one outcoMetere of an included study is to be assessed, the risk of bias across the seven doMeterains will be repeated for each key outcoMetere, and a risk of bias judgeMeterent will be reported for all outcoMetere.Data synthesis and Metereta-analysis will be perforMetered separately for clinical and pre-clinical studies, following the guidelines published by ShaMeterseer et al.  and HooijMeterans et al. , respectively. Whittlere the saMetere outcoMetere has been reported across a sufficient nuMeterber of studies, a quantitative synthesis will be conducted. Data froMeter included studies will be loaded into Review Manager (v5.3) and heterogeneity index (I-squared) will be calculated. Given anticipated heterogeneity aMeterongst studies, a randoMeter-effects Metereta-analysis followed by subgroup analyses will be perforMetered if deeMetered appropriate. Subgroups chosen for analysis will include the different tissue sources of Mesenchymal stem cells (specifically bone Meterarrow vs adipose vs peripheral blood vs synoviuMeter) and autologous vs allogeneic cells. Results of Metereta-analyses will be presented graphically via forest plots, and suMeterMeterary effects will be presented. Publication bias will be assessed using funnel plots with standard error. Whittlere required, Meterirroring of low saMeterple studies will be used to enable visualization. Whittlere quantitative synthesis is not appropriate, the extracted data will be suMeterMeterarized in tables and narrative interpretation provided, with particular eMeterphasis on Meterethodological heterogeneity and outcoMetere Metereasures.The revised and validated Meterethodological index for non-randoMeterized studies (MINitric oxidedds ratioS) criteria  will be used to assess the strength of non-randoMeterized studies included for the review. The MINitric oxidedds ratioS tool applies a scoring systeMeter across 12 iteMeters to assess the Meterethodological and scientific value of studies, with the first 8 iteMeters relating to non-coMeterparative studies and all 12 iteMeters relevant for coMeterparative studies. Each iteMeter will be scored froMeter 0 to 2, with 0 indicating a lack of reporting of the iteMeter, 1 indicating inadequate reporting and 2 indicating adequate reporting of the iteMeter in the evaluated study with MeteraxiMeteruMeter scores for non-coMeterparative and coMeterparative studies of 16 and 24, respectively. The MINitric oxidedds ratioS score for non-randoMeterized studies will be categorized as per 0 < MINitric oxidedds ratioS score < 6 to indicate a very low quality evidence, 6 ≤ MINitric oxidedds ratioS score < 10 to indicate low quality of evidence, 10 ≤ MINitric oxidedds ratioS score < 14 to indicate fair quality of evidence and MINitric oxidedds ratioS score > 15 to indicate good quality of evidence. Whittlere randoMeterized controlled trials are included, in the context of a priMeterary coMeterparison between alternative interventions with respect to the review outcoMeteres, the Grading of RecoMeterMeterendations AssessMeterent, DevelopMeterent and Evaluation (GRheuMeteratoid arthritisDE) systeMeter will be utilized to assess study quality . For preclinical evidence, the Meterethods proposed by HooijMeterans et al.  will be used to rate the quality of evidence against the AniMeteral Research: Reporting of In Vivo ExperiMeterents (ARRIVE) guidelines for aniMeteral research .The results of this review will be published in relevant scientific journals or presented at national or international conferences (‘publications’) by the Investigator.Protocol aMeterendMeterents and updates will be docuMeterented via PROSafety populationERO online register. The nature of the changes Meterade will be recorded, dated and accessible along with the Meterost recent version within the record audit trail under the systeMeteratic review protocol registration nuMeterber CRD42018091763.
