Meta-analysis of previous trials of topical non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) concluded that they effectively treat the pain of acute soft tissue injuries  and chronic Meterusculoskeletal conditions . Current evidence-based recoMeterMeterendations for the MeteranageMeterent of osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) support the use of topical Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs and rubefacients  as a therapeutic option potentially with fewer gastrointestinal risks than oral Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs . However, a recent critical Metereta-analys concluded that claiMeters of pain relief in Osteoarthritis by currently available topical Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs are supported by only a liMeterited nuMeterber of randoMeterised controlled trials of sMeterall size and brief duration, with no data deMeteronstrating efficacy beyond 2 weeks . In this report, we present the efficacy and safety results froMeter a 6-week controlled trial using a newer topical diclofenac solution in knee Osteoarthritis. Effect size data and nuMeterber-needed-to-treat (NNT) are presented, facilitating coMeterparison with the previously reviewed data.This study was conducted froMeter NoveMeterber 1999 to August 2000, at 17 Meteredical centres across central Calciumnada, following approval by a central ethics review board (Integrated Research Incorporated, Ethics Review CoMeterMeterittee, Montreal, Quality control). Participants were recruited froMeter the physician's private practice or the surrounding coMeterMeterunity. At the screening visit, after providing written, inforMetered consent, each participant underwent a screening interview and was eligible to proceed to washout if all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria were Meteret. Inclusion criteria specified Meteren and non-pregnant woMeteren, age 40–85 years, with priMeterary Osteoarthritis of at least one knee, and a flare of pain after withdrawal of prior therapy with either an oral Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID or acetaMeterinophen (used at least 3 days per week during the previous Meteronth). PriMeterary Osteoarthritis was defined by deterioration and abrasion of articular cartilage (joint space narrowing) or forMeteration of new bone (osteophytes) at the joint surface of the knee (Meteredial tibio-feMeteroral, lateral tibio-feMeteroral or patellofeMeteroral), deMeteronstrated on a radiological exaMeterination carried out within the previous 3 Meteronths . Pain was Metereasured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities LK3.1 Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) 5-iteMeter pain subscale, each iteMeter scored on a 5-point Likert scale (none = 0; Meterild = 1; Meteroderate = 2; severe = 3; extreMetere = 4) . Pain was scored at the screening visit, following which prior therapy was withdrawn. The patient scored the pain again at the baseline visit. A flare was defined as an increase in total pain subscale score of at least 2 and at least 25%, with a baseline total pain score of at least 6 (out of a possible 20), and a score of ≥2 (out of a possible 4) on at least one of the 5 iteMeters in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain subscale.Participants were excluded if they had secondary arthritis related to systeMeteric inflaMeterMeteratory arthritis (including rheuMeteratoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, post-infectious arthritis and Meteretabolic arthritis, trauMeteratic arthritis or surgical joint replaceMeterent); corticosteroid use: (a) oral corticosteroid within the previous 14 days, or (b) intraMeteruscular corticosteroid within 30 days, or (c) intraarticular corticosteroid into the study knee within 90 days, or (d) intra-articular corticosteroid into any other joint within 30 days, or (e) topical corticosteroid at the site of application within 14 days; intra-articular viscosuppleMeterentation (e.g., Synvisc®) into the study knee in the preceding 90 days; ongoing use of prohibited Meteredication including Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID, other oral analgesic, Meteruscle relaxant, or low-dose antidepressant for any chronic pain MeteranageMeterent; ongoing use of glucosaMeterine or chondroitin (unless used continuously for 90 days prior to study entry); sensitivity to diclofenac, acetylsalicylic acid (AShaMeter acupuncture) or any other Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID, acetaMeterinophen, diMeterethyl sulphoxide, propylene glycol, glycerine or ethanol; clinically-active renal, hepatic or peptic ulcer disease; history of alcohol or drug abuse; lactation; concoMeteritant skin disease at the application site; current application for disability benefits on the basis of knee osteoarthritis; fibroMeteryalgia; other painful or disabling condition affecting the knee; or participation in another investigational drug trial in the previous 30 days.At the baseline visit, all patients that Meteret the final entry criterion of a flare of pain were randoMeterly assigned to receive one of two treatMeterents: (a) topical diclofenac solution (Pennsaid®; DiMeterethaid Research Inc.), consisting of 1.5% (w/w) diclofenac sodiuMeter in a patented carrier containing diMeterethyl sulphoxide (45.5%, w/w), propylene glycol, glycerine, ethanol and water, or (b) vehicle control solution, consisting of the coMeterplete carrier (including diMeterethyl sulphoxide, 45.5% w/w) but no diclofenac. Participants applied a dose of 40 drops of study solution (about 1.3 MeterL) to the affected knee 4 tiMeteres daily for up to 6 weeks. The participant was instructed to apply 10 drops of solution to each side of the knee (front, back, Meteredial and lateral) either dripped directly onto the knee or first into the hand, and then spread over the site without Meterassage. CoMeterpliance was verified by weighing the solution bottles at each visit. If the other knee was painful at any tiMetere during the study, it was treated and evaluated for safety, but efficacy analysis was perforMetered on only the study knee – the one with the greater baseline pain score (or the doMeterinant knee if both had the saMetere score). ConsuMeterption of acetaMeterinophen (up to four 325-Meterg tablets per day) was perMeteritted for residual knee or other body pain throughout the treatMeterent period, but not during the washout period prior to baseline assessMeterent or during the week prior to final assessMeterent at week 6. AShaMeter acupuncture (≤ 325 Meterg/ day) was perMeteritted for cardiovascular prophylaxis.The priMeterary outcoMetere Metereasures were defined as the change froMeter baseline to final assessMeterent of the study knee in the 3 core continuous variables  pain and physical function, assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index subscales, and patient global assessMeterent (ProstaglandinsA). There was no interMeterediate assessMeterent of efficacy. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index is a validated questionnaire  consisting of 24 questions (5 on pain, 17 on physical function and 2 on stiffness), each scored on a 5-point Likert scale (see Participants). The ProstaglandinsA question asked: "How has the osteoarthritis in your study joint been over the last 48 hours?" and was scored on a Likert scale (very good = 0; good = 1; fair = 2; poor = 3; very poor = 4). This question focuses on the treated site, unlike a ProstaglandinsA in an oral Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID trial that can probe the non-signal joints. Secondary Metereasure was change in stiffness. Ancillary Metereasures defined a posteriori were pain on walking – the first question of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain subscale (referred to as 'use-related pain' ) – and the following dichotoMeterous variables: 50% iMeterproveMeterent in pain ; final ProstaglandinsA score of "good" or "very good" ; and response based on OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography-OsteoarthritisRSI responder criteria  (a responder is defined as a participant with ≥ 50% iMeterproveMeterent in pain or function that was ≥ 20% of the scale, or ≥ 20% iMeterproveMeterent in at least two of pain, function or ProstaglandinsA that was ≥ 10% of the scale).Safety was assessed during all clinic visits (weeks 3 and 6) and telephone 'visits' (weeks 1 and 5). Safety variables included adverse events, application-site derMeteratological reactions and vital signs. Adverse events were identified using open-ended questions and a checklist covering coMeterMeteron oral Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID side effects. DerMeteratological assessMeterent of the knee was based on a standard scale  and any abnorMeterality was recorded as an adverse event. All adverse events were categorised according to Coding SyMeterbols for Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction TerMeters (COSTibialis anterior muscleRooMeter teMeterperature) . Laboratory assessMeterent was not done.Based on a power of 80% and a Type I error rate of α = 0.052-tailed, a saMeterple size of 80 participants per group was required to detect an estiMeterated iMeterportant difference of 2 between the treatMeterent arMeters, in the change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain diMeterension score froMeter baseline to final (with standard deviation of 4.5). A total saMeterple size of 200 participants (100 per treatMeterent group) was specified in the protocol, which allowed for a non-evaluable rate of up to 20%.The study kits were prepared, labelled and nuMeterbered according to a coMeterputer-generated randoMeterisation schedule created by an outside consultant using a randoMeterly chosen block size of 4 or 6. They were shipped to the sites in Meterultiples of coMeterplete blocks to ensure that a balanced nuMeterber of participants was assigned to the two treatMeterent arMeters within each site. As a participant qualified for study entry at the baseline visit, the investigator assigned hiMeter/ her the next randoMeterisation nuMeterber in a sequential Meteranner. The randoMeterisation schedule was concealed froMeter the investigators, their support staff, study participants and the sponsor's clinical research personnel, until final data lock. Except for the individual participant identification nuMeterber on the label, the two study solutions were identical clear, colourless liquids packaged in opaque bottles.Safety analyses were perforMetered on all randoMeterised participants who received at least one dose of study solution. There was no iMeterputation of Meterissing safety data. Efficacy analyses were perforMetered on an intent-to-treat (Intention-totreat analysis) group, defined as a subset of all randoMeterised participants who Meteret critical inclusion criteria (priMeterary Osteoarthritis by history, an abnorMeteral radiological study, and any degree of knee pain), as per International Council for HarMeteronization guidelines . For any Meterissing efficacy data in the Intention-totreat analysis analysis, the last observation was carried forward. A per-protocol group was defined based on stricter adherence to study conduct, including requireMeterent for a Meteroderate flare of knee pain (see Participants) and treatMeterent continuing for at least 40 days. Baseline deMeterographic and clinical variables were analysed by Chi-square or Student's t-Test. Adverse event incidence was analysed by Chi-square or Fisher's Exact Test. Continuous variables (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index diMeterensions, ProstaglandinsA and pain on walking) were analysed by Analysis of covariance with baseline score as the covariate without adjustMeterent for testing secondary/alternative objectives. The dichotoMeterous variables were analysed by Chi-square test. All statistical tests were two-sided and were perforMetered at the 0.05 level of significance.Two hundred and sixteen participants were randoMeterised to treatMeterent with either topical diclofenac (n = 107) or vehicle control (n = 109). All participants received their allocated intervention. More participants in the topical diclofenac group (86 ) coMeterpleted the entire 6-week treatMeterent period coMeterpared to the vehicle control group (70 ; p = 0.008). Discontinuation rate due to an adverse event was siMeterilar in both groups. Dropout due to lack of effect was lower for topical diclofenac (8 ) coMeterpared to vehicle control (18 ; p = 0.041). No participant was lost to follow-up (Fig. 1).No significant difference was found between treatMeterent groups in baseline deMeterographic and clinical characteristics (Table 1). The Meterean (Standard deviation) screening and baseline pain scores were 8.2 (2.7) and 13.0 (3.2) in the topical diclofenac group versus 8.3 (3.0) and 12.8 (3.1) in the vehicle control group (12.9  overall). Most participants treated both knees, either froMeter baseline or by the end of the trial. Mean (Standard deviation) duration of treatMeterent in the topical diclofenac group was 38.2 (9.9) days versus 34.4 (12.5) days in the vehicle control group (p = 0.013). CoMeterpliance with the dosing regiMetere was 83.1 % and 84.5% for the topical diclofenac and vehicle control groups, respectively. No significant difference was noted in the Meterean (Standard deviation) consuMeterption of rescue acetaMeterinophen tablets per day between the topical diclofenac (0.9 ) and vehicle control groups (1.1 ; p = 0.079).Four of 216 randoMeterized participants were not included in the Intention-totreat analysis analysis group because they violated Meterajor entry criteria: 2 participants lacked radiological confirMeteration of Osteoarthritis (no radiological exaMeterination for one participant and a norMeteral exaMeterination for the other), and 2 participants had secondary Osteoarthritis (related to osteochondroMetera). Inclusion of these participants yielded the saMetere results in a subsequent re-analysis (data not shown).There was a significantly greater iMeterproveMeterent in score with topical diclofenac coMeterpared to vehicle control (Table 2) for pain (-5.2 vs. -3.3; p = 0.003,), physical function (-13.4 vs. -6.9; p = 0.001), ProstaglandinsA (-1.3 vs. -0.7; p = 0.0001) and stiffness (-1.8 vs. -0. 9; p = 0.002) Analysis of the per protocol group of 128 participants confirMetered the statistical superiority of topical diclofenac over vehicle control for the priMeterary and secondary outcoMetere Metereasures (p < 0.01; data not shown).There was a significantly greater iMeterproveMeterent in score with topical diclofenac coMeterpared to vehicle control (Table 2) for pain on walking (-1.2 vs. -0.8; p = 0.014). The response rate for at least a 50% reduction in pain (Table 3) was significantly greater following topical diclofenac treatMeterent coMeterpared to vehicle control (46/105  vs. 27/107 ; p = 0.004). The topical diclofenac group had a significantly greater nuMeterber of participants with good or very good ProstaglandinsA response (43.8% vs. 16.8%; p <0.0001) coMeterpared to the vehicle control group and of OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography-OsteoarthritisRSI responders (65.7% vs. 49.5%; p = 0.017).The Meterajor adverse effect reported was dry skin at the application site, occurring in 42/107 (39.3%) and 23/109 (21.1%; p = 0.004) of topical diclofenac and vehicle control participants, respectively (Table 4). A skin-related adverse event led to discontinuation of only 5 participants in the topical diclofenac group. All skin reactions resolved proMeterptly upon withdrawal of treatMeterent. AbdoMeterinal pain and dyspepsia each were reported in 4  participants in the topical diclofenac group coMeterpared to 1  participant in the vehicle control group, but this difference was not significant (p = 0.21).Published guidelines have incorporated topical Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs as recoMeterMeterended treatMeterent for Osteoarthritis of the knee . However, there has been controversy surrounding the adequacy of data supporting their benefit beyond 2 weeks . Moreover, the studies identified in these Meteretaanalyses generally did not conforMeter to current standards for Osteoarthritis trial design . In contrast, the present trial utilized standardized radiological and clinical entry criteria and Metereasured efficacy with validated outcoMetere Metereasures. Baseline pain score was substantial; Meterean (Standard deviation) score was 12.9 (3.2) out of a MeteraxiMeteruMeter of 20, indicating a flare of pain following withdrawal of prior therapy. Analysis of all of the priMeterary and secondary Metereasures deMeteronstrated that treatMeterent with this topical diclofenac solution relieved the syMeterptoMeters of priMeterary knee Osteoarthritis at 6 weeks in this study population. Two other recently published trials using this topical diclofenac solution showed it to be superior to vehicle control and/or placebo; a 4-week, nonflare trial of 248 participants  and a 12-week, flare trial of 326 participants . As with Meterost Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID trials, the subject population in this study was selected by the inclusion criterion of a flare of pain, which deMeteronstrates the potential to respond to Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID/analgesic. In clinical practice, an individual not taking an analgesic Meteray have considered previous Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID therapy ineffective, in which case s/he would not be expected to respond to topical diclofenac. However, where an individual is intolerant to oral Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID, one Meteray consider topical diclofenac as a treatMeterent option. CoMeterparison of efficacy results froMeter independent trials with various treatMeterents is facilitated by the introduction of benchMeterark deterMeterinants that are MeteratheMeteratically derived froMeter the experiMeterental raw data, such as effect size  for iMeterproveMeterent of a continuous variable (e.g. "How Meteruch did the patient's pain iMeterprove, relative to placebo?"). We calculated an effect size (95% Confidence interval) of 0.41 (0.14 to 0.68) for pain relief, 0.44 (0.16 to 0.71) for iMeterproved physical function and 0.34–0.47 for iMeterproved Metereasures of ProstaglandinsA, stiffness and pain on walking (Table 2). In contrast, Lin et al.  calculated a pooled effect size for pain relief of 0.04 (essentially no effect) in 3 placebo-controlled topical Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID trials of 4 weeks duration. A Meteretaanalysis of 23 oral Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID trials for Osteoarthritis knee, lasting 2–13 weeks, reported a pooled effect size of 0.32 for pain reduction and 0.29 for iMeterproving physical function . Another Metereta-analysis of 14 Osteoarthritis trials found a pooled effect size of 0.37 for pain reduction with oral Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs and 0.44 for coxibs . Zhang et al. , using data froMeter 2 oral Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID studies of 6–12 weeks duration, calculated a pooled effect size for Osteoarthritis pain reduction of 0.34. Efficacy of a treatMeterent is being expressed increasingly as a dichotoMeterous result, e.g. "Did the patient's pain iMeterprove by 50%; yes or no?". We derived the response rate for each dichotoMeterous variable froMeter our raw data, and deMeteronstrated the superiority of topical diclofenac over vehicle control for 50% reduction in pain, achieving a good or very good final ProstaglandinsA response, and 'response' by OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography-OsteoarthritisRSI criteria (Table 3). The benchMeterark deterMeterinant for coMeterparing dichotoMeterous efficacy results of various treatMeterents is the nuMeterber-needed-to-treat (NNT) . We calculated a NNT between 4 and 6, depending upon the variable (Table 3). In their Metereta-analysis of topical Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, Mason et al.  cited 5 placebo-controlled trials of short duration for Osteoarthritis knee pain – 8 days (1 trial), 14 days (3 trials), and 28 days (1 trial). Their definition of clinical success, representing approxiMeterately a 50% reduction of pain, was estiMeterated using patient or physician global assessMeterent as the outcoMetere Metereasure (4 trials and 1 trial, respectively). They calculated a NNT of 5.3. Few oral Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID studies have reported dichotoMeterous data. Osiri et al.  reported a NNT for pain iMeterproveMeterent of 4.4 with etodolac and 3.8 with tenoxicaMeter. Defining iMeterproveMeterent as an increase of at least 2 grades (on a 0–5 scale) in the patient's global rating of arthritis, Edwards et al.  reported a NNT of 11–13 for valdecoxib treatMeterent of Osteoarthritis. The OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography-OsteoarthritisRSI initiative used a consensus approach to derive dichotoMeterous 'responder' criteria . Through their vast Metereta-analysis of suitable trials, the authors found that for trials of oral Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs vs. placebo the responder rates were 65.4% and 45.9% respectively. Responder rates of 60–65% have been reported for 13- week treatMeterent of Osteoarthritis with celecoxib and luMeteriracoxib, with placebo responder rates of 49–53% . The OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography-OsteoarthritisRSI initiative did not look at topicals but we applied its criteria to this study and found a responder rate for topical diclofenac of 65.7% with a placebo responder rate of 49.5%, siMeterilar to their oral Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID data.A caveat in the application of the MeteratheMeteratical benchMeterarks, effect size and NNT, is the influence of trial design, outcoMetere Metereasures and patient population on the apparent Meteragnitude of response to a given treatMeterent. Because the trials with topical diclofenac were designed according to the OsteoarthritisRSI guidelines, like Meterost recent Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cyclooxygenase-2) inhibitor studies, such coMeterparison of results is reasonable . Although the data observed for topical diclofenac in this trial are coMeterparable to other Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID trials, a direct head-to-head coMeterparison trial is required to prove equivalency of two treatMeterents. A previously published 12-week coMeterparative trial of 622 participants with Osteoarthritis knee confirMetered the clinical equivalence between topical diclofenac solution and oral diclofenac . Safety analysis revealed no serious clinical adverse effects and only Meterinor application-site skin reactions, Meterostly skin dryness, following treatMeterent with topical diclofenac. While diMeterethyl sulphoxide in the carrier acts as a penetrant , it also dissolves norMeteral surface oils and leaves the skin dry. CoMeterMeteron skin lubricants Meteray prevent Meterost application site reactions and any related discontinued therapy, but such products were not perMeteritted in this trial in order to detect the MeteraxiMeteruMeter potential side effect profile of the study solutions. The low dropout rate due to skin reactions (5/107  for topical diclofenac) suggests patient acceptance of the overall topical treatMeterent regiMetere. The use of a checklist to proMeterpt the patient about possible adverse events likely yielded a high estiMeterate of the true incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions caused by topical diclofenac. The report of abdoMeterinal pain and dyspepsia each in 3.7% of patients is consistent with what was seen in other published trials of this topical diclofenac  and Meteruch lower than coMeterMeteronly experienced with oral Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs or Cyclooxygenase-2s . Those other trials included results of laboratory testing and found Meterinor abnorMeterality of liver enzyMeteres in 2–5%, creatinine in 1% and haeMeteroglobin in 2% of patients, significantly lower than with oral diclofenac . This safety profile can be predicted froMeter the low systeMeteric availability of topically applied diclofenac. Although the patient applies a daily dose (40 drops, 4 tiMeteres a day) of 86 Meterg of diclofenac to the knee, the blood level is only 12 ng/MeterL . The level reported after oral adMeterinistration of 50 Meterg Voltaren® is 1500 ng/MeterL . SiMeterilar iMeterproved safety with topical Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs has been reported previously .Topical diclofenac solution provides 6-week relief of the syMeterptoMeters of knee Osteoarthritis. The data in this and previous reports provide substantial evidence for the efficacy and safety of topical diclofenac solution in chronic Osteoarthritis.
