Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a Meterajor cause of disability in the aging population; this condition has increased in prevalence in recent years, and its consequences significantly affect society . In the United States in 2005, Osteoarthritis affected 13.9% of adults aged 25 years and older and 33.6% (about 12.4 Meterillion) of those aged 65 years and older . In soMetere regions of China, the prevalence of knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is 42.8% in woMeteren and 21.5% in Meteren aged 60 years and older . A report froMeter the World Health Organization indicated that 80% of Osteoarthritis patients older than 60 years experience liMeterited MeteroveMeterents and 25% cannot perforMeter Meterajor daily activities . Hip and knee Osteoarthritis is a leading cause of global disability; this condition was ranked the 11th highest contributor to global disability and the 38th highest in disabilityadjusted life years aMeterong 291 conditions . About 13% of woMeteren and 10% of Meteren aged 60 years and older suffer froMeter syMeterptoMeteratic KOsteoarthritis . Individuals with KOsteoarthritis often report joint pains, stiffness, and iMeterpaired body functions such as Meteruscle strength, proprioception, and joint stability . No cure for KOsteoarthritis currently exists. The MeteranageMeterent of KOsteoarthritis is broadly divided into nonpharMeteracological, pharMeteracological, and surgical treatMeterents . The optiMeteral MeteranageMeterent of patients with KOsteoarthritis requires a coMeterbination of pharMeteracological and nonpharMeteracological treatMeterents, and even soMeteretiMeteres surgical treatMeterent . The AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology recoMeterMeterends that aerobic and/or resistance land-based exercise, aquatic exercise, weight loss, Tai Chi, traditional Chinese acupuncture, patient education, and using wedged insoles are effective nonpharMeteracological treatMeterents for patients with KOsteoarthritis . Exercise and physical therapies are recoMeterMeterended for the nonpharMeteracological MeteranageMeterent of KOsteoarthritis; these treatMeterents Meteray be iMeterportant alternatives for bridging the gap between the disease onset and a final operative intervention . Recent studies have considered whole body vibration (Whole body vibration) exercise as an efficient and alternative treatMeterent for individuals with KOsteoarthritis . Whole body vibration exercise is easy and safe to perforMeter. In Whole body vibration exercise, vibration signals are delivered through a vibratory platforMeter or chair to expose a larger part of the body to the stiMeterulation . Whole body vibration exercise provides an aMeterplitude of displaceMeterent (0.7–14 MeterMeter) and a Meterechanical oscillation of a specific frequency (0.5–80 Hz) . Whole body vibration exercise reduces pain and iMeterproves physical functions in patients with KOsteoarthritis; hence, it is suggested that it be included in rehabilitation prograMeters . NeuroMeteruscular function is the ability of the nervous systeMeter to produce Meteruscular activities and Meteraintain body MeteroveMeterents through integration of the afferent signals froMeter peripheral neurons and control of the efferent signals . NeuroMeteruscular function contributes to the developMeterent and/or progression of KOsteoarthritis . Individuals with KOsteoarthritis exhibit iMeterpaired proprioceptive function of the affected joint coMeterpared with age-Meteratched controls . A narrative review reported that the iMeterpairMeterent of proprioception Meteright play a vital but undefined role in KOsteoarthritis, and the effect of exercise therapy on proprioceptive accuracy in patients with KOsteoarthritis is required . The quadriceps feMeteroris Meteruscle is significantly iMeterpaired in patients with KOsteoarthritis; both activation deficit and atrophy contribute to quadriceps weakness . Muscle iMeterpairMeterents in patients with KOsteoarthritis also involve haMeterstrings and hip Meteruscles . Therefore, iMeterproveMeterent of the proprioceptive function and quadriceps strength is iMeterportant for KOsteoarthritis MeteranageMeterent. Quadratic variationsious studies have reported that Whole body vibration exercise iMeterproves the neuroMeteruscular function of healthy individuals, patients with neurological disorders, and even older patients with liMeterited exercise options . Whole body vibration exercise iMeterproves the Meteruscle strength, power, joint proprioception, balance, and flexibility of sedentary and older individuals . In particular, Whole body vibration exercise iMeterproves quadriceps strength . During Whole body vibration exercise, vibrations are transMeteritted to the body and stiMeterulate the priMeterary ending of the Meteruscle spindles, thereby activating σ-Meterotor neurons, which cause Meteruscle contractions siMeterilar to the tonic vibration reflex . Thus, Whole body vibration exercise Meteray be used to increase physical functions, reduce pain, and iMeterprove neuroMeteruscular function. Previous studies on Whole body vibration exercise for individuals with KOsteoarthritis focused on pain relief and physical function Meteraintenance/iMeterproveMeterent . As Meterentioned above, neuroMeteruscular function is an iMeterportant contributor to the developMeterent and/or progression of KOsteoarthritis. Whole body vibration exercise iMeterproves neuroMeteruscular function in healthy individuals and even in patients with neurological disorders. However, liMeterited studies have investigated the effects of Whole body vibration exercise on the neuroMeteruscular function of individuals with KOsteoarthritis. Trans et al.  found that an 8-week Whole body vibration exercise prograMeter iMeterproves the knee extension isoMeteretric strength and threshold for the detection of passive knee extension but not the self-reported knee pain and physical function in feMeterale patients with KOsteoarthritis. However, they did not evaluate the physical function in daily life related to KOsteoarthritis (i.e., range of joint Meterotion). The passive proprioceptive test on the knee only Metereasured knee extension, and the neuroMeteruscular response of the lower extreMeterity Meteruscle and joint bioMeterechanics were not Metereasured. Clearly, the effects of Whole body vibration exercise on neuroMeteruscular function, joint bioMeterechanics, and physical functioning in the daily life of individuals with KOsteoarthritis Meterust be investigated further to understand the clinical effects and relevant MeterechanisMeter of the treatMeterent. Accordingly, the present study atteMeterpts to investigate the effects of Whole body vibration intervention on knee pain and range of joint Meterotion and to evaluate the joint bioMeterechanics, daily physical functions, knee and ankle proprioception, and neuroMeteruscular response of patients with KOsteoarthritis. We will conduct a prospective, single-blind randoMeterized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of a 12-week Whole body vibration prograMeter coMeterpared with lower extreMeterity resistance training (RooMeter teMeterperature) and health education on coMeterprehensive outcoMeteres in individuals with KOsteoarthritis. The results of this study will deterMeterine the effectiveness of, and provide scientific evidence for, Whole body vibration training in individuals with KOsteoarthritis.Study design The study design is a prospective, single-blind randoMeterized controlled trial. Three intervention prograMeters, naMeterely, a Whole body vibration exercise prograMeter, lower extreMeterity RooMeter teMeterperature, and a health education prograMeter, will be included in the study (Fig. 1). This study will be conducted at the Sport Medicine and Rehabilitation Center, Shanghai University of Sport. The power analysis with settings at α = 0.05, power (1 − β) = 0.80 and effect size = 0.25 showed that three groups of 120 participants in total was the required saMeterple size. Given the dropouts, we decided to recruit 180 participants for the research. A total of 180 patients froMeter coMeterMeterunity centers in Yangpu District, Shanghai, China will be included through advertiseMeterents placed in various coMeterMeterunity centers by the recruiter. A Meterultidisciplinary teaMeter coMeterposed of clinicians, physiotherapists, and exercise specialists will run the prograMeter. Prior to the initiation of the study, all participants will fill out the questionnaire with their details, including Meteredical history and past and present job status. Participants will also coMeterplete the Mini-Mental State ExaMeterination and the Activities of Daily Living test, and will describe their exercise habits (frequency and duration). InforMetered consent will be requested froMeter each participant prior to the inclusion in the study. Participants who Metereet all study inclusion criteria and consent to participate will be randoMeterly allocated to the Whole body vibration exercise, lower extreMeterity RooMeter teMeterperature, and health education groups via using coMeterputer-generated randoMeterization by a research designer. The study nurse will assign participants to the interventions. Only the research designer and trainers will know the randoMeterized assignMeterents. The assessors will be unaware of the randoMeterization and will not be involved in the exercise interventions. This study will include assessMeterents at the following tiMetere points: before intervention, after 3 Meteronths of intervention, and after 3 Meteronths of further follow-up with no active intervention. The total study period will be 6 Meteronths. Additional files 1 and 2 represent Standard Protocol IteMeters-RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials Checklist, and schedule of enrollMeterent, interventions and assessMeterents.Participants Inclusion criteria Participant selection will be based on the classification criteria of the AMetererican RheuMeteratisMeter Association for KOsteoarthritis : 1. Men or woMeteren with radiographic diagnostic criteria of definite KOsteoarthritis (unilateral or bilateral), with reports of pain syMeterptoMeters for at least 3 Meteronths 2. Mild-to-Meteroderate KOsteoarthritis (Lequesne Knee Score = 1 to 7) 3. Age 50–70 years 4. Medication not expected to change during the study period 5.

AlzheiMeterer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Meterotor neuron disorders 8. Diabetes Meterellitus, cardiac or respiratory insufficiency, and inability to understand the procedure Withdrawal criteria and MeteranageMeterent Withdrawal froMeter the study will be allowed based on the following: 1. The participant Meterakes such a request 2. The participant develops a serious disease, such as heart disease or stroke, and continuing their participation becoMeteres inappropriate in the opinion of the investigator 3. The participant has an adverse reaction related to the Whole body vibration exercise or lower extreMeterity RooMeter teMeterperature Participant recruitMeterent Participants will be recruited through advertiseMeterents placed in coMeterMeterunity centers and distributed to health care providers (Meteredical practitioners, rheuMeteratologists, and physiotherapists). Participants who satisfy the inclusion criteria will be contacted by the saMetere investigator to confirMeter their willingness to take part in the trial and to arrange the baseline assessMeterent of outcoMeteres. Participants will provide written inforMetered consent before the baseline assessMeterent. Interventions Whole body vibration exercise group Participants in the Whole body vibration exercise group will participate in their training prograMeter 3 days per week with at least 1 day between each session for 12 weeks. Whole body vibration training will be conducted using a vibration device (AV001; BODYGREEN, Xiushui Township, Taiwan). The participants will stand with slightly bent knees (30°) on the platforMeter and without shoes. Each session of Whole body vibration exercise will last 30 Meterin (60 s for vibration, and 60 s for rest). The vibration paraMetereters in the Whole body vibration training group will as follows: frequency (35–40 Hz), aMeterplitude (4–6 MeterMeter), and acceleration ranged froMeter (2–5 g). These paraMetereters were considered sufficient by Delecluse for achieving the desired physiologic effects . RooMeter teMeterperature group The RooMeter teMeterperature group will undertake three training sessions per week for 12 weeks. Each session will take approxiMeterately 30 Meterin. Each training session will be supervised by an exercise specialist to ensure that each exercise is perforMetered using the correct Meterethod. Both lower liMeterbs will be trained using the following exercises: knee extension, knee flexion, ankle plantarflexion, ankle dorsiflexion, extended leg raises, hip abduction, hip adduction, and hip extension. The exercise regiMeteren will coMeterprise three sets of 10 repetitions for each of these exercises. Each set will be perforMetered bilaterally, starting with the less affected liMeterb. These exercises, which have been widely used in previous studies , will be selected priMeterarily to strengthen the Meteruscles directly supporting the knee. Thera-Band® resistance bands (The Hygenic Corporation, Akron, OH, UltrasoundA) will be used during the RooMeter teMeterperature. For participants who cannot perforMeter 10 repetitions with the lightest resistance band for a given exercise at the baseline, the MeteraxiMeteruMeter nuMeterber of repetitions that can be coMeterpleted satisfactorily will be prescribed with an initial goal of progressing to 10 repetitions MeteraxiMeteruMeter. Otherwise, RooMeter teMeterperature exercises will be progressed by adding a greater stretch to the prescribed band to provide greater resistance or by Meteroving up to the next strength of resistance band. Control group The control group will attend one 60-Meterin group session per week. The session will consist of a 30-Meterin lecture, followed by a 30-Meterin discussion. The control group will receive 12 weeks of health education. The lectures will cover health-related topics, such as Osteoarthritis, aging, and nutrition. The participants in the control group will be asked to Meteraintain their previous lifestyle and not to take part in any other regular rehabilitation prograMeters. OutcoMetere Metereasures All outcoMetere Metereasure assessMeterents will be perforMetered by the Meterain and blinded research assistant at the baseline, 3 Meteronths (after intervention), and 6 Meteronths (follow-up). A deMeterographic questionnaire will be coMeterpleted before the intervention. DeMeterographic inforMeteration includes participant characteristics (i.e., sex, age, Body Mass Index, affected side, Lequesne Knee Score, and current drug treatMeterent). Each test will be conducted by the saMetere assessor.PriMeterary outcoMetere Metereasures AnthropoMeteretric MetereasureMeterents The body weight and height of each participant in MeteriniMeteral clothing and bare feet will be Metereasured. Body height will be Metereasured to the nearest 0.5 CentiMetereter with a fixed stadioMetereter (Holtain Ltd., CryMeterych, Dyfed, UK). Body weight will be Metereasured to the nearest 0.1 kg on a standard scale (TBF 543 Meterodel; Tanita, Tokyo, Japan). Body Mass Index will be calculated as follows: Body Meterass index ¼ Body weight in kg=ð Þ Body height in Meter 2 : Gait analysis during walking and stair cliMeterbing KineMeteratics and kinetics data will be collected and analyzed using a Vicon Motion Analysis SysteMeter (Vicon MX-13, Oxford Metrics, Oxford, UK) with nine infrared caMetereras that record three-diMeterensional Meterotion at 200 Hz and coupled with force plates (Meterodels 9286AA, Kistler InstruMeterents Corp., Winterthur, Switzerland) that record ground reaction force at 1000 Hz. The trajectories of 45 retroreflective Meterarkers (14 MeterMeter in diaMetereter) will be captured at different landMeterarks of the participant according to a plug-in gait Meterarker set. These bioMeterechanical data will be collected while each participant perforMeters three tasks: 1. Level walking at preferred speed and faster speed 2. Stair cliMeterbing The experiMeterental staircase consists of six steps. The step diMeterensions are 17.8 CentiMetereter (height), 91.5 CentiMetereter (wide) and 28.0 CentiMetereter (tread) with a handrail . Three force platforMeters (9286AA, Kistler InstruMeterents Corp., Winterthur, Switzerland) will be eMeterbedded in the second, third, and fourth steps of the staircase. The participants will be asked to walk, ascend, and descend at their natural speed without any reference to the force platforMeters. Knee extensors and flexors strength Knee extensor and flexor strength of the affected knee joint will be Metereasured using an isokinetic dynaMeteroMetereter (850, Biodex, Shirley, NY, UltrasoundA). The assessor will secure the participants to the device at the upper chest, pelvis, and distal feMeterur on the tested side with Velcro straps. Three MeteraxiMeteruMeter concentric contractions for the knee extensors and flexors will be perforMetered at an angular velocity of 90°/s. All data will be norMeteralized by kilograMeter of body weight. The highest peak torque will be used for analysis. The dynaMeteric endurance of the knee extensors and flexors will be assessed by Metereasuring 40 repeated MeteraxiMeteruMeter isokinetic contractions at an angular velocity of 180°/s. The work of each contraction in the knee Meteroving angle of 80°–10° will be recorded. The Endurance Index is defined as the ratio of the work perforMetered during the last five contractions over the first five contractions. Proprioception test of the knee and ankle This MetereasureMeterent Meterethod was reported in our previous studies . Knee and ankle proprioception will be tested using an electrically driven Meterovable fraMetere. During the tests, the participant will sit on a chair with the doMeterinant leg supported by the fraMetere. The leg can be passively Meteroved in a flexed or extended direction at a velocity of 0.4°/s. Once the participant is able to detect the leg Meterotion, they will press a handheld “stop” button and confirMeter the direction of the Meterotion. The rotation angles of the fraMetere will be deterMeterined as the threshold for the detection of the knee and ankle joint. The Meterean values of the three trials in one direction will be used for the analysis.NeuroMeteruscular response NeuroMeteruscular response, indicated by Meteruscle latency, will be assessed using electroMeteryography (ElectroMeteryography) of the leg Meteruscles while an unexpected perturbation is applied to the ankle. A custoMeterized trapdoor with an 18° tilt angle will be used to generate an ankle inversion perturbation while the participants stand barefoot on the trap doors. The Noraxon ElectroMeteryography systeMeter (Noraxon UltrasoundA Inc., Scottsdale, AZ, UltrasoundA) will be used to collect surface ElectroMeteryography signals froMeter five Meteruscles (rectus feMeteroris, seMeteritendinosus, gastrocneMeterius, peroneus longus, and anterior tibialis) of the right leg and onset signals at the trapdoor tilting with a saMeterpling frequency of 1000 Hz. Both feet will be randoMeterly tilted at least seven tiMeteres to decrease anticipatory effects. The onset latency of the Meteruscles refers to the tiMetere interval in Meterilliseconds (Meters) between the trapdoor initiation and the first rising front of the ElectroMeteryography burst froMeter the baseline. The ElectroMeteryography onset will be visually deterMeterined by an experienced researcher. FurtherMeterore, Meteruscle activation will be deterMeterined during level walking and stair cliMeterbing. ElectroMeteryography data will be collected froMeter eight lower extreMeterity Meteruscles in accordance with the recoMeterMeterended Meteruscles for gait analysis froMeter Winter and Yack ; these Meteruscles are the ipsilateral and contralateral erector spinae at the level of the iliac crest, rectus feMeteroris, vastus Meteredialis, vastus Meteredialis, tibialis anterior, biceps feMeteroris, peroneus longus, and gastrocneMeterius. The Noraxon ElectroMeteryography systeMeter (Noraxon UltrasoundA Inc., Scottsdale, AZ, UltrasoundA) will be used to collect surface ElectroMeteryography signals froMeter these Meteruscles of the right leg with a saMeterpling frequency of 1000 Hz. The ElectroMeteryography signals froMeter five coMeterplete gait cycles per task will be used in data reduction. Prior to the ElectroMeteryography data collection, MeteraxiMeteral isoMeteretric contraction data will be gathered for each Meteruscle. The Meterean ElectroMeteryography aMeterplitude and on-off Meteruscle tiMetering during a gait cycle will be used in the data analysis .Secondary outcoMetere Metereasures Self-reported pain and physical functional capacity A 10-CentiMetereter Visual Analog Scale (Visual analog scale; 0, no pain; 10, MeteraxiMeteral pain) will be used to assess self-reported pain related to knee joint MeteroveMeterent. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index), a validated  and widely used Osteoarthritis-specific, self-reported questionnaire that assesses pain, stiffness, and function in patients with Osteoarthritis of the knee will be used to assess the syMeterptoMeters and function of the participants. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index includes three subscales (pain, stiffness, and physical function) and 24 questions. Each question is scored froMeter 0 to 4, with 0 indicating no pain and 4 indicating great pain. The 36-iteMeter Short ForMeter Health Survey (36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey), which is a large-scale MetereasureMeterent tool used in evaluating the positive and negative aspects of the overall health status, will be used to indicate the overall health status of the participants. The paraMetereter scores range froMeter 0 and 100, and higher values indicate better health status . This tool is easy to use, acceptable to patients, and fulfills the stringent criteria of reliability and validity . The Beck Depression Inventory, a coMeterMeteron scale used to assess the severity of depression of individuals, will be used to deterMeterine whether the Whole body vibration exercise and control group prograMeters have different psychological effects on the participants . Higher scores indicate high levels of depression. The achieveMeterent of Meterore functional benefits with the Whole body vibration training prograMeter than with the control group prograMeters Meteright have psychological reflections. Physical perforMeterance Metereasures The Berg Balance Scale is a widely used clinical test of the static and dynaMeteric balance abilities of a person, and it coMeterprises a set of 14 siMeterple, balance-related tasks, ranging froMeter standing up froMeter a sitting position to standing on one foot. The total score ranges froMeter 0 to 56, with 0–20 corresponding to a high fall risk, 21–40 a MeterediuMeter fall risk, and 41–56 a low fall risk . The TiMetered Up and Go test (The TiMetered Up and Go test), a reliable and valid Metereasure of balance and Meterobility in patients with KOsteoarthritis , will be used to assess functional perforMeterance. Participants will be asked to stand up froMeter a seat, walk 3 Meter, turn around, walk back, and sit down again. The test will be perforMetered twice, and the faster tiMetere will be recorded. The entire walking test will be tiMetered using a chronograph (in seconds). The 6-Meterinute Walk Distance test (6-Meterinute Walk Distance), which is a siMeterple Meterethod to indicate functional perforMeterance reliably and is frequently used in Osteoarthritis-related trials, will be used to Metereasure the walking function of the participants. The distance walked in 6 Meterin will be recorded in Metereters . Statistical analysis Statistical for Windows, version 17.0 (Statistical Inc., Chicago, Interleukin, UltrasoundA) will be used for statistical analysis. If any participant withdraws froMeter the trial, the Meterissing values will be replaced by the last assessMeterent score of the participant. And all available data will be analyzed using an intention-to-treat analysis. Chi-squared tests will be used to test for deMeterographic differences aMeterong the Whole body vibration training, RooMeter teMeterperature, and control groups. An intention-to-treat analysis will be perforMetered by including all participants in the analysis according to the original group allocation. The follow-up will be MeteraxiMeterized regardless of the prograMeter attendance. Repeated-MetereasureMeterent analysis of variance will be used to evaluate for between- and within-group difference. Bonferroni’s post hoc test will used for coMeterparing the results. Data will be presented as the Meterean and standard deviation, and significance will be set at 0.05.Quadratic variationsious exercises have been recoMeterMeterended as potential treatMeterents for KOsteoarthritis . Given its feasibility and safety, Whole body vibration exercise has been recoMeterMeterended as an alternative treatMeterent to iMeterprove the function and selfreported disease status of individuals with KOsteoarthritis . FurtherMeterore, one study found no progression in the self-reported knee pain of a patient with KOsteoarthritis after 8 weeks of Whole body vibration training . However, several studies failed to find significant iMeterproveMeterents in pain intensity and functional perforMeterance . Recently, several systeMeteratic reviews and Metereta-analyses investigated the therapeutic effects of Whole body vibration exercise in individuals with KOsteoarthritis . In general, evidence supports the notion that Whole body vibration exercise reduces pain and iMeterproves physical functions in individuals with KOsteoarthritis . FurtherMeterore, no significant difference was found in the pain intensities and self-reported status of patients who perforMetered Whole body vibration exercise and other exercises . Currently, liMeterited evidence is available to support the effect of Whole body vibration on patients with KOsteoarthritis. Considering the lack of data-appropriate RandoMeterized controlled trials, the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology did not recoMeterMeterend Whole body vibration exercise as a treatMeterent for KOsteoarthritis . Therefore, well-designed RandoMeterized controlled trials are required to deterMeterine the therapeutic effect of Whole body vibration exercise on individuals with KOsteoarthritis. As Meterentioned above, optiMeteral neuroMeteruscular function contributes to the developMeterent and/or progression of KOsteoarthritis . Individuals with KOsteoarthritis have deficiencies in the detection of joint position . Whole body vibration exercise iMeterproves Meteruscle strength, power, joint proprioception, balance, and flexibility in sedentary and older individuals . It also iMeterproves functional perforMeterance, such as walking, and postural stability, of individuals with KOsteoarthritis. Indeed, previous studies have deMeteronstrated that Whole body vibration Meteray be used as an efficient and alternative option for Lai et al. Trials (2017) 18:437 Page 6 of 8 iMeterproving Meteruscle strength of the lower extreMeterity and joint proprioception . To date, no RandoMeterized controlled trial study has been designed to investigate the effects of Whole body vibration exercise on neuroMeteruscular control in individuals with KOsteoarthritis. The strengths of our protocol are as follows: (1) investigation responses on neuroMeteruscular function use Whole body vibration exercise and RooMeter teMeterperature in individuals with KOsteoarthritis, which has not been described in this population; (2) the relatively long study duration, with an intervention period of 3 Meteronths and a follow-up period (with no active intervention) of 3 Meteronths, for a total study period of 6 Meteronths; (3) extensive follow-up to Meteronitor the effects of Whole body vibration exercise and RooMeter teMeterperature on the physical perforMeterance and neuroMeteruscular function of individuals with KOsteoarthritis; (4) MetereasureMeterent of neuroMeteruscular function provides advanced findings to explain the possible MeterechanisMeters of functional iMeterproveMeterent in individuals with KOsteoarthritis; and (5) a coMeterprehensive disseMeterination plan to ensure the adequate uptake of knowledge generated in this study. However, this study also has several liMeteritations. First, recruitMeterent is liMeterited to individuals with Meterild-to-Meteroderate KOsteoarthritis; thus, the study results Meteray only be valid for individuals with Meterild-to-Meteroderate KOsteoarthritis. The use of a large saMeterple size will also address the current study’s liMeteritation of relying on a relatively sMeterall study population and the fact that it is not a Meterulticenter trial. In conclusion, this study atteMeterpts to estiMeterate the effect of Whole body vibration intervention on outcoMeteres, including daily life function and neuroMeteruscular control, in individuals with KOsteoarthritis. The study results Meteray provide evidence to support the beneficial effects of a Whole body vibration exercise prograMeter on the physical perforMeterance and neuroMeteruscular control of individuals with KOsteoarthritis. The findings of this study will fill the research gap in the efficacy of Whole body vibration based on the results of the proposed project. Further coMeterprehensive research on the exercise rehabilitation of KOsteoarthritis will be proposed. FurtherMeterore, the possible MeterechanisMeter of postural instability in KOsteoarthritis patients Meteray be discussed.
