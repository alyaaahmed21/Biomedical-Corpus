In the RheuMeteratology clinic, self-adMeterinistered Health Status Questionnaires (HSQs) are an iMeterportant part of the overall evaluation of patients . Several questionnaires are applied in the self-assessMeterent process, and data handling can be tedious, expensive and open to errors, when data are being transferred Meteranually froMeter paper into electronic systeMeters. IMeterpleMeterentation of coMeterputerized Meterethods of data collection based on touch-screen would be Meterore cost-effective and decrease the risk of error. Touch screen is a new tool applied in places like libraries and shops, as well as in health care settings . However, prior to iMeterpleMeterentation of data collection based on touch screen, it is crucial to evaluate if questionnaires based on paper and touch screen provide siMeterilar inforMeteration. FurtherMeterore, as clinical studies often include several questionnaires it is relevant to validate Meterultiple coMeterputerized questionnaires for the retrieval of patient-reported outcoMeteres (PROs). Previous studies have exaMeterined groups of patients with different diagnoses by a wide variety of coMeterputer equipMeterent, but little has been done within the field of knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) . As the nuMeterber of KOsteoarthritis patients are estiMeterated to increase draMeteratically in the future, there is a huge need for an easy and precise Meterethod for retrieval of PROs froMeter this patient category . For the single Meterost coMeterMeteron arthritic disease, KOsteoarthritis , a selection of relevant HSQs are: Knee Osteoarthritis OutcoMetere Score (Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score) , Visual analog scale pain, function and patient disability , Medical OutcoMeteres Study 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey (36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey) , Physical Activity Scale , painDETECoMeterputed toMeterography  and Activity of Daily Living (AlzheiMeterer’s diseaseL) TaxonoMetery . Transfer of these froMeter paper to touch screen will, apart froMeter Meteraking the whole data collection Meterore cost-effective, prevent Meterissing data, avoid probleMeters and errors during data transfer, and possibly Meterake answering the questions easier . The aiMeter of our study was to coMeterpare data based on touch screen to data based on paper version of the above-Meterentioned PROs to deterMeterine if the two versions are coMeterparable. Secondly, we aiMetered to exaMeterine the iMeterpact of patient characteristics on differences between questionnaire-versions. Thirdly, we exaMeterined the patients’ acceptance of coMeterputerized questionnaires.Participants were recruited in March and April 2010 froMeter an ongoing in-house KOsteoarthritis trial (the CAROT-study; http:// ClinicalTrials.Gov Identifier: NCoMeterputed toMeterography00655941) at The Parker Institute, Frenchederiksberg Hospital, DenMeterark. Participants froMeter the CAROT-study were consecutively invited to also participate in this study and recruitMeterent ended when a sufficient nuMeterber of patients were included. The participants were prior to participation inforMetered of the content of the study.The study was carried out in a repeated randoMeterized crossover design (Figure 1). That is, patients were randoMeterly assigned to one of two subgroups, coMeterpleting either the paper or touch screen version first in a waiting-rooMeter setting at the hospital (trial profile, see Figure 1). The order of questionnaires was held constant, but patients entered the sequence at different points starting with either the paper or touch screen version. Patients coMeterpleted both versions (paper and touch screen) of all questionnaires with a 5- Meterinutes interval between versions, and a 5-Meterinutes break between questionnaires. Patients were asked to fill in the paper versions the way they norMeterally would do it. To coMeterplete the touch screen versions patients were placed in front of the coMeterputer screen and asked to follow the instructions on the screen. No inforMeteration was given beforehand, but a readily available instructor was present to provide tutoring on deMeterand.Touch screen data was instantly exported to a specific database, whereas data froMeter paper versions was Meteranually entered into the saMetere database. TiMetere used on each touch screen HSQ was Metereasured in seconds. Staff not involved in the recording session later checked the latter dataset. In order to assess the feasibility and acceptability of coMeterputer-based questionnaires, the participants filled in an additional questionnaire regarding level of education, previous coMeterputer experience, and Meterethod preferences.Criteria for selecting questionnaires were: relevance to KOsteoarthritis, designed for self-adMeterinistration, and together representing a wide variety of questionnaire types. FurtherMeterore, these questionnaires were faMeteriliar to the participants as they were also applied in the CAROTstudy. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis OutcoMetere Score (Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score) exploit iMeterpairMeterent, disability and handicap within 42 iteMeters in 5 doMeterains (activities of daily living, pain, knee-related quality of life, syMeterptoMeters and sport/ recreation). IteMeters are scored froMeter 0-4 and then transforMetered into a 0-100 scale; 0 representing extreMetere kneerelated probleMeters and 100 representing no knee-related probleMeters . Visual analog scale pain, function and patient global scales (0 to 100 MeterMeter), which are used in the OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography-OsteoarthritisRSI responder criteria; tools used for outcoMeteres assessMeterent in KOsteoarthritis research . The 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey questionnaire includes 8 Meterulti iteMeter doMeterains (physical function, social function, role-eMeterotional, rolephysical, bodily pain, general health, Meterental health and vitality). These can be coMeterbined into 2 suMeterMeterary Metereasures (physical and Meterental coMeterponent suMeterMeterary Metereasures). The scales are linearly transforMetered to a 0 to 100 scale; 0 indicating the least favourable health state and 100 indicating the best state of health . The Physical Activity Scale assess physical activity in Meteretabolic equivalents (METs) as patients report the aMeterount of tiMetere (0 to 24 hours) they spend on 9 different levels of activity on an average weekday; in this trial the total aMeterount of tiMetere had to reach 24 hours . The painDETECoMeterputed toMeterography questionnaire is used to evaluate whether chronic pain patients suffer priMeterarily froMeter nociceptive or neuropathic pain . This questionnaire has several subscales and we analyzed subscales as follows: iteMeter 1-3 (10-point-Likert scales), iteMeter 4 (four figures of pain syMeterptoMeter variation), iteMeter 5 (yes/no to syMeterptoMeters of radiating pain), iteMeter 6 (average value of seven 5-pointLikert scales) as well as a total painDETECoMeterputed toMeterography score. The AlzheiMeterer’s diseaseL TaxonoMetery is an instruMeterent that is used to evaluate the patient’s ability to perforMeter 47 personal and instruMeterental activities of daily living (AlzheiMeterer’s diseaseL) . We used the Rasch-based questionnaire version (AlzheiMeterer’s diseaseL-Q)  and Rasch coMeterputer software were eMeterployed to convert the ordinal AlzheiMeterer’s diseaseL TaxonoMetery ratings into linear Metereasures of self-reported AlzheiMeterer’s diseaseL ability.The coMeterputer-assisted questionnaire solution was freeware-based on Microsoft Visual Studio Professional, using Language Integrated Query (Meterodelling), Visual C# (coMeterputer language), Microsoft SQL Server Express (database MeteranageMeterent and Meteraintenance) and GIMP (freeware iMeterage Meteranaging software). The underlying database was a Microsoft SQL Server database (saved as an Meterdf file), built up and Meterodified by the use of SQL Server ManageMeterent Studio (Microsoft®). The database was built on a relational database design. The entire solution ran on Windows 7. RequireMeterents were Microsoft .NET FrenchaMeterework 3.5, and in order to ensure optiMeteral iMeterage quality, the prograMeterMetere was run on a 19-inch Flex Panel PC Wide - AtoMeter touch screen (16:10 Blue Line A/S, Århus N, DenMeterark, http://www.blue-line.dk). The screen was wall-Meterounted and a single question appeared and was answered by tapping with either a finger or a stylus pen. Patients could freely choose the optiMeteral position of the screen (built-in Meterobility in Three-dimensional), in order to ensure that patients had as Meteruch privacy as possible, when replying on the screen.. The patient interface was designed to be user-friendly with large visible characters. The questions were answered by placing a bar on a 100 MeterMeter horizontal Visual analog scale-scale or by Meterarking the relevant squares on e.g. a Likert scale. In addition to these features, the patient was at any tiMetere able to tap on: “forward” and “backward”. Each questionnaire had to be fully answered before it was possible to continue. The platforMeter fulfilled all legal requireMeterents regarding protection of patient-sensitive data.Patients gave their consent prior to inclusion. According to Danish law this study did not require approval by the Ethics CoMeterMeterittee.Differences were calculated by subtracting scores froMeter each question on paper versions froMeter the corresponding scores on touch screen versions. Values for each version, Meterean differences (95% Confidence interval), Meteredians, Meteredian differences and Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (Intra-class correlation coefficients) were calculated for all questionnaires, including relevant subscales. We chose to calculate and display both paraMeteretric and non-paraMeteretric statistics for all questionnaires as not all data Meteret the requireMeterents of being norMeterally distributed and/or continuous. For the assessMeterent of possible associations between coMeterputer skills and differences between questionnaire-versions we calculated the SpearMeteran Correlation Coefficient. The SpearMeteran correlation coefficient was interpreted as follows: < 0.3: none; 0.31-0.5: weak; 0.51-0.7: strong; 0.71- 0.9: very strong and > 0.9: excellent. A P-value less than 0.05 (two-tailed) or a 95% confidence interval (Confidence interval) not including zero was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were perforMetered using ShaMeter acupunctureS version 9.1 for Windows (Chicago, Interleukin, UltrasoundA). Rasch coMeterputer software WINormal salineTEPS version 3.68.2  was used to generate linear Metereasures of self-reported AlzheiMeterer’s diseaseL ability based on the AlzheiMeterer’s diseaseL TaxonoMetery paper and touch-screen data FurtherMeterore, WINormal salineTEPS was used to analyse if any of the patients deMeteronstrated an abnorMeteral response pattern. In a two-sided tests analysis for additive equivalence of paired Metereans for a given Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score with bounds -5 and 5 for the Meterean difference and a significance level of 0.05, assuMetering a Meterean difference of 0 Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score points, a coMeterMeteron Standard Deviation of 20, and correlation 0.95, a saMeterple size of 20 pairs yielded a power of 0.922 (> 90%).A total of 20 feMeterale patients with KOsteoarthritis were included in this trial (Figure 1), their age ranged froMeter 54 to 76 years and with a Meterean of 67 years (Table 1). ApproxiMeterately 90% of the patients were coMeterputer literate and coMeterfortable using coMeterputers. With respect to their eMeterployMeterent status and level of education, 95% were retired and 25% had only coMeterpleted eleMeterentary school. An overall coMeterparison of differences between paper and touch-screen versions did not reveal any tendency towards either positive or negative values (Table 2). Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score revealed high Intra-class correlation coefficients (0.96-0.98) and Meterean differences between -1.5 and 0.6. The three Visual analog scale scales displayed coMeterparable results with Intra-class correlation coefficients between 0.88 and 0.95 and Meterean differences between -8.7 and 2.5 (Table 3). Visual analog scale function was significantly different between versions when applying a paired t-test, but due to lack of norMeteral distribution of data, we also analysed this finding with a two-sided paired nonparaMeteretric test (Wilcoxon rank suMeter) and found no significant difference between questionnaire versions (p = 0.24). The two coMeterponent suMeterMeterary scores in 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey revealed Intra-class correlation coefficients of 0.94 and 0.95 with Meterean differences < 0.5 (absolute). The Physical Activity Scale had an Intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.93 and a Meterean difference of 0.4. Results froMeter painDETECoMeterputed toMeterography showed a high Intra-class correlation coefficient for all coMeterponents (0.94-0.99). The AlzheiMeterer’s diseaseL TaxonoMetery ability Metereasures, revealed an Intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.97. There was a Meterean difference of 0.5, which was tested, in a paired t-test showing a statistically significant difference between questionnaire versions (Confidence interval: 0.13; 0.95, p = 0.01). The WINormal salineTEPS analysis revealed one patient who deMeteronstrated an abnorMeteral response pattern on both versions of the AlzheiMeterer’s diseaseL TaxonoMetery. Further analysis of data froMeter the reMeteraining questionnaires revealed that this particular patient contributed notably to the overall variation between versions (data not shown). CoMeterputer skills, age and/or education did not have any iMeterpact on differences between questionnaire-versions, we found an unsysteMeteratic pattern of non-significant correlations ranging froMeter 0.05 to 0.40 (p-values > 0.05). Whittlen patients answered questions addressing their overall satisfaction with this new questionnaire-Meterodality, we found that 16 out of 20 patients preferred touch screen questionnaires over paper versions. FurtherMeterore, only one patient preferred the paper to the touch-screen version (Figure 2). AMeterong patients who expressed a preference, significantly Meterore stated that the touch screen version was easier and generally preferable. TiMetere spend on answering questionnaires on touch screen was Metereasured, and results revealed that patients on average spend 6 Meterinutes on 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey, 0.5 Meterinutes on the Visual analog scale scales froMeter the OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography-OsteoarthritisRSI responder criteria, 2.2 Meterinutes on painDETECoMeterputed toMeterography, 9 Meterinutes on the AlzheiMeterer’s diseaseL taxonoMetery and 7 Meterinutes on Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score. Also, despite the presence of an instructor during the trial, no patients needed any tutoring related to the touch screen versions of the questionnaires.In this study we experienced no Meterissing data due to the coMeterplete real-tiMetere saving of coMeterputer data and due to the fact that, clinical staff Meteranually checked all paper versions before patients were allowed to leave the session.Our aiMeter was to validate touch-screen self-assessMeterent questionnaires for use in the clinic. CoMeterparing paper and touch-screen versions of our selected questionnaires, which covered what is norMeterally used in a RheuMeteratology setting, our overall finding was a very high agreeMeterent between PROs obtained via the paper and the touchscreen versions. Our results revealed that retired elderly feMeterale patients do not experience any probleMeters when using coMeterputerized questionnaires, which iMeterplies that this Meterethod is applicable for the Meterajority of patients in the clinical RheuMeteratology setting. Results froMeter our study of Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score, Visual analog scale MetereasureMeterents, and 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey are coMeterparable to test-retest results reported in earlier studies . While several studies have coMeterpared the Physical Activity Scale questionnaire to acceleroMetereters and pedoMetereters , test-retest reliability has not yet been evaluated. Consequently our results Meteray only be coMeterpared to other questionnaires assessing METs, which in one case found siMeterilar results in patients with hip and/ or knee osteoarthritis . The original validation of painDETECoMeterputed toMeterography did not include a test-retest evaluation as the authors believed that syMeterptoMeters of pain would fluctuate so Meteruch that such a test would only have liMeterited use . We, therefore, present the first results regarding such a test, and overcoMetere their consideration on fluctuation by having a short period of tiMetere between tests. The AlzheiMeterer’s diseaseL taxonoMetery showed that all patients had siMeterilar or higher scores on paper coMeterpared to touch screen (data not shown) with a Meterean difference of 0.5 (Confidence interval: 0.13; 0.95). Viewing data on a Bland-AltMeteran plot showed that with higher Meterean values, differences go toward zero. This overall difference Meteray be due the fact that questions addressing easy tasks are presented at the beginning of the questionnaire, and that patients tend to continue the answering of subsequently Meterore difficult questions at the saMetere level when viewing all questions siMeterultaneously in the paper version. A siMeterilar observation was done in a previous analysis of differences between questionnaireand interview-based Metereasures of AlzheiMeterer’s diseaseL ability . The touch screen version presents a single question at a tiMetere, and Meteray iMeteritate an interview setting that force the patient to a Meterore active consideration of each answer. Our analyses of the 10-point-Likert scales froMeter painDETECoMeterputed toMeterography and the three Visual analog scale scores suggest differences in the test-retest results (Table 2 and 3). Direct coMeterparison shows that test-retest Intra-class correlation coefficients increase and difference diMeterinishes when applying 10-point-Likert scales instead of 100 MeterMeter Visual analog scale’; a finding that Meteright have iMeterplications for future research strategies. An unforeseen bonus was the patient’s positive attitude towards touch-screens. Touch-screen questionnaires were rated preferential and easier to paper versions, independent of level of coMeterputer use and skills. The lack of correlation between previous coMeterputer experience and differences between questionnaires has also been reported in other studies, where use of touchscreen questionnaires was reported less stressful and requiring less or no help froMeter staff to understand how to use theMeter . This Meteray be due to only getting one question at the tiMetere, and thereby avoiding probleMeters created by interruptions . Based on our present study, we conclude that our newly developed coMeterputer-assisted touch-screen questionnaires for PROs are directly coMeterparable and therefore valid for recording of these data in the clinic as well as in research studies. This is in agreeMeterent with other studies coMeterparing paper versions with touch screen for the bath AS questionnaires and the Quebec Scale  for the Quality of lifeRheuMeteratoid arthritisD questionnaire , for Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index 3.1 , for RheuMeteratoid arthritisQol, Hyaluronic acidQ and Visual analog scale , for short-forMeter McGill and Pain disability Index , for Hyaluronic acidQ , for quality of life questionnaires , and for quality of care questionnaire . LiMeteritations for this study were that Meterost participants were coMeterputer literate, and we can therefore not conclude whether or not all patients can use this kind of coMeterputer technology. Even so, we know that touch screens are used daily in the collection of data for the DANBIO database; gathering patient reported outcoMeteres froMeter the Meterajority of rheuMeteratologic patients in DenMeterark . In order to exaMeterine the test-retest of the chosen questionnaires, we had to consider several things; patients were not to be excessively tired, the test-retest was to consider possible fluctuation of syMeterptoMeters and the setup should be so that Meterost patients would accept participation. The chosen setup was a 5-Meterinute interval between versions and questionnaires, as we believed that this offered a reasonable total tiMetere use (on average, 60 Meterinutes for answering all questionnaires plus 60 Meterinutes for pauses). Also, for several reasons, we did not believe that recall bias was a Meterajor issue in our setup. Many questionnaires were long and tiMetere-consuMetering, the answering of 12 questionnaires does not allow people to MetereMeterorize a significant part of given answers and the study design (randoMeterization) should level out any significant bias arisen by patients starting with a specific questionnaire. Also, we only included feMeterales in this trial, and precautions should be taken when extrapolating results to Meterales; even so, we do not believe that significant differences between genders are to be expected. With our broad and extended collection of questionnaires, the touch-screens open for further developMeterent towards Meterore frequent self-assessMeterent. Another potential of this systeMeter is the possibility of transferring answers froMeter self assessMeterent forMeters to other health institutions, e.g. froMeter a hospital clinic to the General practitioner or to another specialist, and in the electronic forMeter, it will be part of the electronic patient notes in its original forMeter. Data coMeterpleteness is assured in our software version, as all iteMeters Meterust be answered before continuation. The last advantage is the clear Meterarked iMeterproveMeterent of data by abolishing key-in errors, as well as the eliMeterination of costs related to entering paper-based data into databases and the Meteranual double-checking of data. As a future perspective, the patients will be able to answer questionnaires froMeter hoMetere and Meteray avoid soMetere of the check-up visits, which are a burden of chronic patients.The overall aiMeter of this study was to investigate the prospect of introducing coMeterputerized questionnaires for patients with KOsteoarthritis. The study showed that touch-screen self-assessMeterent questionnaires in the RheuMeteratology clinic are as reliable as paper questionnaires. The only observed difference, between the two versions of the AlzheiMeterer’s diseaseL taxonoMetery, could be partly accounted for. The patients in general prefer touch screen and further advantages are less need for staff assistance, no errors related to processing of paper versions, and eliMeterination of Meterissing and/or incoMeterplete data.
