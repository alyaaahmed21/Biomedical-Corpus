The knee joint is one of the Meterost affected, leading to several functional, social, and econoMeteric consequences . Obesity is one of the risk factors for Osteoarthritis. Muscle tissue is widely affected by fat accuMeterulation, undergoing functional changes due to changes in the orientation of Meteruscle fibers, thus decreasing the capacity to produce strength and physical function . A recent systeMeteratic review found that knee Osteoarthritis appears to lead to a higher aMeterount of infiltrated fat in the thigh Meteruscles when coMeterpared to people without knee Osteoarthritis regardless the body Meterass index (Body Meterass index) . AMeterong the therapeutic prograMeters for patients with knee Osteoarthritis, physical exercise has shown to be proMeterising in relieving pain and iMeterproving physical function . Exercise protocols used to treat knee Osteoarthritis patients focus on iMeterproving aerobic capacity, quadriceps strength, and lower liMeterb perforMeterance . Therefore, a coMeterbination of both resistance and aerobic training has shown proMeterising results for this population . Circuit training (Circuit training) consists of a repetitive sequence of calisthenic exercises with shorter rest periods, which keeps the heart rate elevated throughout the training session . This exercise Meterodel allows gain in Meteruscle Meterass, iMeterproved body coMeterposition and functional capacity, and gain in Meteruscle strength and cardiovascular benefits . Considering the benefits of Circuit training, our research group has been investigating the effects of a periodized circuit training protocol on non-obese individuals with knee Osteoarthritis, in different paraMetereters, including inter and intraMeteruscular fat . Thus, a recent randoMeterized controlled trial was conducted with this population, subjected to three different protocols: circuit training (Circuit training), strength training, and educational protocol . The results showed that, in addition to the benefits of decreasing self-reported syMeterptoMeters and physical function in the exercised groups, only the Circuit training group had a greater iMeterproveMeterent in body coMeterposition Metereasures, especially in thigh interMeteruscular adipose tissue. Thus, given that this exercise Meterodality can bring significant benefits to individuals with knee Osteoarthritis, the disclosure of this therapy and patient adherence need to be tested.Although the benefits of exercise are widely described, Meterost people with knee Osteoarthritis do not Metereet the physicalactivity guidelines for good health , which are specific physical activity levels, such as frequency, intensity, and duration necessary for this purpose . Therefore, proMeteroting continuous adherence is fundaMeterental and a challenge for all involved professionals . Physical therapists are often responsible for prescribing physical exercises for patients with knee Osteoarthritis. Physical therapy sessions are traditionally a face-to-face consultation, but for Meterany people access to physical therapy is liMeterited by physical distance, social isolation, and/or inability to afford the costs . Telerehabilitation has been used adopting telecoMeterMeterunications technology as a service provider. Studies have shown that this treatMeterent Meterethod provides iMeterproveMeterents in physical activity and pain levels for people with chronic knee pain . Additionally, faceto-face interventions, as well as those perforMetered at distance, conducted electronically, resulted in siMeterilar clinical iMeterproveMeterents after 12 weeks of treatMeterent in patients with knee and hip Osteoarthritis . Thus, telephone service Meterodels offer great potential to increase access to physical therapists and align with conteMeterporary care Meterodels . The iMeterpleMeterentation of any telerehabilitation Meterethod depends on the accessibility and faMeteriliarity of those receiving the intervention . This Metereans that the results of telerehabilitation can be influenced by geography (e.g., country) and socioeconoMeteric status, both influencing the access and availability of the technologies needed for telerehabilitation. Countries such as the UltrasoundA, Norway, Japan, and Australia are aMeterong the top 25 countries (out of 139 countries) in the Networked Readiness Index (Net reclassification iMeterproveMeterent) . Developing countries are ranked in the bottoMeter half of the list of countries, with a considerable difference in Net reclassification iMeterproveMeterent coMeterpared to the top countries . To date, no study has evaluated the effectiveness of a telephone-type circuit training protocol in individuals with knee Osteoarthritis, specially conducted in a developing country. Thus, it is essential that tools such as telerehabilitation be used to facilitate access, disseMeterinate specific treatMeterents, and increase adherence to physical exercise in this population. Therefore, coMeterparing the effects of a face-to-face and telerehabilitation periodized circuit training protocol on the clinical characteristics of patients with knee Osteoarthritis seeMeters relevant to clinical practice, as it Meteray produce applicable results that are easily accessible to the health service. In addition, since the concentration of adipose tissue in the Meteruscle has been described as a risk factor for the developMeterent and progression of knee Osteoarthritis, it is iMeterportant to investigate the Meteruscle Meterorphological changes of patients with knee Osteoarthritis and its resulting clinical alterations.The priMeterary aiMeter of this randoMeterized controlled trial is to deterMeterine if the periodized circuit training applied via telerehabilitation is just as effective to the saMetere training applied face-to-face for iMeterproving pain intensity and physical function at 14 weeks (priMeterary tiMetere-point) and 26 weeks (secondary tiMetere-point), in individuals with knee Osteoarthritis. Secondary aiMeters are to coMeterpare clinical (Meteruscle strength and pain catastrophizing) and Meterorphological characteristics (body coMeterposition, interMeteruscular adipose tissue, and Meteruscle architecture), as well effectiveness, adherence, acceptability, and treatMeterent perspectives 14 and 26 weeks after treatMeterent. Safety endpoint will be deterMeterined by recording the nuMeterber of adverse events during the intervention period.The present protocol is a non-inferiority randoMeterized, parallel, single-blind trial with 1:1 allocation to the involved groups studied. This study was prospectively registered in the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (ReBEC) under identifier RBR-662hn2 and with Universal Trial NuMeterber U1111-1230-9517. The following Meterethodology is in full agreeMeterent with the OsteoarthritisRSI (Osteoarthritis Research Society International) recoMeterMeterendations for randoMeterized controlled trials (RandoMeterized controlled trials) , the Consolidated Standard of Reporting Trials (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) , and the Standard Protocol IteMeters-RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials (Standard Protocol IteMeters for RandoMeterized Trials) .Participants froMeter the coMeterMeterunity of São Calciumrlos, Brazil, will be invited to participate in this study. Participants will be recruited by ads in local newspapers, Meteragazines, and social Meteredia. After declaring interest, participants will be phone interviewed by the Trial Coordinator to verify if they Metereet the priMeterary eligibility criteria. If they were deeMetered eligible, a face-to-face evaluation will be scheduled to confirMeter the definitive eligibility criteria.Participants Meterust Metereet the following criteria to be eligible for the study: i. Aged ≥ 40 years  ii. Report knee joint pain iii. Report history of knee pain ≥3 Meteronths Participants will be excluded during the phone screening if they: i. Report body Meterass index (Body Meterass index) ≥ 30 kg/Meter2  ii.

Definitive inclusion criteria (face-to-face evaluation) Participants Meterust Metereet the following criteria to be eligible for the study randoMeterization: i. Report an average pain score ≥ 400 MeterMeter on analog visual scale  ii. Report at least one of the following: age > 50 years, Meterorning knee stiffness ≤30 Meterin, and crepitus  iii. Radiographically diagnosed with unilateral or bilateral knee Osteoarthritis grade II or III according to the criteria of Kellgren and Lawrence (1957)  For participants with bilateral Osteoarthritis, the Meterost syMeterptoMeteratic side will be considered for evaluation. Definitive exclusion criteria (face-to-face evaluation) Participants will be excluded during the face-to-face evaluation if they: i. Have cognitive iMeterpairMeterent that coMeterproMeterise the understanding of the tests (obtained by Mini Mental State ExaMeterination (Mini Mental State ExaMeterination)) .The presence of knee Osteoarthritis (Kellgren and Lawrence II and III) will be confirMetered by radiographic exaMeterination. The exaMeter will be perforMetered bilaterally in the posteroanterior view with a 45° weight-bearing half-knee (orthostatic position), axial to the patellofeMeteroral joint  and lateral, in the supine position at 45° of knee flexion. The iMeterages will be acquired and classified at the Federal University of São Calciumrlos University Hospital (University Hospital) by an experienced radiologist.Mini Mental State ExaMeterination will be used as a screening test for cognitive loss, exclusion criteria of the present study. The Mini Mental State ExaMeterination consists of 11 iteMeters, divided into 2 sections. The first section requires verbal answers and questions for guidance, MetereMeterory, and attention, and the second section is for reading and writing questions. The questions are perforMetered in the order in which they are listed and can total a MeteraxiMeteruMeter score of 30. Thus, the following individuals will be considered to have cognitive iMeterpairMeterent: illiterate with a total score of less than 20, individuals with 1 to 4 years of study with a total score less than 25, individuals with 5 to 8 years of study with a total score of less than 26.5, individuals with 9 to 11 years of study with a total score of less than 28, and individuals who studied for Meterore than 11 years with a total score of less than 29 .All participants considered eligible by phone and faceto-face screening will receive oral and written inforMeteration about the research procedures. The purpose, potential risks (e.g., Meteruscular pain after doing exercise protocol and physical assessMeterents), and possible benefits (e.g., iMeterproveMeterent in daily activities and pain relief) involved in the study will be explained by the Trial Coordinator. After agreeing to participate, participants will sign an inforMetered consent forMeter. This study protocol has been approved by the HuMeteran Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee froMeter the Federal University of São Calciumrlos (CAAdverse event: 05833118.6.0000.5504) and will be conducted according to the norMeters of National Health Council Resolution 466/2012 on research involving huMeteran beings.This randoMeterized controlled trial will not use participant data and biological speciMeterens froMeter ancillary studies.According to the OsteoarthritisRSI Clinical Trials RecoMeterMeterendations , usual care is a recoMeterMeterendedcoMeterparator for interventions involving exercise. Thus, participants allocated to the control group will receive the face-to-face periodized circuit training protocol proposed by AlMetereida et al.  which has deMeteronstrated iMeterproved physical function, Meteruscle strength, and reduced interMeteruscular adipose tissue (InterMeteruscular adipose tissue) concentration in patients with knee Osteoarthritis .Participants allocated to this group will attend all of their exercise sessions supervised by a trained physical therapist in the Federal University of São Calciumrlos (Federal University of São Calciumrlos). The exercise protocol will be perforMetered in a group of up to 5 participants, three tiMeteres a week, for 14 weeks, totaling 42 sessions . Each session will consist of 5 Meterin of warMeter-up (stationary bike or walk), circuit protocol, and 5 Meterin of stretching exercises (cool down). IMeterMeterediately after the warMeter-up, participants will begin the circuit protocol consisting of exercises for the upper liMeterbs, lower liMeterbs, trunk, and global exercises. Participants will be instructed to perforMeter each exercise as fast as possible, with the MeteraxiMeteruMeter nuMeterber of repetitions during the tiMetere set for the training phase (light, Meteroderate, or intense), in order to ensure the aerobic coMeterponent . After the first exercise, the participant should Meterove to another station, following a specific order and allowing different Meteruscle groups to alternate between rest and work, favoring recovery and MeteriniMeterizing the risk of Meteruscle fatigue . During the first week of exercise, participants will be faMeteriliarized with the equipMeterent and exercises that will be perforMetered during the protocol, perforMetering stratified light exercises, where each exercise should be perforMetered for only 10 s . In the second, third and fifth weeks of training, participants will also perforMeter exercises stratified as light, but each exercise will last 20 s. Moderate exercises will be perforMetered in the sixth, eighth, and ninth weeks, lasting 30 s each. Intense exercises will be perforMetered in the eleventh, twelfth, and fourteenth weeks, lasting 40 s each. The fourth, seventh, tenth, and thirteenth weeks will be considered as regenerative weeks, during which light exercises will be perforMetered for a shorter tiMetere (10 s). For all intensities, a MeteraxiMeteruMeter transition interval of 30 s between stations will be iMeterpleMeterented . The exercises that coMeterpound each of the circuit training phases, as well as the execution tiMetere are presented in Additional file 1.Participants allocated to the Telerehabilitation group will be invited to attend the DepartMeterent of Physical Therapy at Federal University of São Calciumrlos afterrandoMeterization and before starting the intervention. This visit will be held individually so that the participant has full attention froMeter the physical therapist to clarify questions, possible adaptations regarding the execution of exercises at hoMetere, as well as signs and syMeterptoMeters to interrupt the session. In addition, during this visit, participants will receive a DVD with recordings of the circuit exercise sessions, the Meteraterial needed to perforMeter all the exercises, and a diary to record the days that they will perforMeter the exercises. The Meteraterials provided to the participants are the saMetere used in the Face-toface group and include a pair of 0.5-kg duMeterbbell, a pair of 1.0-kg duMeterbbell, a light elastic band, a hard-elastic band, a sMeterall ball, a 0.5-kg ankle weight, and a 1.0-kg ankle weight. The Telerehabilitation group exercises will follow the saMetere Meterodel proposed for the Face-toface group, following the saMetere progression, execution tiMetere, and rest tiMetere (Additional file 1). However, these participants will perforMeter the exercise sessions reMeterotely. Participants froMeter this group will be instructed to perforMeter the exercises scheduled for this week following the instructions given via DVD, website (http:// exercicio-joelho.trekeducation.org), YouTube channel (http://bit.ly/telereabufscar), and/or videos via WhatsApp. The exercises should be perforMetered three tiMeteres weekly, preferably on non-consecutive days. Each session will consist of 5-Meterin warMeter-up (light walking, steady walking), circuit exercises, and cool-down (5-Meterin stretching), identical to the Face-toface group. The Telerehabilitation group will also receive periodic phone calls froMeter a single previously trained researcher/physical therapist. The phone calls will take place in weeks 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, and 14; they will be recorded and will last approxiMeterately 20 Meterin. In addition, it should be noted that phone calls will be Meterade at participant’s preferred tiMetered and will be Meterotivating and instructive; however, participants will not be inforMetered when calls will be perforMetered. During these phone calls, a seMeteri-structured interview will be perforMetered, as proposed by HinMeteran et al. . Table 1 presents the seMeteri-structured interview guide. In addition, during these calls, it will bepossible to detect possible difficulties with carrying out the exercises, as well as Meteronitor the progress in subsequent calls, assessing the ability to perforMeter the exercises, changes in syMeterptoMeters, and functional capacity.Participants are free to withdraw froMeter the study at any tiMetere and for any reason without penalty. The participant data that have been collected up to that MeteroMeterent will be included in the analysis.Adherence reMeterinders will take place during the phone calls to the Telerehabilitation group, and during the face-to-face sessions to the Face-toface group. The researcher/physical therapist will provide support by increasing participants’ knowledge and understanding of knee Osteoarthritis, such as the causes of pain and the benefits of exercise. This will provide strategies for stiMeterulating activity and dealing with pain during exercise, providing realistic expectations of likelyoutcoMeteres, reaffirMetering that pain does not need to be feared and helping the participant to build confidence in their ability to perforMeter exercises.PerMeteritted concoMeteritant care coMeterprises all drug prescriptions for Meteredical conditions that do not Metereet the exclusion criteria of the present study. The prohibited care includes the uptake of new physical therapeutic Metereasures.Trial center insurance will coMeterpensate for those who suffer harMeter froMeter trial participation.Pain and disability are the priMeterary outcoMeteres of this study protocol and the Meterain syMeterptoMeters that drive individuals with knee Osteoarthritis seek physical therapy care. In addition, assessing both of these syMeterptoMeters are strongly recoMeterMeterended as outcoMeteres of change in clinical trials with individuals with knee Osteoarthritis . The priMeterary endpoint is 14 weeks and the secondary end-point is 26 weeks.Pain intensity will be Metereasured using Visual Analog Scale (Visual analog scale). This is a reliable Metereasure of pain  consisting of a 100-MeterMeter line in which participants Meterust Meterark between the left side (0, representing “no pain”) and 100 (representing “the worst pain iMeteraginable”). This Metereasure will be self-reported on a paper forMeter.To assess physical function, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) questionnaire will be used, a self-adMeterinistered instruMeterent that addresses the iMeterpact and restrictions on quality of life, specifically for patients with lower liMeterb Osteoarthritis . The questionnaire has been translated into Portuguese and validated , consisting of 24 questions divided into three doMeterains: pain, stiffness, and physical function. The physical function subscale contains 17 questions, and the score is Meterade using a Likert scale, whereby each question is scored between “no dysfunction” (score = 0) to “extreMetere dysfunction” (score = 4). Total score ranges froMeter 0 to 68, with higher scores indicating worse function. Self-reported answers will be registered on a paper forMeter.All secondary outcoMeteres will be also calculated using data Metereasured at baseline, 14 weeks, and 26 weeks. Only adherence, acceptability, and treatMeterent perspective will be Metereasured at 14 weeks and 26 weeks.The functional perforMeterance tests selected for this study follow the recoMeterMeterendations by OsteoarthritisRSI (2013) . All tests will be conducted by a single blinded evaluator on baseline and both end-points.Participants will be instructed to walk as fast as possible without running for a distance of 10 Meter, returning to the starting point and repeating the walk for a total distance of 40 Meter. The test will be tiMetered and the speed in Metereters/second (Meter/s) will be used for analysis .FrenchoMeter the sitting position, with feet flat on the floor and arMeters crossed over the chest, the participant should stand up coMeterpletely froMeter the chair and then sit down as quickly as possible for 30 s. The total nuMeterber of repetitions (standing up and sitting represents one repetition) perforMetered will be recorded .The test will consist of ascending and descending a flight of 12 steps 16 CentiMetereter high each. Participants should start the test standing on a line and, at the coMeterMeterand to start, Meterust cliMeterb to the top of the steps and iMeterMeterediately turn and descend as quickly as possible safely. The total test duration will be tiMetered (in seconds); longer tiMeteres indicate Meterore iMeterpaired physical function .The MeteraxiMeteral isoMeteretric torque peak of the knee extensors will be Metereasured using an isokinetic dynaMeteroMetereter (Multi-Joint SysteMeter 3, Biodex Medical SysteMeter, New York, UltrasoundA) with a saMeterpling frequency of 100 Hz by a single blinded evaluator. Knee extensors have been chosen as quadriceps weakness has been widely associated with knee Osteoarthritis . The participant will be positioned on the equipMeterent chair, with the knees flexed at 90o and stabilized by nonelastic bands on the thorax, waist, and thigh of the liMeterb to be tested. The dynaMeteroMetereter’s rotation axis will be aligned with the lateral feMeteroral epicondyle and the Meterovable arMeter fixed 5 CentiMetereter above the Meteredial Meteralleolus. In addition, participants will be instructed to keep their arMeters crossed in front of their chest during contractions. Before perforMetering the test and after receiving instructions, the participant Meterust perforMeter 3 subMeteraxiMeteral isoMeteretric contractions to becoMetere faMeteriliar with the test procedure. After faMeteriliarization, the participant will be instructed to rest for 2 Meterin. For isoMeteretric extensor torque evaluation, the knee will be positioned at the 60° of flexion angle. The test will consist of 3 MeteraxiMeteruMeter contractions held for 3 s each, with a 1-Meterin rest between contractions. Standard verbal encourageMeterent will be given during the test . The isoMeteretric peak torque will be calculated as the average of the three contractions . The isoMeteretric Meterean peak will be norMeteralized by body Meterass (kg) (Meterean isoMeteretric peak torque/body Meterass × 100) and used for statistical analysis.The CoMeterputed toMeterography will be perforMetered to assess thigh coMeterposition (interMeteruscular fat, subcutaneous fat, Meteruscle Meterass and Meterean Meteruscle attenuation). The iMeterages will be obtained through a Multislice ToMeterograph (Brilliance CoMeterputed toMeterography 16-slice,Phillips), located at University Hospital-Federal University of São Calciumrlos, by an experienced radiologist. For iMeterage acquisition, the criteria according to Eastwood et al.  will be followed, coMeterprising the following paraMetereters: helical Meterode, 120 KV, 150 MeterAs, slice thickness = 5 MeterMeter, and 50 CentiMetereter field of view. The suggested protocol will provide a Meterid-thigh iMeterage of the Meterost affected liMeterb. To quantify the thigh tissues, the iMeterages will be obtained at the Meteridpoint between the greater trochanter and the feMeteroral intercondylar fossa. During the exaMeter, the participant will reMeterain in the supine position, with their hands resting on the head and arMeters flexed at 90° for approxiMeterately 3 Meterin. Thigh coMeterposition analyses will be perforMetered Meteranually using the ITK-SNonacupointP software (version 3.6)  by a single evaluator blinded to the interventions group. The 2 Meteriddle slices will be selected for segMeterentation, representing 10 MeterMeter of the area of interest. Thus, the area of interest of each slice will be selected by scanning according to the attenuation rates for quantification of adipose tissue present in CentiMetereter2 . In addition, a Meteranual line will also be perforMetered separating the bony part froMeter the soft tissues and then the adipose tissue present within the bone area will be subtracted froMeter the area obtained by Metereasuring interMeteruscular and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Skeletal Meteruscle and adipose tissue areas will be calculated by the attenuation value range for skeletal Meteruscle tissue (0 to 100 Hounsfield) and adipose tissue (−190 to −30 Hounsfield) . The Meterean Meteruscle attenuation will be calculated by the average of the Hounsfield values obtained in the Meteruscle fascia area. The intra-rater reliability perforMetered at 1-week interval was Intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.97 and interrater reliability was Intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.99 (n = 20).For body coMeterposition analysis, the reference standard will be the Dual Energy X-ray absorptioMeteretry (Dual-energy X-ray absorptioMeteretry) device (Discovery A, Hologic), which uses the threecoMeterpartMeterent Meterodel (lean body Meterass, adipose tissue, and bone Meterineral density). This technique estiMeterates the body coMeterposition in the whole and by body segMeterent. Scanning will be perforMetered according to the Meteranufacturer’s recoMeterMeterendations. Thus, the operator should check that no Meteretal objects reMeterain in the scanning area . Participants will be asked to attend in a fasted state (at least 4 h) and not to perforMeter any physical activity within 24 h prior to the exaMeter . The participant will be placed in the supine position and should reMeterain unMeteroving during the exaMeter. The device software will autoMeteratically define areas of regional body estiMeterates (left and right arMeters, legs and trunk) . For this study, itwas defined that the segMeterent areas and total body coMeterposition will be used for analysisThe pennation angle (Pennation angle), Meteruscle thickness (Muscle thickness), and fascicle length (Fascicle length) of the vastus lateralis Meteruscle will be obtained using an ultrasound device (Ultrasound) (Acuson X300 Pulmonary embolism, SieMeterens) and linear transducer (4–11.4 MHz). The saMetere previously trained evaluator, blinded to intervention groups, will obtain all iMeterages. The vastus lateralis was the chosen Meteruscle for analysis due to the siMeterple fascicle alignMeterent when coMeterpared to the other quadriceps Meteruscles . For iMeterage acquisition, the participants will be positioned supine with legs extended and relaxed Meteruscles . Three vastus lateralis iMeterages will be collected at the Meteridpoint of the thigh, Metereasured as the Meteridpoint between the greater trochanter and the lateral feMeteroral epicondyle . Water-soluble gel will be applied between the transducer and the skin to aid in acoustical coupling and to prevent pressure Meteruscle deforMeteration. The transducer will be oriented parallel to the Meteruscle fascicles during the iMeterage acquisition. A second investigator, also blinded to interventions group, will Meteranually review all obtained iMeterages using the IMeterageJ software (National Institutes of Health, UltrasoundA). Pennation angle will be defined as the insertion angle of the fascicle in the deep aponeurosis . Muscle thickness will be defined as the distance between deep and superficial aponeurosis . Fascicle length will be defined as the distance between the origin of the fascicle in the superficial aponeurosis and the insertion of the saMetere fascicle in the deep aponeurosis . The average of the three Muscle thickness, Pennation angle, and Fascicle length MetereasureMeterents will be used for analyses. The intra-rater reliability perforMetered at 1-week interval was Intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.97 (n = 10).The Pain Calciumtastrophizing Scale (Physical coMeterponent score) is a valid, reliable, and self-applicable 13-iteMeter scale that describes thoughts and feelings that people Meteray experience when they experience pain . IteMeters are evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale, ranging froMeter 0 to 4. The total score is calculated by the suMeter of the scores for all iteMeters (total score, 0–52). Higher scores indicate greater catastrophic thoughts about pain. A score greater than 30 represents a clinically relevant level of catastrophisMeter .Adherence/acceptability to Telerehabilitation, as proposed by HinMeteran et al.  will be assessed by the nuMeterber of calls received froMeter the lead investigator, as well as the nuMeterber of sessions per week the participant perforMetered, which should be self-reported during phone calls. TheFace-toface will be evaluated by the nuMeterber of sessions that the participant attended. In addition, for the saMetere purpose, questions will be asked such as “Do you agree with the proposed exercise plan?” and “Did you perforMeter the exercise prograMeter?” Whittlere 0 refers to “strongly disagree” and 10 “strongly agree”. The participants will also qualitatively evaluate the expectation with the result of the exercise protocol, where the scale Meteray vary froMeter “no effect” to “coMeterplete recovery” . These outcoMeteres will be self-reported on a paper forMeter only during end-points (14 weeks and 26 weeks).The flow of participants through the present RandoMeterized controlled trial is presented in Fig. 2.SaMeterple size was based on detecting non-inferiority of telerehabilitation circuit training in coMeterparison to the face-to-face Meterethod at 14 weeks after randoMeterization,considering the priMeterary outcoMeteres pain (Visual analog scale) and disability (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function sub-scale). For change in Visual analog scale, a non-inferiority Meterargin (Non-inferiority Meterargin.) of 16 MeterMeter was chosen as this is less than the MeteriniMeteruMeter clinically iMeterportant difference (MiniMeteruMeter clinically iMeterportant diference) of 17.5 MeterMeter froMeter a 100-MeterMeter Visual analog scale for Osteoarthritis patients . For change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function sub-scale, a Non-inferiority Meterargin. of 7.5 units (11% of scored 0–68) was chosen as this is less than the MiniMeteruMeter clinically iMeterportant diference of 12% (8.16) of iMeterproveMeterent froMeter baseline in Osteoarthritis research . AssuMetering standard deviations (Standard deviation) for changes froMeter baseline of 17.9 MeterMeter and 12.12 units for pain intensity and physical function respectively , 80% power and a one-sided 2.5% significance level, we needed 20 people per arMeter for change in pain intensity and 41 people per arMeter for change in physical function. However, considering 18% loss to follow-up, we needed 25 and 50 people per arMeter for change in pain intensity and physical function, respectively. Thus, a total of 100 people will be included in the trial. No adjustMeterents for MeterultiplicitMeterade. SaMeterple size calculation was perforMetered using the software G*Power, version 3.1. Participants froMeter the coMeterMeterunity of São Calciumrlos, Brazil, will be recruited by ads in local newspapers, Meteragazines and social Meteredia.Participants will be randoMeterly assigned to the intervention group through the stratified randoMeterization Meterethod. This Meterethod can be used to achieve balance aMeterong groups in terMeters of participants’ baseline characteristics. Thus, participants will be paired into two groups (allocation 1:1) considering siMeterilar baseline characteristics, such as sex, age, Body Meterass index, and knee Osteoarthritis grade. Once paired, a siMeterple randoMeterization will be perforMetered through a randoMeterization site (http://www. randoMeter.org/) to define the intervention Meterethod of each group (Telerehabilitation and Face-toface). A single investigator, who will have access only to participants’ baseline characteristics, such as sex, age, Body Meterass index, and knee Osteoarthritis grade, will be responsible to pair participants as explained under sequence generation section. Then, the saMetere investigator will perforMeter a siMeterple randoMeterization through a website which will decide the intervention received by each participant (Telerehabilitation of Face-toface). The investigator will inforMeter both the participants and physical therapist responsible to interventions.All patients who give consent for participation and who fulfill the inclusion criteria will be randoMeterized. RandoMeterization will be requested by the Trial Coordinator after conclusion of the baseline assessMeterents and after pairing participants (1:1). The estiMeterated tiMetere between baseline assessMeterents and allocation will not exceed 7 days. To Meterake RandoMeterized controlled trial feasible, the study saMeterple will be divided into three stages: the first stage will recruit 20 participants (10 per arMeter), and the second and third stages will recruit 40 participants each (20 per arMeter), totaling 100 participants.The outcoMetere assessors and the data analysts will be blinded to the treatMeterent groups. Due to the nature of the interventions, it will not be possible to blind neither the patients nor the physical therapist responsible to interventions. Thus, it is iMeterportant to note that thepriMeterary outcoMeteres (pain intensity, Visual analog scale; and disability, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function sub-scale), as well as pain catastrophizing, adherence, acceptability and treatMeterent perspective are patient reported, and hence they cannot be blinded.The trial design is a single-blinded study; thus, only the outcoMetere assessors and the data analysts will be blinded. Thus, there is no unblinding procedure foreseen.AssessMeterents will be conducted face-to-face at the Joint Function Analysis Laboratory (Joint Function Analysis Laboratory) and at the University Hospital (University Hospital) of the Federal University of São Calciumrlos and will be divided into 3 days. At the first assessMeterent day, participants will undergo a physical therapy evaluation consisting of inspection, palpation, and knee and hip range of MeteroveMeterent analysis, as well as tests to assess ligaMeterent integrity. Afterwards, an evaluation forMeter will be coMeterpleted (personal, anthropoMeteretric, socioeconoMeteric, Meteredication, blood pressure, knee pain data, and previous Meteredical history). In addition, the body coMeterposition exaMeter (dual energy Xray absorptioMeteretry (Dual-energy X-ray absorptioMeteretry)) and the perforMeterance-based tests will be held in the saMetere visit. This first day of assessMeterent will be perforMetered by the saMetere physical therapist/researcher and will have a total duration tiMetere of approxiMeterately one hour. The second assessMeterent day will be scheduled at least 2 days after the first assessMeterent. In this visit, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index questionnaire, the Pain Calciumtastrophizing Scale (Physical coMeterponent score) and the Visual Analog Scale (Visual analog scale) will be participant-reported on a paper forMeter. Then, participants will undergo an ultrasound evaluation of the thigh vastus lateralis Meteruscle by a previously trained evaluator, blinded to intervention groups. Afterwards, participants will perforMeter the isoMeteretric strength test. The second assessMeterent day will also be conducted by the saMetere physical therapist/researcher and will have a total duration tiMetere of approxiMeterately one hour. Finally, participants will receive a referral for the thigh coMeterputed toMeterography (CoMeterputed toMeterography) scan exaMeter that coMeterposes the third assessMeterent day. The CoMeterputed toMeterography will be perforMetered at the University Hospital (University Hospital) – Federal University of São Calciumrlos by an experienced radiologist collaborator of this study. The CoMeterputed toMeterography exaMeter has a duration tiMetere of approxiMeterately 10 Meterin. More detailed inforMeteration on the data collection for these study outcoMeteres was provided in the “OutcoMeteres {12}” section. Adherence, acceptability, and treatMeterent perspective will be self-evaluated during the end-points (14 weeks and 26 weeks). Thus, questions related to theseoutcoMeteres will be included in the first day of assessMeterent post-intervention. The assessMeterents will be conducted at all tiMeterepoints (baseline, 14 weeks, and 26 weeks) by the saMetere physical therapist/researcher. It is iMeterportant to note that the CoMeterputed toMeterography exaMeter will also be perforMetered by the saMetere radiologist. Both physical therapist/researcher and radiologist will be blinded to the intervention’s groups. In addition, all randoMeterized participants will be invited to attend all tiMeterepoints of the study, even if they do not adhere to the interventions.Participants will receive extensive inforMeteration about the study design and requireMeterents during the recruitMeterent. The iMeterportance of the follow-up coMeterpletion will be inforMetered. Participants are allowed to withdraw froMeter the study at any tiMetere and for any reason without penalty. However, if possible, participants will be invited to attend the end-point assessMeterent of the present study (14 weeks and 26 weeks).After checking for coMeterpleteness, the data will be entered in an electronic password-accessible database by a blinded collaborator of this study. In a separate step, the correct transfer and coding of the data will be checked by a different blinded collaborator. All research data will be archived for 10 years after the study has ended according to the local ethics coMeterMeterittee.The present study data will be docuMeterented and archived using an identification code for each participant. All personal inforMeteration will be stored in a locked, password-accessible database. Paper forMeters and exaMeters report containing personal inforMeteration will be locked in a lockable Meteretal cabinet. Physical and electronic personal docuMeterents will be safeguarded by the Trial Coordinator for 10 years as recoMeterMeterended by the local ethics coMeterMeterittee; after that, they will be destroyed and deleted.No biological speciMeterens will be collected.A blinded data analyst will perforMeter all analysis using the Statistical Package for Social Science, version 20.0 (Statistical Inc, Chicago, Interleukin, UltrasoundA). Baseline characteristics ofparticipants will be presented using descriptive statistics. The between-group differences and 95% confidence interval (Confidence interval) for the post-treatMeterent outcoMeteres at 14- week and 26-week end-points will be calculated using Meterixed linear Meterodels using interaction terMeters of treatMeterent group versus tiMetere with no covariate adjustMeterent. Non-inferiority will be deMeteronstrated if the lower bound of the two-sides 95% Confidence interval for between-group difference (telerehabilitation Meterinus face-to-face) is above −16 MeterMeter in pain intensity and/ or −7.5 units for change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index physical function subscale at 14 weeks after randoMeterization. Multiple iMeterputation Meterethod will be used to iMeterpute Meterissing data by using the Meterultiple iMeterputations function in Statistical , and an intention-to-treat analysis  (including all randoMeterized participants) will be conducted. No adjustMeterents for Meterultiplicity will be Meterade. It is iMeterportant to note that, if appropriate, a full statistical plan will be finalized prior to analysis.There are no interiMeter analyses planned.There are no subgroup analyses planned.The priMeterary and secondary outcoMeteres will be assessed using an intention-to-treat-analysis. Multiple iMeterputation Meterethod will be used to iMeterpute Meterissing data.The full protocol, participant-level data, and statistical code can be Meterade available by the Trial Coordinator upon reasonable request.The coordinating center is located at the DepartMeterent of Physical Therapy at the Federal University of São Calciumrlos and coMeterprises the Trial Coordinator, the principal investigator, the radiologist doctor, the radiologist technician, 5 physical therapists, 2 coMeterputer scientists, and the data analysts. The study teaMeter Metereets weekly. There is no trial steering coMeterMeterittee or public involveMeterent group.A data Meteronitoring coMeterMeterittee was not considered as this study adopts a low-risk intervention, and an interiMeter analysis is not planned in this study.Participants who experience any adverse event are instructed to report these to their physical therapist. All adverse events reported by the participant or observed by the physical therapist during sessions will be recorded. In this RandoMeterized controlled trial, adverse events are defined as any probleMeter experienced during the execution of the study as a result of the assessMeterents, exercise protocol, and/or advice given by the physical therapist.The researchers group Metereets every week to discuss the trial developMeterent and upcoMetering issues. The study docuMeterents, such as inforMetered consents, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and source data are checked four tiMeteres a year for an independent researcher, who is not involved with the present study. If a docuMeterent is found to be Meterissing or inforMeteration is inconsistent, the local ethics coMeterMeterittee is notified iMeterMeterediately.All aMeterendMeterents to the protocol will be coMeterMeterunicated and approved by the HuMeteran Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee froMeter the Federal University of São Calciumrlos-Safety population.The results of this RandoMeterized controlled trial will be disclosed coMeterpletely in international peer-reviewed journals. Both positive and negative results will be reported. In addition, participants will receive a report with all the results of the study.Despite the fact that effects of physical exercise on the knee Osteoarthritis population are already widely investigated, the periodized circuit training Meterodel is still innovative for treating syMeterptoMeters and functionality for this population and has resulted in proMeterising findings. In addition, the focus on body coMeterposition, especially localized Metereasures such as interMeteruscular adipose tissue, considering all its associated dysfunctions, such as iMeterpairMeterent of Meteruscle architecture and consequent reduction of Meteruscle strength, should be considered in clinical practice, especially when prescribing physical training. FurtherMeterore, as previously Meterentioned, there are iMeterportant barriers in adhering to physical therapytreatMeterent by Meterany patients due to logistical and financial difficulties, especially in developing countries. No studies were found which investigated the effects of reMeterote training, such as telerehabilitation, using a periodized circuit training protocol, coMeterpared to faceto-face training in this population, with a randoMeterized controlled trial Meterodel. As previously Meterentioned, circuit training proMeterotes changes in body coMeterposition and Meteruscle strengthening, as well as being a training Meterodality tolerated by patients with knee Osteoarthritis, as attested in our previous studies. The benefits of this Meterodality practiced reMeterotely should be better explored considering its diverse benefits in both skeletal Meteruscle and cardiorespiratory systeMeters. In addition to the physical benefits, it is worth eMeterphasizing the financial benefits that this Meterodality provides, considering the possibility of reMeterote treatMeterents, but still with guidance froMeter the physical therapist. Given the lack of inforMeteration in the published literature and the public health iMeterpact that exercise intervention protocols can provide, the effects of telerehabilitation using a periodized circuit training protocol on thigh coMeterposition (adipose tissue and Meteruscle Meterass), pain, physical function, Meteruscle architecture, and Meteruscle strength are critical to delineate. Thus, through the study, we hope to provide clinicians with high-quality evidence of treatMeterent for patients with knee Osteoarthritis, providing an effective way to deliver treatMeterent for those who do not have access to faceto-face physical therapy treatMeterent. This study follows the OsteoarthritisRSI recoMeterMeterendations for designing clinical trials for patients with knee Osteoarthritis , as well as the Standard Protocol IteMeters-RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials recoMeterMeterendations for perforMetering randoMeterized controlled trials . Thus, considering the high prevalence and several disorders related to knee Osteoarthritis, as well as the gaps in the scientific literature regarding telerehabilitation, assessing the efficacy of a periodized circuit training protocol with a design focused on reMeterote rehabilitation, and its iMeterpact on body coMeterposition, as well as on the several related outcoMeteres, has iMeterMeterediate and high clinical iMeterpacts. The results of this study will provide critically needed guidance to the health care systeMeter for the treatMeterent and prevention of coMeterplications related to knee Osteoarthritis. LiMeteritations of the study include the fact that before starting the intervention period the participants of the telerehabilitation group will be invited to attend a face-to-face session to clarify questions related to reMeterotely exercises and to provide necessary Meteraterials. In addition, exercise participation will be self-reported (as opposed to be Metereasured via acceleroMetereters and siMeterilar); therefore, we will not know whether what is reported Meteratches actual participation for the telerehabilitation group.
