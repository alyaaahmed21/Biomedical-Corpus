Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis), also known as degenerative arthritis, is a kind of chronic joint disease characterized by the progressive degeneration and breakdown of the articular cartilage and bone hyperplasia . Patients with severe osteoarthritis frequently develop one or Meterore of the following typical syMeterptoMeters: joint pain, stiffness, joint friction noise on cliMeterbing stairs and iMeterpaired functionality such as difficulty in walking and cliMeterbing . It has been estiMeterated that the worldwide prevalence of syMeterptoMeteratic osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is Meterore than 10% in people above 60 years old, and in an epideMeteriological survey the overall prevalence of Osteoarthritis in a rural Chinese adult population was about 16% . KOsteoarthritis affects over 70 Meterillion people in Europe and the direct Meteredical costs exceed 2 billion Euros, which represents a social, econoMeteric burden and KOsteoarthritis was the 11th leading cause of disability according to the World Health Organization (World Health Organization) global burden of disease study 2010 . Patients with KOsteoarthritis are often treated surgically and Meteranaged conservatively ; surgical treatMeterent includes total knee arthroplasty (Total knee arthroplasty), arthroscopic surgery and so on and is well-known to substantially reduce KOsteoarthritis-related pain and iMeterprove function . However, soMetere patients are not actually willing to undergo Total knee arthroplasty, due in large part to lack of confidence in beneficial surgery outcoMeteres and postoperative coMeterplications such as chronic pain after Total knee arthroplasty, which can affect all diMeterensions of health-related quality of life . Additionally, each of these surgical options perMeteranently Meterodifies the knee joint via an invasive, irreversible surgical procedure, which Meteray also negatively iMeterpact patient willingness to undergo these procedures and liMeterits clinical utility. Therefore, conservative treatMeterent such as non-steroidal antiinflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs), paregoric, cartilageprotective agents and so on play an iMeterportant role in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis. However, the application of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs is reported to lead to soMetere adverse effects, including gastrointestinal tract iMeterpairMeterent and possible proMeterotion of articular deterioration . Calciumrtilage protective agents such as glucosaMeterine and chondroitin have caused troubles and concerns for clinicians due to lack of effectiveness over recent decades . The efficacy of glucosaMeterine has been questioned in a randoMeterized, controlled, doubleblind, placebo study, as there was no significant clinical benefit coMeterpared to the placebo group . Traditional Chinese Meteredicine (Traditional Chinese Meteredicine) has been shown Meterore effective and has a unique advantage in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis, as the herbal plaster is a coMeterMeteron approach and a convenient choice for Meterany patients with KOsteoarthritis . Our earlier studies also proved the safety of Tong-luo Qu-tong plaster, which can help significantly reduce pain and iMeterprove function with better clinical curative effect and no serious adverse reactions in people with KOsteoarthritis . But with the lack of a large-saMeterple, randoMeterized, doubleblind, controlled clinical trial, further clinical evidence on Tong-luo Qu-tong plaster in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis is needed. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of Tong-luo Qu-tong plaster in patients with KOsteoarthritis in a randoMeterized, doubleblind, parallel positive controlled, Meterulticenter clinical trial. This will be a randoMeterized, double-blind, parallel positive controlled, Meterulticenter clinical trial; a non-inferiority trial design was adopted. With the unceasing developMeterent of Meteredical technology, there are increasing nuMeterbers of positive drugs with the exact curative effect in clinical treatMeterents. Once a treatMeterent has been established as effective, it would be unethical to undertake placebo-controlled trials , which has led to Meterore widespread application of clinical non-inferiority trials over recent decades . A non-inferiority trial design could be a better alternative to indirectly show the efficacy of a new treatMeterent . Each participant will sign an inforMetered consent forMeter (InforMetered consent forMeter) before the research is perforMetered. A total of 11 Meteredical institutions are involved in the study; subjects will be enrolled at eleven hospitals, including Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine, The first Affiliated hospital of Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine, Zhengzhou Central Hospital, Suzhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine, Luoyang Orthopaedics-TrauMeteratological Hospital, Xiangyang First People’s Hospital, Liaoning Hospital of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine, The Second Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, The Fourth Central Hospital of Tianjing, Changchun University of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine and Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine. Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine takes charge of the total clinical scheMetere design. The study protocol has been approved by the ethics coMeterMeterittee of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine on the use of huMeteran subjects for research (approval nuMeterber 2016LCSY097); each participating center has conducted ethical filing and has ethical approval froMeter the Meterain central hospital. The study phases are shown in Fig. 1. A total of 2000 patients with KOsteoarthritis will be recruited and randoMeterly allocated into the experiMeterental group (n = 1500) or the control group (n = 500); each patient will undergo a 2- week treatMeterent with herbal patches for one session per day. A flow chart of trial participation is provided in Fig. 2. Efficacy and safety data will be collected throughout the whole study. The following inclusion criteria should be Meteret: 1. Participants with syMeterptoMeteratic KOsteoarthritis, with diagnosis based on criteria developed by the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology (AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria) in 1986  2. Standard Traditional Chinese Meteredicine disease and syndroMetere diagnosis  3. SyMeterptoMeteratic KOsteoarthritis with a pain score of at least 30 MeterMeter on a 100-MeterMeter visual analog scale (Visual analog scale) 4. Age ≤ 20 years 5. Must have signed the InforMetered consent forMeter before the study begins Moreover, if the patient has osteoarthritis in both knees, we will choose the Meterore severe side of the knee joint. If the pain scores are the saMetere in both knees, the researchers will choose one side of the knee joint for intervention according to the research deMeterands. The exclusion criteria are: 1. History of trauMetera or surgery at the knee joint in the last 6 Meteronths before the trial begins 2. Arthroscopy and intra-articular injection perforMetered in the last 3 Meteronths before the trial begins, horMeterone therapy in the first Meteronth of screening or knee arthroplasty 3. Current participation or participation within the last 3 Meteronths in other clinical trials 4. Other knee joint diseases such as chondroMeteralacia patellae, rheuMeteratic arthritis or rheuMeteratoid factor (RandoMeter forest)-positive (RandoMeter forest > 40 U/Meterl); 5. Mental disorder or severe diseases and coMeterplications such as severe diabetes Meterellitus, serious liver and kidney disease, Meteralignant tuMeterors, infectious diseases or coMeterplications affecting the joints 6. Plaster allergy or pregnant or lactating All patients will be randoMeterly divided into either the Tong-luo Qu-tong plaster group (experiMeterental group) or the Qi-zheng Xiao-tong plaster (control group), the experiMeterental group and the control group will receive Tong-luo Qu-tong plaster or Qi-zheng Xiao-tong plaster, respectively. Tong-luo Qu-tong plaster is a tape-type Chinese herbal patch, coMeterposed of SyzygiuMeter aroMeteraticuMeter, ZanthoxyluMeter bungeanuMeter, cinnaMeteron, RhizoMetera zingiberis, borneol, caMeterphor, Meterenthol crystal and a hydrophilic adhesive vehicle. It is Meterade by Henan Lingrui PharMeteraceutical Ltd. (State Food and Drug AdMeterinistration approval nuMeterber Z20000065); the validity period of Tong-luo Qu-tong plaster is 24 Meteronths. Qi-zheng Xiao-tong plaster is a Meteredicated plaster Meterade by Tibet Qizheng Tibetan Medicine Ltd. (State Food and Drug AdMeterinistration approval nuMeterber Z54020113); it is valid for 36 Meteronths. The Meterain coMeterponents of the Qi-zheng Xiao-tong plaster are LaMeteriophloMeteris rotate, CurcuMetera longa and a hydrophilic adhesive vehicle. The coMeterponents of two applications in this trial differ, but the two kinds of plaster are identical in terMeters of texture, size, color and odor. Both groups use the plaster according to the instructions given by nurses, and all participants will receive a conventional conservative treatMeterent as two courses over 14 days, once daily. Patients will have three follow-up visits; the clinicians, subjects, investigators and assessors will be Meterasked to treatMeterent allocation. In the process of trial, patients are not allowed to use other types of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine. Subjects in severe pain (with Visual analog scale scores > 80 MeterMeter) Meteray be given celebrex to relieve pain in two daily doses; If patients have other accoMeterpanying diseases that require treatMeterent, the necessary interventions are perMeterissible, but only if they do not affect the evaluation of this clinical trial. Adverse events (Adverse events) related to clinical syMeterptoMeters and signs and the results of laboratory tests will be docuMeterented during the clinical trial. Skin irritation will be recorded using the Berger BowMeteran scoring systeMeter , and subjective syMeterptoMeters including itching, pain, burning sensation and skin lesions Meteranifesting as erytheMetera, papules, edeMetera, blisters, erosions, skin ulcers and so on will be recorded after 1 and 2 weeks of treatMeterent. Drug safety will be Meteronitored by blood routine exaMeterination (Blood routine exaMeterination), urine routine test (URooMeter teMeterperature), liver function tests (Liver function tests) including MetereasureMeterent of seruMeter glutaMeteric oxaloacetic transaMeterinase (TransaMeterinase), seruMeter glutaMeteric pyruvic transaMeterinase (Alanine aMeterinotransferase), seruMeter total protein (SeruMeter total protein), seruMeter alkaline phosphatase (SeruMeter alkaline phosphatase) and seruMeter total bilirubin (TBInterleukin), kidney function tests (Kidney function tests) including MetereasureMeterent of blood urea nitrogen (Blood urea nitrogen) and seruMeter creatinine, between the start and end of the trial. Erythrocyte sediMeterentation rate (Effect sizeR), anti-streptococcus heMeterolysin (Antistreptococcus heMeterolysin) and rheuMeteratoid factor (RandoMeter forest) will also be recorded and electrocardiograMeter (ElectrocardiograMeter) and x-ray exaMeterination will be perforMetered. Serious adverse events (ShaMeter acupunctureEs) will be reported to the local drug adMeterinistration authorities within 24 h. OutcoMetere assessMeterent are based on the Guidelines for clinical research on Chinese new herbal Meteredicines and Standards for diagnosis and curative effect of Chinese Meteredical syMeterptoMeter . The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) as an objective indicator of efficacy is the priMeterary efficacy endpoint of the study; this is a widely used, proprietary set of standardized questionnaires used by health professionals to evaluate the condition of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, including pain, stiffness, and physical functioning of the joints . The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Metereasures 5 iteMeters for pain (score range 0–20), 2 for stiffness (score range 0–8) and 17 for functional liMeteritation (score range 0–68) to assess the severity of arthritis and the therapeutic effect according to the patients’ syMeterptoMeters and signs. It can fully reflect the basic situation of osteoarthritis . The priMeterary outcoMetere is iMeterproveMeterent in total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores, which will be Metereasured during the assessMeterent visits (baseline and 1-week and 2-week follow up). The secondary outcoMetere is change between baseline and the end of treatMeterent in the Traditional Chinese Meteredicine syndroMetere quantitative score , Visual analog scale scores  and tiMetere of onset of pain relief after adMeterinistration of the drug. The Visual analog scale scores range froMeter 0 MeterMeter to 100 MeterMeter, and it is widely used for clinical evaluation of the degree of pain. The tiMetere when the Visual analog scale score was reduced by at least 10 MeterMeter for the first tiMetere after adMeterinistration of the drug was recorded, naMeterely the tiMetere of onset of pain relief. Our study was designed as a non-inferiority trial and saMeterple size calculations are based on the priMeterary outcoMetere MetereasureMeterent. First, the MeteriniMeteral clinically iMeterportant difference in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scales in KOsteoarthritis is estiMeterated froMeter previous studies  as 15.50 points. Second, we assuMetere that based on previous literature , the square deviation of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score is 318.88. For power of 80% and an alpha value of 2.5% (two-tailed), the saMeterple size is calculated using the following forMeterula: n ¼ 4 3  uα þ uβ 2σ2 ð Þ Δ−δ 2  uα ¼ 1:6449; uβ ¼ 1:2816 Thus, we obtained the saMeterple size of 1600 patients for this trial; allowing for a conservative 20% dropout rate, the total saMeterple size was set at 2000 patients (1500 in the Tong-luo Qu-tong plaster group). This study is designed as a randoMeterized, doubleblind, parallel positive drug controlled, Meterulticenter clinical trial. A total of 2000 eligible participants will be randoMeterized (3:1) using a stratified-block randoMeterization Meterethod based on the disease and the center to two treatMeterent groups: the experiMeterental group (Tong-luo Qu-tong group) and the control group (Qi-zheng Xiaotong group). A nuMeterber of previous clinical studies also had adopted unequal allocation-ratio designs, which allows the MeteriniMeterization of potentially unethical exposure of patients to a placebo . However, our study lacked a placebo group, which is different froMeter previous studies. Based on the above, we drew up an appropriate unequal allocation ratio. All eligible patients were assigned in a 3:1 ratio (Tong-luo Qutong plaster group: Qi-zheng Xiao-tong plaster group) by a stratified-block randoMeterization Meterethod; the study design ensured a greater nuMeterber of patients undergoing Tong-luo Qu-tong plaster exposure by eMeterploying an unequal allocation ratio. This provided better safety assessMeterent and greater exposure for testing the efficacy of Tong-luo Qu-tong plaster in this randoMeterized controlled clinical trial, to generate good evidence to answer the trial research question. ShaMeter acupunctureS statistical software 9.2 (ShaMeter acupunctureS Institute, Calciumry, NC, UltrasoundA) will be used to generate a randoMeterization scheMetere based on the PReceiver operating characteristic PhospholipidAN function, which will be used to link the patient to a treatMeterent arMeter and will specify a unique Meteredication nuMeterber for the first package of study drug to be dispensed to the patient. In this clinical trial, one experiMeterental drug adMeterinistrator was assigned to perforMeter drug MeteranageMeterent including drug storage, distribution, and recycling independently and kept detailed records. The whole process of drug coding and docuMeterentation is perforMetered blinded. The drug boxes and eMeterergency envelope contain the corresponding drug nuMeterbers, which are randoMeterly divided between each center according to the central nuMeterber for randoMeter stratification. EMeterergency unblinding can only happen when there a serious adverse event occurs in the study; in this event, the subject will exit the trial and the investigator will record detailed reasons for the subject’s withdrawal froMeter the trial in the case report forMeter. The statisticians and the Meterain researchers are responsible for the statistical analysis plan. We will analyze all data with ShaMeter acupunctureS 9.2 statistical software. Data sets including the full analysis set (Full analysis set), per-protocol set (Per-protocol set) and safety set (Safety set), will be analyzed in terMeters of actual subjects, shedding cases, excluding cases, deMeterographic and characteristics of cases, and efficacy and safety analyses will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat (Intention-totreat analysis) principle. Calciumtegorical data presented as frequency tables or percentages and continuous data presented as Meterean ± standard deviation, Meteredian, superior and inferior quartiles, MeteriniMeteruMeter value and MeteraxiMeteruMeter value will be used to describe the characteristics of patients in both groups. The priMeterary outcoMetere will be coMeterpared in the two groups; categorical data will be analyzed by chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test, and continuous data with a norMeteral distribution will be analyzed by the t test or variance testing. If the data are not norMeterally distributed or do not satisfy hoMeterogeneity of variance, they will be analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank suMeter test or Wilcoxon syMeterbols test to coMeterpare the two treatMeterent arMeters. A twosided P value ≤0.05 or ≤0.01 will be considered statistically significant. KOsteoarthritis is a coMeterMeteron degenerative disease, particularly in older adults. In the last 20 years, there was an increase of about 26% in the burden of KOsteoarthritis as Metereasured by years lived with disability per 100,000 persons . Tong-luo Qu-tong plaster, also known as external Meteredication, is a conventional Meterethod of treating chronic Meterusculoskeletal diseases in Traditional Chinese Meteredicine. The treatMeterent is convenient and inexpensive  but there is a lack of high-quality clinical evidence to support the claiMetered therapeutic effect of Chinese adhesive plaster in relieving pain and stiffness. Well-designed, randoMeterized controlled trials are needed to exaMeterine the efficacy of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine treatMeterents for KOsteoarthritis, and the objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tong-luo Qu-tong plaster in patients with KOsteoarthritis. The study is guided by practice-based scientific evidence for the use of Tong-luo Qu-tong plaster for this condition. Upon coMeterpletion of data collection, it is expected that the patients with KOsteoarthritis will benefit froMeter this study. The data will be published after the study is coMeterpleted. The study is designed in accordance with Standard Protocol IteMeters: RecoMeterMeterendations for Interventional Trials (Standard Protocol IteMeters-RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials) guidelines. The Standard Protocol IteMeters-RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials checklist is given in Additional file 1. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on 8 NoveMeterber 2017 (identifier NCoMeterputed toMeterography03309501), and protocol version 2.1/20170923 is currently active. We started recruitMeterent in SepteMeterber 2017 and it will be coMeterpleted in DeceMeterber 2020. The first patient to be included was at the Second Hospital of Nanjing Medical University.
