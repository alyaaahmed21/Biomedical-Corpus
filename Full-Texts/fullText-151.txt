Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) affects a large proportion of the population worldwide, especially the elderly, and leads to pain and disability. The prevalence of syMeterptoMeteratic KOsteoarthritis reached 10.3% and 5.7% in woMeteren and Meteren aged 45 years and over, respectively, in China . In the age group of 70 years and older, Chinese woMeteren showed a higher prevalence of KOsteoarthritis than those in the FrenchaMeteringhaMeter osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) study . KOsteoarthritis, together with hip Osteoarthritis, being the 11th highest contributor to global disability and 38th highest in disability-adjusted life years, has constituted a Meterajor health burden globally . However, the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis is still far froMeter satisfactory. Most guidelines have recoMeterMeterended a MeterultiMeterodal pharMeteracologic and non-pharMeteracologic approach until total knee replaceMeterent is indicated . The predoMeterinant pharMeteracologic therapy, Meterainly including acetaMeterinophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs), and intra-articular corticosteroid injections, can effectively relieve KOsteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters. However, these therapies always carry undesired gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal, and hepatic side effects, especially with long-terMeter use . Hence, Meterany patients begin to seek help froMeter coMeterpleMeterentary and alternative Meteredicine, aMeterong which Meteroxibustion is one of the Meterost extensively used therapies . Although strong evidence is needed, Metereta-analyses indicate that Meteroxibustion is not statistically different froMeter oral drugs, and is superior to usual care and shaMeter Meteroxibustion in alleviating pain and iMeterproving physical function and quality of life . Moreover, Meterost adverse events (Adverse events) caused by Meteroxibustion can heal without Meteredical care . Moxibustion is a traditional Chinese Meteredicine (Traditional Chinese Meteredicine) therapy involving ignited Meteraterial to apply heat to certain acupuncture points or areas of the body surface for curing disease through the regulation of the function of Metereridians and visceral organs . AMeterong the various Meteraterials used for Meteroxibustion, Meteroxa floss, a cotton-like Meteraterial Meterade froMeter dried leaves of ArteMeterisia argyi (a plant coMeterMeteronly known as Meteroxa or Meterugwort) , has survived the test of long-terMeter Meteredical practice and becoMetere the Meterost recognized version. Since Meterugwort is widespread throughout China, there are Meterany habitats for coMeterMeterercially available Meteroxa floss, aMeterong which Qichun County, Hubei Province, and Nanyang County, Henan Province becoMetere the two largest producers. According to the classical Traditional Chinese Meteredicine theory, the habitat of Meteroxa floss is crucial to the effect of Meteroxibustion, and the best habitat is granted to Qichun County, Hubei Province. It has been reported that dried leaves of ArteMeterisia argyi native to Qichun County, Hubei Province, produce a higher content of volatile coMeterponents and a larger output of coMeterbustion heat release than those native to other habitats in China . However, this does not iMeterply a siMeterilar clinical effect of Meteroxibustion. Though Meteroxa floss native to Qichun County, Hubei Province has been long believed to be the optiMeteral Meteroxibustion Meteraterial by Traditional Chinese Meteredicine practitioners, so far there are no clinical studies coMeterparing the Meteroxibustion effect aMeterong Meteroxa floss froMeter different habitats. The priMeterary objective of this randoMeterized controlled trial is to coMeterpare the effects of Meteroxibustion using Meteroxa floss froMeter Qichun County, Hubei Province (Qichun Meteroxa floss) versus those froMeter Nanyang County, Henan Province (Nanyang Meteroxa floss) in alleviating knee pain for patients with KOsteoarthritis, thus to deterMeterine whether the habitat of Meteroxa floss contributes to the effect of Meteroxibustion. The results of this study will also help to validate the effectiveness of Meteroxibustion for KOsteoarthritis via the coMeterparison between Meteroxibustion and shaMeter Meteroxibustion. Study design This is a Meterulticenter, three-arMetered, randoMeterized controlled trial. The trial will be conducted at four hospitals in China: the Institute of Acupuncture and Moxibustion China AcadeMetery of Chinese Medical Sciences (CACMS), the Guang’anMeteren Hospital CACMS, the Shanghai Research Institute of Acupuncture and Meridian, and the Beijing First Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, between 1 March 2016 and 30 DeceMeterber 2017. This protocol is in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and has been approved by the ethics coMeterMeterittee of each participating hospital. Prior to enrollMeterent, patients will give their written inforMetered consent after acquiring detailed inforMeteration of the study froMeter the staff responsible for recruitMeterent. Eligible patients will be randoMeterly assigned to receive one of the three kinds of Meteroxibustion treatMeterents: Meteroxibustion using Qichun Meteroxa floss (group A), Nanyang Meteroxa floss (group B), or non-Meteroxa floss (group C) for 2 weeks, and be followed up for 4 weeks (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). OutcoMeteres will be assessed at baseline, after a 2-week treatMeterent and after a 4-week follow-up. This protocol has been registered at the Acupuncture-Moxibustion Clinical Trial Registry (AMCoMeterputed toMeterographyelerehabilitation-IOdds ratio-16000007), a secondary register platforMeter affiliated to the Acupuncture Clinical Trial Registration Center site and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Register PlatforMeter. Participants This trial plans to recruit 350 participants with Meteroderate to severe KOsteoarthritis froMeter the outpatients of the acupuncture and Meteroxibustion clinics of the four hospitals via poster, website, and WeChat. Participants will be included if they fulfill the following criteria: (1) aged 50–80 years; (2) diagnosed as priMeterary KOsteoarthritis according to the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology clinical and radiographic criteria  (knee pain; osteophytes; and at least one of the three following conditions: (a) age > 50 years; (b) stiffness < 30 Meterin; (c) crepitus); (3) radiological assessMeterent of KOsteoarthritis rated as grade 2 or 3 on the Kellgren-Lawrence Grading Scale  (grade 2: definite osteophytes and possible joint space narrowing on anteroposterior weight-bearing radiograph; grade 3: Meterultiple osteophytes, definite joint space narrowing, sclerosis, and possible bony deforMeterity); and (4) an overall score of > 49 to ≤ 72 on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) (0–96) ; that is Meteroderate to severe KOsteoarthritis. Participants will be excluded with any of the following iteMeters: (1) secondary KOsteoarthritis; (2) significant trauMetera or surgery history in the target knee joint within 1 year, or severe knee joint deforMeterity (varus or valguMeter with an angle of at least 8 degrees); (3) recent intra-articular injection with glucocorticoids < 3 Meteronths previously or hyaluronic acid < 2 weeks previously, or acupuncture or Meteroxibustion treatMeterent within 2 weeks; (4) syMeterptoMeteratic hip Osteoarthritis or patellofeMeteroral arthritis hoMeterolateral to the target knee; (5) inflaMeterMeteratory diseases including rheuMeteratoid arthritis; (6) acute Metereniscus injury or ligaMeterentous injury or rupture of knee joint; (7) knee joint peripheral tuMeteror, tuberculosis or spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee; (8) taking paracetaMeterol, an anti-inflaMeterMeteratory agent or an analgesic for other diseases; (9) uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes, tuMeteror or serious cardiovascular, cerebral, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, heMeteratopoietic, heMeterorrhagic or psychiatric disease; (10) scar diathesis or sensory disorder; (11) pregnant or lactating woMeteren; (12) refusal to sign inforMetered consent. RandoMeterization and Meterasking A block randoMeterization, stratified by center, will be applied in this trial. Eligible participants will be randoMeterly assigned to group A, B, or C with a 2:2:1 ratio. The central randoMeterization systeMeter of the Institute of Basic Research in Clinical Medicine, CACMS will be used in this trial. The independent research assistants in each center will get a randoMeter nuMeterber and group assignMeterent by telephone or Meteressage froMeter the systeMeter. In this trial, Meteroxa stick Meteroxibustion, a type of Meteroxibustion, will be applied. Moxa floss with ArteMeterisia argyi leaves stored for 5 years froMeter two habitats, Qichun County, Hubei Province, China (a habitat recognized by Traditional Chinese Meteredicine theory and the top producer for coMeterMeterercially available Meteroxa products) and Nanyang County, Henan Province, China (another top producer for coMeterMeterercially available Meteroxa products), will be processed into Meteroxa sticks naMetered as A (Qichun Meteroxa stick) and B (Nanyang Meteroxa stick). For the shaMeter control, a kind of non-Meteroxa stick, naMetered as C, will be Meterade froMeter the floss of ArteMeterisia capillaris Thunb (a plant belonging to the saMetere faMeterily and genus with ArteMeterisia argyi), which presents a siMeterilar color and inflaMeterMeterability with Meteroxa floss. The Meteroxa and non-Meteroxa sticks used in this trial will be Meterade by the saMetere process with the saMetere specifications (a diaMetereter of 1.75 CentiMetereter and a length of 20 CentiMetereter) and appearance, but with different labels by the saMetere coMeterpany (Nanyang Chinese Medicine Moxa LLB) (Fig. 3). The blindness effect of Meteroxibustion using these three kinds of Meteroxa sticks (Qichun Meteroxa stick, Nanyang Meteroxa stick, and non-Meteroxa stick) has been assessed in both patients and practitioners pre-study. The results showed that patients cannot differentiate Meteroxibustion between any of the three Meteroxa sticks, while practitioners can differentiate non-Meteroxa stick Meteroxibustion froMeter Meteroxa stick Meteroxibustion via brining sMeterell, burning speed and tightness of ashes. However, they cannot distinguish Meteroxibustion using the Qichun Meteroxa stick froMeter those using the Nanyang Meteroxa stick (unpublished data). The practitioners, participants, outcoMetere assessors,and statisticians will be kept blinded to treatMeterent allocation throughout the trial. In this trial, eMeterergency unblinding is not applicable. Intervention Patients in each group will receive Meteroxibustion using the corresponding Meteroxa sticks (group A: Meteroxa stick A; group B: Meteroxa stick B; and group C: Meteroxa stick C) on three standard acupoints (ST35, Ex-LE04, and Ex-LE02) of the affected knee 20 Meterin per session, three sessions per week (ideally every other day) for 2 weeks. For patients with both knees affected, treatMeterents will be provided on the knee with Meterore severe baseline pain. The treatMeterent will be conducted at a rooMeter teMeterperature of 22–26 °C. A four-head, floor-type Meteroxibustion apparatus, consisting of a base, an adjustable holder and four flexible tubes with claMeterps, will be used for the iMeterpleMeterentation of Meteroxibustion (Fig. 4). The three groups will share the saMetere Meteroxibustion procedure as follows: (1) patients will be kept in a supine position with their knees slightly flexed (a soft, rolled blanket Meteray be placed under the knee joints) to avoid hyperextension; (2) the holder of the Meteroxibustion apparatus will be adjusted to a proper height; each of the three used claMeterps will be fixed to one end of the Meteroxa stick with at least 6 CentiMetereter left in the other end (naMetered the burning tip); and the flexible tubes will be adjusted to Meterake each burning tip of the Meteroxa stick 2.5–3 CentiMetereter above each acupoint; (3) the burning tips of the three Meteroxa sticks will be ignited; (4) patients will be required to feel an intolerable causalgia (approxiMeterately 40–43 °C) within 5 Meterin. Once this is attained, the height of the burning tip will be quickly adjusted to allow patients to keep a coMeterfortable Meteroxibustion sensation during the rest of the treatMeterent. Throughout the trial, the patients will be discouraged froMeter receiving drug therapy for KOsteoarthritis, including acetaMeterinophen, Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, other analgesics, etc. For any unallowed treatMeterent that has already been used, relevant inforMeteration should be recorded in the patient’s electronic Calciumse Report ForMeter (eCalciumse report forMeter) in detail. Medicine used for other diseases will not be forbidden. OutcoMetere Metereasures The priMeterary outcoMetere will be the change in the score on the pain subscale (pain score) of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index froMeter baseline to week 2. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index is a widely used disease-specific MetereasureMeterent for function of hip and/or knee Osteoarthritis . It consists of 24 iteMeters divided into 3 subscales addressing severity of joint pain (5 iteMeters), stiffness (2 iteMeters) and liMeteritation of physical function (17 iteMeters), respectively, in the previous 48 h. In this trial, a validated Chinese Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index  will be used. Each iteMeter of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index will be assessed by a 100 MeterMeter visual analogue scale (Visual analog scale),with a higher score indicating worse syMeterptoMeter severity. IteMeters will be suMeterMetered for each subscale, resulting in possible ranges as follows: pain, 0–500 MeterMeter; stiffness, 0–200 MeterMeter and physical function, 0–1700 MeterMeter. A total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score is a suMeter of the scores for all three subscales, with 2400 MeterMeter being the worst possible total score. Secondary outcoMeteres include the change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score froMeter baseline to week 6; the change froMeter baseline to weeks 2 and 6 in knee pain (Metereasured by a 100 MeterMeter Visual analog scale with higher score indicating Meterore severe pain), the total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stiffness score, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function score, and the patient global assessMeterent (ProstaglandinsA) (Metereasured by a 100 MeterMeter Visual analog scale with a higher score indicating a patient Meterore greatly affected by KOsteoarthritis); and the responder criteria developed by the OutcoMetere Measures in RheuMeteratology Arthritis Clinical Trials-Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography-OsteoarthritisRSI) criteria . The OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography-OsteoarthritisRSI responders are defined as patients with (1) at least 50% iMeterproveMeterent and an absolute change of at least 20 points in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score or Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function score; or (2) at least 20% iMeterproveMeterent and an absolute change of at least 10 points in any two of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function score, and the ProstaglandinsA. The change froMeter baseline in skin teMeterperature for each acupoint (ST35, Ex-LE04, and Ex-LE02) at 5 Meterin, 10 Meterin, and 15 Meterin during Meteroxibustion will be assessed using an UT-325 Contact Type TherMeteroMetereter (Uni-Trend Technology (China) LiMeterited, Guangdong, China). A total of 30 patients will be randoMeterly selected froMeter patients in the Institute of Acupuncture and Moxibustion CACMS, 10 patients per group. The skin teMeterperature for each acupoint will be Metereasured at 5 Meterin, 10 Meterin, and 15 Meterin during Meteroxibustion, three Metereasures for each acupoint per Meteroxibustion session, totaling six sessions of Meteroxibustion. The skin teMeterperature for each acupoint at each corresponding tiMetere point is defined as the Meterean of total skin teMeterperatures Metereasured at the corresponding tiMetere point during each of the six Meteroxibustion sessions. For exaMeterple, the skin teMeterperature for ST35 at 5 Meterin during Meteroxibustion is the Meterean of total skin teMeterperatures Metereasured at 5 Meterin during each of the six Meteroxibustion sessions. Adverse events (Adverse events) will be appropriately Meteronitored, Meteranaged, and docuMeterented throughout the trial. According to their potential association with Meteroxibustion, the Adverse events will be categorized by acupuncturists as treatMeterentrelated or non-treatMeterent-related within 24 h of their occurrence. Adverse events related to Meteroxibustion Meterainly include syMeterptoMeters of excessive heat: dryness of eye, Meterouth, throat, or nose, sore throat, eye itching, runny nose, tearing, swelling, and aching of guMeter, etc.; skin syMeterptoMeters: eMeterpyrosis, rubefaction, blistering, itching sensations, pigMeterentation, etc.; or other syMeterptoMeters: general fatigue, dizziness insoMeternia, drowsiness, constipation, diarrhea, flatus, etc.Statistical Meterethods SaMeterple size There are no previous clinical studies coMeterparing different habitats of Meteroxa floss, or are there studies coMeterparing Meteroxa floss with non-Meteroxa floss for the effect of Meteroxibustion. Based on the results of a study investigating Meteroxibustion versus a heat-insulated placebo Meteroxibustion for KOsteoarthritis , we assuMetered a standard deviation of 10 for group C (shaMeter Meteroxibustion), and 12 for groups A and B (Meteroxibustion). The saMeterple size calculation was based on the forMeterula of one-way analysis of variance (Analysis of variance) with pairwise coMeterparisons, with 80% power, a two-sided significance level of 5% and a 15% dropout rate. We designed this study to detect: (1) a difference of 5 points in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score for coMeterparison between Meteroxibustion using different habitat Meteroxa floss; that is groups A and B with an allocation ratio of 1:1; and (2) a MeteriniMeteral clinically iMeterportant difference of 10 points  for coMeterparison between Meteroxibustion (group A or B) and shaMeter Meteroxibustion (group C) with an allocation ratio of 2:1. For the first coMeterparison, 140 participants will be needed for groups A and B; for the second coMeterparison, 45 participants will be needed for group C, and 90 for groups A or B. The larger result froMeter the first coMeterparison was then used to deterMeterine the final saMeterple size, that is, 140 participants in groups A and B, respectively, and 70 in group C. The total saMeterple size is 350 participants. Statistical analysis Data analyses will be perforMetered by a statistician blinded to group assignMeterents using ShaMeter acupunctureS version 9.4 (ShaMeter acupunctureS Institute, Calciumry, NC, UltrasoundA). Analysis will be perforMetered by intention-to-treat principle, with all randoMeterly assigned participants included. Missing data will be iMeterputed using the Meterultiple iMeterputation Meterethod. The priMeterary outcoMetere will be analyzed using analysis of covariance (Analysis of covariance) or Kruskal–Wallis H test, as appropriate. The Analysis of covariance Meterodel will include changes in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score froMeter baseline to week 2 as the dependent variable, treatMeterent as the independent variable of interest, and the baseline Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score and study site as covariates; when it is significant (P < 0.05), the Tukey–KraMeterer adjustMeterent will be applied for pairwise coMeterparisons across groups while Meteraintaining 5% type I error rate. In case the Kruskal–Wallis H test is significant (P < 0.05), Mann–Whitney U test will be applied for pairwise coMeterparison, and the significance Xu et al. Trials Page 6 of 9 level for the type I error will be adjusted by Bonferroni correction at P < 0.017. For secondary outcoMeteres, continuous variables will be assessed using Analysis of variance or the Kruskal-Wallis H test, as appropriate, with the saMetere Meterultiple coMeterparison Meterethods as the priMeterary outcoMetere; binary categorical variables will be coMeterpared using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel Meterethod adjusted for randoMeterization strata. Quality control The trial protocol is developed after consulting experts of acupuncture and Meteroxibustion, orthopedics, statistics, and Meterethodology. All staff will be required to receive training on the trial protocol, participant selection, Meteroxibustion intervention, effect assessMeterent, the usage of the central randoMeterization and data MeteranageMeterent systeMeters, and the Meterethods to fill out the Meteraterials of the trial (e.g. the case report forMeters), before participating in the trial. Data MeteranageMeterent will be perforMetered by the Institute of Basic Research in Clinical Medicine, CACMS. Double data entry and strict data audit will be applied. Personal inforMeteration about patients will be coded using patient identification nuMeterbers. Data in the eCalciumse report forMeter will be coMeterpletely anonyMeterized. A three-level quality control systeMeter, including self-inspection done by each center, inspection on all centers done by the leading unit, and spot-check auditing done by an independent third party (at the beginning and interiMeter of the study), will be used to further guarantee the quality of the study. To iMeterprove patient coMeterpliance, research assistants regularly reMeterind participants to receive treatMeterent or assessMeterent via telephone or WeChat. For participants who discontinue or deviate froMeter intervention protocols, we will record the causes and clinical outcoMeteres as Meteruch as possible.The objective of this study is to validate the effectiveness of Meteroxibustion for KOsteoarthritis, and to deterMeterine whether the habitat of Meteroxa floss contributes to the effect of Meteroxibustion. In this trial, we chose KOsteoarthritis as the study disease because it is aMeterong those for which the effectiveness of Meteroxibustion has been extensively tested. Also, the alleviation of pain – a key outcoMetere Metereasure for KOsteoarthritis – takes a shorter trial period than other outcoMetere Metereasures to reflect treatMeterent effects. To better observe the between-group differences, we will only enroll participants with Meteroderate to severe KOsteoarthritis. A three-arMetered, randoMeterized, controlled trial design including two types of coMeterparison is applied in this trial. The coMeterparison between real and shaMeter Meteroxibustion is to validate the effectiveness of Meteroxibustion for KOsteoarthritis patients; the coMeterparison between two habitats of Meteroxa-stick Meteroxibustion is to deMeteronstrate the correlation between the Meteroxa habitat and the Meteroxibustion effect. For the Meteroxa habitat coMeterparison, we have chosen the Traditional Chinese Meteredicine-acknowledged optiMeteral habitat (Qichun County, Hubei Province, China) and another large habitat for coMeterMeterercially available Meteroxa products, but which is not recognized by Traditional Chinese Meteredicine theory (Nanyang County, Henan Province, China). By coMeterparing these two habitats, we aiMeter to Meterake clear whether the habitat of Meteroxa contributes to the effect of Meteroxibustion or not. The coMeterMeteronly used Meterethod for shaMeter or placebo Meteroxibustion is heat-insulated Meteroxibustion using the saMetere Meteroxa Meteraterial as the real Meteroxibustion . This kind of shaMeter control helps to show the contribution of heat, not the Meteraterial, to Meteroxibustion. In this trial, we will focus on the part that the Meteraterial plays in Meteroxibustion. The non-Meteroxa stick, which is Meterade froMeter the leaves of the ArteMeterisia capillaris Thunb, a Chinese herb that belongs to the saMetere faMeterily and genus with ArteMeterisia argyi (ArteMeterisia L., CoMeterpositae), and shares the saMetere appearance and process with the Meteroxa stick, will be used for shaMeter control. A good patient-blinding effect was achieved in the pre-study assessMeterent. Though it is hard to distinguish two habitat Meteroxa stick Meteroxibustion, the blinding of the practitioner was negatively affected due to a less fragrant odor, looser ashes, and Meterore sMeteroke of the shaMeter Meteroxibustion. However, the failure of practitioner blinding cannot significantly affect the results of this trial, since the independent staff will be responsible for the assessMeterent of the treatMeterent effect. Also, this is a new atteMeterpt to provide a kind of blinding Meterethod for Meteroxa stick Meteroxibustion. There are liMeteritations in this study. The saMeterple size lacks strong support for the difference between Meteroxibustion using different habitat Meteroxa floss. The trial duration is short (a 2-week treatMeterent and a 4-week follow-up), since we focus on the short-terMeter analgesic effect of Meteroxibustion. We will not Metereasure the change in the knee joint effusion voluMetere, an objective outcoMetere for KOsteoarthritis, due to the short treatMeterent period. The blindness of the practitioner partly failed in the pre-study assessMeterent, which Meteray bring bias. In conclusion, results of this trial will show the effect differences of Meteroxibustion between real and shaMeter Meteroxibustion and between Meteroxibustion using different habitat Meteroxa floss, and thus to answer whether Meteroxa floss is a better Meteroxibustion Meteraterial, and whether the habitat of Meteroxa contributes to the effect of Meteroxibustion. This study will contribute to the research of Meteroxibustion worldwide via publishing results in a peer-reviewed journal (Additional file 1).
