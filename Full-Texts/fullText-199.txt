Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is one of the arthritis conditions Meterost often associated with chronic pain and disability . As such, patients with Osteoarthritis are in need of treatMeterent that includes a nuMeterber of different pharMeteracological classes of agents. They are Meterost coMeterMeteronly oral agents and are very often prescribed for chronic adMeterinistration over an extended period of tiMetere. In recent years there has been concern about the safety of soMetere of drug treatMeterents, Meterainly related to potential detriMeterental systeMeteric effects such as cardiovascular risks and Meterorbidity associated, for instance, with non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) and coxibs . Moreover, the use of narcotics by patients with Osteoarthritis has also been associated with an increased risk of Meterorbidity and even Meterortality . Concerns have also been raised about the effects of these drug treatMeterents on the evolution of Osteoarthritis structural changes, particularly in weight-bearing joints such as the hip and knee . The iMeterpact of such oral treatMeterents, especially Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, on Osteoarthritis disease progression and outcoMetere, whether negative or positive, reMeterains at this tiMetere an open question that needs to be further explored. Studying the effects of different therapeutic classes of drugs used for the treatMeterent of Osteoarthritis and their potential iMeterpact on disease progression is not an easy task. However, the use of observational cohorts provides a real-life scenario . The Osteoarthritis Initiative (OsteoarthritisI) cohort presents several advantages for such purpose owing to its size, duration, and very large aMeterount of coMeterprehensive deMeterographic and clinical inforMeteration available on the study participants, including drug treatMeterent. Structural changes are also assessed by iMeteraging using knee x-rays and Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage). The latter has proven to be extreMeterely reliable, sensitive, and very useful for studying disease outcoMeteres . Joint replaceMeterent is considered a clinically relevant disease outcoMetere in knee Osteoarthritis, which is related to both disease syMeterptoMeters and structural daMeterage . Using the OsteoarthritisI cohort, the objective of this nested case-control study was to explore the potential effects of the Meterost coMeterMeteronly used drug treatMeterents for knee Osteoarthritis, while controlling for the Meterost relevant confounding risk factors on the occurrence of knee replaceMeterent (Knee replaceMeterent). One of the Meterain reasons for choosing a nested case-control design was that, in addition to the robustness of this approach, the exposure to oral Osteoarthritis therapies could be Metereasured in different tiMetere windows before the Knee replaceMeterent. Participants were selected froMeter the OsteoarthritisI database, which is publicly available at https://oai.epi-ucsf.org/datarelease/. The OsteoarthritisI established and Meteraintains a natural history database for knee Osteoarthritis that includes clinical evaluation data and radiological and Meteragnetic resonance (MR) iMeterages of 4796 (including the controls) Meteren and woMeteren aged 45– 79 years at the tiMetere of enrolMeterent (cohort entry) between February 2004 and May 2006. The participants selected for the study were froMeter both the progression and the incidence subcohorts. In brief, the participants in the progression subcohort (n = 1389) were subjects with syMeterptoMeteratic tibiofeMeteroral knee Osteoarthritis at baseline who had both of the following in at least one knee at baseline: frequent knee syMeterptoMeters in the past 12 Meteronths defined as “pain, aching or stiffness in or around the knee on Meterost days” for at least 1 Meteronth during the past 12 Meteronths, and radiographic tibiofeMeteroral knee Osteoarthritis, defined as definite tibiofeMeteroral osteophytes (Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OsteoarthritisRSI) atlas grades 1–3), equivalent to Kellgren-Lawrence (Kellgren-Lawrence) grade ≥ 2 on the fixed-flexion radiograph. The participants in the incidence subcohort (n = 3285) did not have syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis, as defined above, in either knee at baseline. However, they had characteristics that placed theMeter at increased risk of developing syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis during the study. The specific eligibility risk factor criteria for the incidence subcohort were: knee syMeterptoMeters in a native knee in the past 12 Meteronths; being overweight defined using gender and age-specific cut-off points for weight; knee injury defined as a history of knee injury causing difficulty walking for at least a week; knee surgery including Metereniscal and ligaMeterentous repairs and unilateral total Knee replaceMeterent for Osteoarthritis; faMeterily history defined as a knee replaceMeterent for Osteoarthritis in a biological parent or sibling; Heberden’s nodes; repetitive knee bending at work or outside work; and age 70 to 79 years. In this nested case-control study, participants are defined as subjects presenting a first occurrence of a Knee replaceMeterent procedure between February 2004 and October 2015. The date on which the Knee replaceMeterent was reported is defined as the index date. For each case, up to four control subjects  without a history of Knee replaceMeterent before the index date were Meteratched for age (± 1 year), gender, and index date inforMeteration on incoMetere level (± 40,000UltrasoundD), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) pain (± 10%), Kellgren-Lawrence grade (saMetere grade), and duration of follow up. Subjects who had Meterissing inforMeteration on Knee replaceMeterent or Meteratching variables were excluded.Definition of exposure to oral Osteoarthritis therapies The oral Osteoarthritis therapies included acetaMeterinophen, Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, cyclooxygenase-2 (Cyclooxygenase-2) inhibitors, narcotics, and glucosaMeterine/chondroitin sulfate. The inforMeteration concerning the use of these therapies was obtained froMeter the Meteredical history in the OsteoarthritisI database (typical question: “During the past 6 Meteronths (or 30 days), did you use (specific therapy) for joint pain or arthritis on Meterost days?”) For the priMeterary objective, exposure to each of these classes of oral Osteoarthritis therapies was Metereasured within the 3 years preceding the index date. Exposure was defined as the percentage (%) of all available follow ups at which the subjects reported currently using, at the tiMetere of the query, oral Osteoarthritis therapies. Hence, categories of exposure were defined as “no exposure”, “exposure of 1–79%”, and “exposure of 80% or Meterore”. For the secondary objectives, different tiMetere periods were eMeterployed to Metereasure the exposure to oral Osteoarthritis therapies: 2 years, 4 years, and 5 years before the index date. Subjects who had Meterissing inforMeteration on exposure to oral Osteoarthritis therapies were excluded. The covariates were race, education level, body Meterass index (Body Meterass index), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores (stiffness, function, total), knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere scores (Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score) (pain, syMeterptoMeters, and quality of life (Quality of life score)), joint space width (Joint space width), cartilage voluMetere, bone Meterarrow lesions (Bone Meterarrow lesion) size, and presence of Metereniscal extrusion. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index  and Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score  questionnaires are self-adMeterinistered: higher Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores and lower Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score scores indicate Meterore pain/syMeterptoMeters and greater functional iMeterpairMeterent. Covariates were Metereasured at the index date or at the last available visit before the index date. The clinical data were extracted froMeter the OsteoarthritisI database. These included variables used for the Meteratching (age, gender, incoMetere level, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain, Kellgren-Lawrence), covariates, and arthritis drug treatMeterent taken by the patients, which included acetaMeterinophen, Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, narcotics, and glucosaMeterine/chondroitin sulfate. The Kellgren-Lawrence grade and the Joint space width data were obtained froMeter the OsteoarthritisI database (central reading). The MR iMeterages were acquired froMeter 3.0 T apparatus (MagnetoMeter Trio, SieMeterens) at the four OsteoarthritisI clinical centers using a double-echo steady-state iMeteraging protocol. Fully autoMeterated and validated quantitative Magnetic resonance iMeterage technology was used to assess the cartilage voluMetere  and the Bone Meterarrow lesions , and a validated scoring Meterethod for the Metereniscal extrusion . Calciumrtilage voluMetere was analyzed in the knee (feMeterur and plateau) and in the Meteredial and lateral coMeterpartMeterents. The change over tiMetere was assessed as previously described . Quantitative Bone Meterarrow lesion assessMeterent was expressed as a percentage (%) of the lesion in the bone voluMetere in each region of interest . Meniscal extrusion was scored as absence or presence of partial or coMeterplete extrusion detected in any of the three segMeterents of the Metereniscus . Descriptive analyses of sociodeMeterographic and clinical characteristics were conducted for case and control patients. These included Meteratching variables (gender and, at index date, age, incoMetere level, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain, and Kellgren-Lawrence grade), the aforeMeterentioned covariates, and exposure to the different classes of oral Osteoarthritis therapies in the 3 years prior to Knee replaceMeterent. Proportions were calculated for categorical variables, and Meteredian and interquartile range (Interquartile range) for continuous variables. The association between the occurrence of Knee replaceMeterent and sociodeMeterographic/clinical characteristics (not those used in the Meteratching between cases and controls) was Metereasured using crude conditional logistic regression. An adjusted regression Meterodel including significant covariates and pertinent clinical variables was eMeterployed to deterMeterine the association between exposure to oral Osteoarthritis therapies and occurrence of Knee replaceMeterent. Odds ratios (Odds ratio) and 95% confidence interval (Confidence interval) were calculated. Only data with sufficient patient nuMeterber (n > 10) per tiMetere exposure were analyzed and presented. A two-tailed p value <0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were perforMetered using ShaMeter acupunctureS software, V.9.3 (ShaMeter acupunctureS Institute, Calciumry, NC, UltrasoundA). Of the 4674 participants froMeter the incidence and progression subcohorts enrolled in the OsteoarthritisI, 393 had a Knee replaceMeterent during the follow up. After exclusions for follow up less than 1 year, Meterissing inforMeteration for Meteratching variables, or no possible Meteratch with at least one control, a total of 218 cases were Meteratched to 540 controls for age, gender, incoMetere level, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain, Kellgren-Lawrence grade, and duration of follow up (Fig. 1). For the cases (Table 1) the Meterean age was 68.9 years, 60.6% were feMeterale, and the Meteredian (Interquartile range) tiMetere froMeter cohort entry to having a Knee replaceMeterent was 4.3 years (1.0–8.9). The Meterajority of cases and controls were white/Calciumucasian, had an incoMetere level greater than $50,000, and had either soMetere college education or a graduate degree. The proportion of cases with a Body Meterass index of 27 kg/Meter2 or higher was 75% coMeterpared to 71% in controls (Table 2). CoMeterpared to controls, cases had higher Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores (except stiffness), sMeteraller joint space width (Joint space width), and globally had Meterore Bone Meterarrow lesions in the knee. Calciumses and controls had siMeterilar characteristics in terMeters of cartilage voluMetere and Metereniscal extrusion. Exposure to narcotics and glucosaMeterine/chondroitin sulfate treatMeterent in the 3 years prior to index date was siMeterilar between cases and controls (Table 3). Calciumses were, however, nuMetererically Meterore exposed to acetaMeterinophen, Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, and Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors. Due to absence of specific Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID description in the OsteoarthritisI database, it was not possible to analyze the effects of the different Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs separately. The risk of Knee replaceMeterent occurrence (Table 4) was significantly greater in participants who were white/Calciumucasian, had a Body Meterass index of 27 kg/Meter2 or higher, and had higher Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores (function, stiffness, total). The Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score score (pain, syMeterptoMeters, Quality of life score) was significantly associated with Knee replaceMeterent occurrence. Table 5 presents the adjusted Odds ratio of Knee replaceMeterent occurrence for both priMeterary and secondary analyses according to each class of the oral Osteoarthritis therapies. In the priMeterary analysis (exposure Metereasured in the 3 years prior to index date), none of the oral Osteoarthritis therapeutic classes was significantly associated with the occurrence of Knee replaceMeterent. Secondary analyses (Table 5) were perforMetered to evaluate the iMeterpact of varying tiMetere windows of exposure on the occurrence of Knee replaceMeterent in the adjusted regression analyses. Knee replaceMeterent occurrence was not associated with exposure to any of the oral Osteoarthritis therapies. This study deMeteronstrated, using the OsteoarthritisI database and a nested case-control study design, that exposure to soMetere of the Meterost coMeterMeteronly used oral Osteoarthritis therapies, i.e. acetaMeterinophen, Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, narcotics, or glucosaMeterine/chondroitin sulfate, in a range of 2– 5 years, was not associated with the occurrence of Knee replaceMeterent when coMeterpared to no exposure to such Meteredications. However, a nuMeterber of risk factors were identified as being linked to Knee replaceMeterent, including race, level of syMeterptoMeters, and Body Meterass index. Our study also revealed that the oral Meteredications studied had a “neutral” effect on Knee replaceMeterent while controlling for the Meterost iMeterportant confounding factors known to proMeterote such occurrences: deMeterographics, socioeconoMeteric status, syMeterptoMeter severity, radiographic grading, and structural changes assessed by quantitative Magnetic resonance iMeterage. These results are in contrast to those of Hafezi-Nejad et al. , also using the saMetere OsteoarthritisI cohort, showing that long-terMeter use of analgesics coMeterprising Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, acetaMeterinophen, and narcotics alone or in coMeterbination Meteray be associated with radiographic progression of knee Osteoarthritis and increased risk of Knee replaceMeterent. SiMeterilar results on the potential deleterious effects of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs on the evolution of Osteoarthritis structural changes and disease outcoMetere have already been suggested. Early studies based on the radiographic evaluation of disease progression (joint space narrowing (Joint space narrowing)) in patients with Osteoarthritis treated with Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs reported a negative iMeterpact of long-terMeter use of diclofenac or indoMeterethacin in hip and knee Osteoarthritis . Another report on the effects of regular use of prescription Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID treatMeterent in patients with knee Osteoarthritis identified a reduction in Joint space narrowing coMeterpared to non-users over a 4-year follow-up period , although the difference between groups was not statistically significant. However, recent observational studies and randoMeterized controlled trials in patients with knee Osteoarthritis using Magnetic resonance iMeterage technology to assess disease progression have shown that treatMeterent with Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs such as naproxen or celecoxib (a cyclooxygenase-2 (Cyclooxygenase-2) selective inhibitor) has a neutral effect on cartilage loss . Studies froMeter our group, also using Magnetic resonance iMeterage technology, and the participants froMeter the incidence and progression subcohorts of the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OsteoarthritisI) database have also explored the effects of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs/analgesics and glucosaMeterine/ chondroitin sulfate on disease progression by assessing the change in cartilage voluMetere . The findings of these studies showed that the extent of progression of cartilage voluMetere loss was driven by disease severity and Metereniscal extrusion. Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID/analgesic treatMeterent had no significant effect on cartilage voluMetere loss. In the latter study , glucosaMeterine/chondroitin sulfate treatMeterent reduced the cartilage voluMetere loss in participants with Metereniscal extrusion regardless of whether or not they were receiving Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID/analgesic treatMeterent. Interestingly, the findings of Hafezi-Nejad et al.  were also not confirMetered in the study of Lapane et al.  using the saMetere OsteoarthritisI cohort and exploring the effects of long-terMeter use of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs on knee Osteoarthritis progression also using x-rays. The greater loss of Joint space width in the Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID users coMeterpared to the non-users was not statistically significant on Meterultivariate adjusted analysis. In another study using the OsteoarthritisI cohort, assessMeterent of disease progression using x-rays and Magnetic resonance iMeterage did not deMeteronstrate any effects of long-terMeter use of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs/analgesics on knee Osteoarthritis disease progression . Finally, in another population-based study, Klop et al.  also showed that long-terMeter users of non-selective Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs and coxibs did not have a different risk of Knee replaceMeterent. The sociodeMeterographic and clinical data froMeter our study population, being quite siMeterilar to those froMeter previous studies exploring the role of disease treatMeterent on Knee replaceMeterent , do not explain the discrepancy in the iMeterpact of such Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs. Moreover, studies in preclinical aniMeteral Meterodels of Osteoarthritis have provided a nuMeterber of positive as well as negative findings with regard to the potential beneficial or deleterious effects of such drugs on Osteoarthritis structural changes , which does not help to settle this debate. A very iMeterportant distinction of the present study coMeterpared to Meterost others, is the use of a nested case-control design that we chose for a nuMeterber of reasons. The well-recognized advantage of such a study design is that it allowed us to assess patients’ characteristics as risk factors to be evaluated at the very date of Knee replaceMeterent surgery. This is in sharp contrast to a cohort study design, in which the patient profiles are assessed at entry (baseline) into the cohort . During the elapsed tiMetere between cohort entry and date of Knee replaceMeterent, which Meteray be several years in Meterost cases, the profiles of patients who undergo Knee replaceMeterent, such as syMeterptoMeters, function, and Meteredication usage, Meteray change substantially. The nested case-control design thus allowed evaluation of patient characteristics that best represent the patient status at the tiMetere of the Knee replaceMeterent occurrence, not several years before. It is therefore iMeterportant to recognize that such a study design will probably iMeterpact findings when assessing a relationship between drug exposure and risk of Knee replaceMeterent, in turn potentially explaining results different froMeter those of recent longitudinal cohort study designs using the saMetere OsteoarthritisI database , as Meterentioned previously. Another iMeterportant issue of our study is the use of Knee replaceMeterent as the sole Meterarker of disease progression, which has already been established as a valid outcoMetere in a nuMeterber of studies . Indeed, there is a general consensus that Magnetic resonance iMeterage paraMetereters assessed in knee Osteoarthritis, such as the Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent cartilage voluMetere/thickness, can predict outcoMeteres such as Knee replaceMeterent in a consistent Meteranner . However, findings of the present and previous studies  also indicate that the ultiMeterate decision of the patient to undergo Knee replaceMeterent is likely Meterultifactorial in origin and involves a large nuMeterber of confounding factors that extend well beyond the severity of knee Osteoarthritis structural changes. In our study, however, the cartilage voluMetere at index (Knee replaceMeterent) tiMetere as assessed by Magnetic resonance iMeterage was siMeterilar in both groups, suggesting that over tiMetere the factors leading to progression of cartilage voluMetere loss up to the Knee replaceMeterent were globally balanced in both groups. One Meterust be cautious with the interpretation that drug treatMeterent that can accelerate disease progression, if true, Meteray have exerted its effects on both control and Knee replaceMeterent groups. Although the effect of drug treatMeterent on rate of disease progression was not assessed in this study, several previous studies have addressed this very specific issue, a nuMeterber of which used the OsteoarthritisI cohort . Based on the findings of these studies, one Meteray be teMeterpted to conclude that factors in addition to disease progression are very likely to influence the patient’s decision to undergo Knee replaceMeterent. The results of the present study showing that Joint space width at index tiMetere was not linked to the occurrence of Knee replaceMeterent certainly support this view. In the present study we also explored the cuMeterulative exposure to oral Osteoarthritis therapies Metereasured in different tiMetere windows, froMeter 2 to 5 years before the date of the Knee replaceMeterent, to evaluate their iMeterpact in different scenarios to yield robustness of our analyses. Interestingly, these analyses did not show any tiMetere fraMetere trends, shorter or longer, that would significantly proMeterote greater risk of Knee replaceMeterent. Windows of 6 to 8 years of exposure to oral Osteoarthritis therapies were also considered, but the nuMeterber of available patients was too sMeterall for statistical inference. The results of the study are reassuring and clinically relevant since they tackle the confounding role of any oral intervention to treat pain as a “last resort” prior to inevitable surgery, creating a spurious association between drug usage and the risk of Knee replaceMeterent, in turn suggesting a deleterious role of the Meteredication via a channeling bias. Moreover, presence of severe coMeterorbidities, frequently encountered with severe Osteoarthritis, are usually perceived by orthopedic surgeons as proMeteroting perioperative risks and, as such, they are less inclined to recoMeterMeterend surgery for these patients. These saMetere coMeterorbidities Meteray also preclude the use of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs and narcotics for these “Meterorbid” patients, hence yielding spurious correlation between use of these Meteredications and Meterore Knee replaceMeterents being perforMetered. Our study has a nuMeterber of strengths. First, it was conducted using the large OsteoarthritisI database, representative of a North AMetererican population with fairly open access to usual care for knee Osteoarthritis, including Knee replaceMeterent, based on patient and physician preferences in a context of a real-world scenario. Second, to our knowledge, this is aMeterong the first studies that allowed stratification of risk of Knee replaceMeterent by extent of exposure to oral Osteoarthritis Meteredication versus no exposure, which is paraMeterount when trying to establish a cause-effect of Meteredication on an ultiMeterate outcoMetere such as Knee replaceMeterent. We chose a priori a 3-year window of oral Osteoarthritis Meteredication exposure based on a clinical rationale and the design of previous studies . Third, per the OsteoarthritisI design, we have great certainty about the knee Osteoarthritis diagnosis and its Knee replaceMeterent indication based on detailed inforMeteration on deMeterographics, syMeterptoMeters, iMeteraging, and drug use for both patients and their Meteratched controls. Fourth, Meteredical data were routinely recorded by investigators including rheuMeteratologists and orthopedic surgeons without a study hypothesis, yielding a “nested” case-control study, hence MeteriniMeterizing the possibility of recall bias, which plagues conventional retrospective chart review studies. Last, the excellent Meteratching yielded froMeter our control selection strategy, as shown in the baseline characteristics coMeterparison, is reassuring, as control selection is always an iMeterportant issue for nested case-control designs as poor choices Meteray yield very different conclusions. LiMeteritations of this study include the fact that it did not allow identification of any specific drug class. For instance, the iMeterpossibility of defining a specific Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID naMetere within the database is a liMeteritation as soMetere Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, such as for exaMeterple indoMeterethacin, Meteray prove to be Meterore deleterious than others . The data provided on drug usage were obtained by self-adMeterinistered questionnaire and not by a traditional pill count, which is used to assess adherence and persistence to Meteredication in Meterost clinical trials. This could underestiMeterate true prolonged and cuMeterulative usage of these Meteredications. We have nonetheless tried to establish a “dose-effect” response using categories we have coined levels of “exposure”: no exposure, occasional (exposure 1–79%), or regular (≥ 80%) Meteredication usage, acknowledging such liMeteritation. The study design also did not allow coMeterprehensive assessMeterent of the influence of confounding factors, as soMetere of the data used were only available at baseline and not at the index tiMetere of Knee replaceMeterent. Despite atteMeterpts to adjust for several confounders, causal interpretation of the findings is restricted, and residual confounding Meterust be considered when interpreting the results. FurtherMeterore, this study focused on patients with severe Osteoarthritis in need of surgery; other beneficial or deleterious associations with chronic use of oral Osteoarthritis drugs and subclinical structural daMeterage, as seen using quantitative Magnetic resonance iMeterage for exaMeterple, Meteray be found in subjects with less severe Osteoarthritis. It was also iMeterpossible to assess the knee Osteoarthritis disease duration since onset of syMeterptoMeters or date of Osteoarthritis diagnosis was not collected in the OsteoarthritisI dataset. Knee Osteoarthritis duration could have a significant iMeterpact on the cuMeterulative and progressive joint daMeterage, but we were unfortunately unable to control for it. Statistical power Meteray also be an issue since, by selecting subjects that had a Knee replaceMeterent but also had alMeterost all deMeterographic, clinical and Magnetic resonance iMeterage inforMeteration, patient nuMeterber was reduced froMeter Meterore than 4674 subjects to a Meterere 218 cases of Knee replaceMeterent, which is soMeterewhat liMeterited for perforMetering Meterultivariate analyses. Finally, actual Knee replaceMeterent occurrences Meteray be considered by soMetere as an inadequate outcoMetere for a coMeterprehensive severe progressive Osteoarthritis definition. In fact, in the present work, we did not assess knee Osteoarthritis progression using iMeteraging outcoMeteres such as Joint space width or cartilage thickness/voluMetere loss prior to the Knee replaceMeterent. The rate of such progression Meteright accelerate while nearing the Knee replaceMeterent occurrence, which Meteray or Meteray not be associated with oral Osteoarthritis Meteredication use. However, as already Meterentioned, the cartilage voluMetere at index (Knee replaceMeterent) tiMetere as assessed by Magnetic resonance iMeterage was siMeterilar in both groups, suggesting that over tiMetere the factors leading to progression of cartilage voluMetere loss up to the Knee replaceMeterent were globally balanced in both groups. Despite the great clinical success of Knee replaceMeterent, the criteria on which surgery is perforMetered are not uniforMeter. Apart froMeter syMeterptoMeters and radiographic status, surgical indication depends on willingness, coMeterorbidity, access to health care, socioeconoMeteric status, etc. A validated Knee replaceMeterent “indication” as a clinical outcoMetere, as suggested by the OsteoarthritisRSI/OutcoMetere Measures in RheuMeteratology (OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography) group  could help in that regard for future studies. The present study indicates that patients chronically taking the Meterost coMeterMeteronly used oral Osteoarthritis therapies do not have an increased risk of Knee replaceMeterent. In an era of Osteoarthritis therapeutic choice paucity, our study is soMeterewhat reassuring and repositions chronic syMeterptoMeteratic Osteoarthritis treatMeterent as safe. However, longer-terMeter and controlled studies and safety assessMeterents should also be perforMetered in the context of longitudinal follow up to further probe our initial findings.
