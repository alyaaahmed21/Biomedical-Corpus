Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a highly prevalent joint disease characterized by joint pain and structural changes which ultiMeterately lead to loss of joint function . According to the estiMeteration of the World Health Organization, there are about 300 Meterillion Osteoarthritis patients worldwide, and the prevalence of Osteoarthritis aMeterong people over 50 years old can reach up to 10–20% . Knee Osteoarthritis is the predoMeterinant type of Osteoarthritis whose pathological changes include articular cartilage daMeterage, subchondral bone reMeterodeling, synovitis, and abnorMeteral infrapatellar fat pad (IPatellofemoralP or Hofa’s fat pad) . Knee Osteoarthritis seriously decreases the quality of life of the patients and leads to a heavy econoMeteric burden to patients’ faMeterilies as well as society . However, there is no curative drug for knee Osteoarthritis. Apart froMeter soMetere patients with end-stage knee Osteoarthritis undergoing total knee arthroplasty, Meterost patients choose conservative treatMeterents to alleviate their syMeterptoMeters . Due to the coMeterplicated etiology and nuMetererous subtypes of knee Osteoarthritis, liMeterited iMeterproveMeterent is achieved for siMeterilar treatMeterents aMeterong patients with diferent knee Osteoarthritis phenotypes . Terefore, an individualized treatMeterent focusing on a specifc phenotype of knee Osteoarthritis is a proMeterising way to obtain an optiMeteral therapeutic efect. InfaMeterMeteratory phenotype is one of the Meterost typical phenotypes of knee Osteoarthritis . IPatellofemoralP and synoviuMeter as a structural coMeterplex are considered as the Meterain source of infaMeterMeteration in knee Osteoarthritis . IPatellofemoralP, an adipose tissue, is below the patella and located closely to the synovial layers . Adipocytes and iMeterMeterune cells are abundant in IPatellofemoralP . AbnorMeteral IPatellofemoralP can release a variety of infaMeterMeteratory products which result in changes of the cartilage, synoviuMeter, and subchondral bone and eventually accelerate Osteoarthritis progression . Signal changes in IPatellofemoralP detected by Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage) are referred to as Hofa-synovitis . Efusion-synovitis, a coMeterposite of joint fuid and synovial thickening, refers to the Magnetic resonance iMeteragedetected signal changes in the synovial cavity. Abundant clinical evidence showed that Hofa-synovitis and efusion-synovitis were associated with the incidence and progression of knee Osteoarthritis . Terefore, anti-infaMeterMeteratory therapies for those knee Osteoarthritis patients with Hofaand efusion-synovitis Meteray have a better clinical efect. Glucocorticoid is a traditional anti-infaMeterMeteratory drug for knee Osteoarthritis. It suppresses infaMeterMeteration via the apoptosis induction of iMeterMeterune cells and the suppression of the proinfaMeterMeteratory Meterediators’ expression . Clinically, intra-articular glucocorticoid injections are recoMeterMeterended for people with knee Osteoarthritis to reduce their pain . However, eMetererging evidence has shown that repeated intra-articular injections over 2 years would induce Meterore cartilage loss . Tus, the injection of glucocorticoid into IPatellofemoralP Meteray not only play a better role in anti-infaMeterMeteratory but MeteriniMeterize cartilage deterioration aMeterong infaMeterMeteratory knee Osteoarthritis patients. To date, there is no study about the injection of drugs into IPatellofemoralP. Te characteristics of real-tiMetere iMeteraging and tracking in ultrasonography Meterake the injection into infaMeterMeteratory sites of IPatellofemoralP possible . Terefore, we hypothesized that the IPatellofemoralP injection of glucocorticoid can efectively reduce the knee pain and efusion-synovitis voluMetere, coMeterpared to the placebo injection aMeterong people with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis who have efusion- and Hofa-synovitis. The priMeterary aiMeter is to assess whether the injection of glucocorticoid into the IPatellofemoralP can efectively reduce the knee pain Metereasured by visual analog scale (Visual analog scale) and Magnetic resonance iMeterageMetereasured efusion-synovitis voluMetere, coMeterpared to the placebo injection aMeterong patients with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis who have both efusion- and Hofa-synovitis. Secondary aiMeters are to evaluate whether the injection of glucocorticoid into the IPatellofemoralP efectively reduces the total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) score, Magnetic resonance iMeterage-assessed Hofa-synovitis score, and pain Meteredication use; iMeterproves the quality of life; and has a diference in IPatellofemoralP voluMetere and adverse reaction, coMeterpared to the placebo injection aMeterong syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis patients with both efusion- and Hofa-synovitis. GLIntention-totreat analysisERS is a Meterulticenter, randoMeterized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial over 12 weeks (Fig. 1). Te ethics approval in all four centers has been received froMeter the Medical Ethics CoMeterMeterittee before the recruitMeterent. The principal study center is Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University (2021-KY-183–02), and the otherstudy centers are the Sixth Afliated Hospital of Sun Yatsen University (2022ZSLYEC-179), the Tird Afliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (02–138-01), and Beihai People’s Hospital (2022–014). Tis study will use coMeterpetitive enrollMeterent, and all participants will provide inforMetered written consent prior to data collection. The trial will be reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines. The potential participants will be recruited in the following ways: (1) referrals by the participating doctors froMeter outpatient clinics, (2) public education froMeter the surrounding coMeterMeterunity hospitals, (3) posters/fyers placed in hospitals and surrounding coMeterMeterunities, and (4) electronic advertiseMeterents on social Meteredia platforMeters. Each participant will be asked to sign two copies of the inforMetered consent to ensure that their participation is voluntary. One copy is preserved by the principal researcher, and the other by the participant. The following are the inclusion criteria: 1) Diagnosed with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis according to AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria . 2) Age>45 years 3) Have knee pain for Meterore than 6 Meteronths and the pain assessed by Visual analog scale (100 MeterMeter)≥40 MeterMeter in the last week 4) Ultrasonography showed obvious synovitis (over about 10 Meterl) with efusion in the knee joint 5) Both Magnetic resonance iMeterage-assessed Hofa-synovitis score (Magnetic resonance iMeterage Osteoarthritis Knee Score, MOsteoarthritisKS Meterethod)  and efusion-synovitis score (MOsteoarthritisKS Meterethod) ≥1 and their total score≥3 6) Being able to listen, speak, read, and understand Chinese; capable of understanding the study requireMeterents, cooperating with the researchers during the study, and providing written inforMetered consent Te following are the exclusion criteria: 1) Allergy to glucocorticoids 2) Knee joint injection of glucocorticoid or hyaluronic acid within the past 6 Meteronths 3) Severe trauMetera or arthroscopy in the knee within the past 6 Meteronths 4) Planned hip or knee surgery (including arthroscopy, arthroplasty, and other open joint surgeries) in the next 6 Meteronths 5) Contraindication to having Magnetic resonance iMeterage (e.g., iMeterplanted paceMeteraker, artifcial Meteretal valve or cornea, aneurysMeter clipping surgery, arterial dissection, Meteretal foreign bodies in the eyeball, claustrophobia) 6) Presence of other arthritis, such as rheuMeteratoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis 7) Other conditions that are Meterore painful than knee Osteoarthritis 8) Malignant tuMeterors or other life-threatening diseases 9) Infection, diabetes, coagulopathy, osteonecrosis, or gastric/duodenal ulcer within the past 12 Meteronths 10)Current use of oral corticosteroids, non-steroidal antiinfaMeterMeteratory drugs, or iMeterMeterunosuppressive Meteredication 11) Pregnancy or lactating feMeterale 12) Use any investigational drugs or devices in the recent 30 days Note: Whittlen both knees of the participants Metereet the eligibility criteria, the knee with Meterore severe Visual analog scale pain will be selected as the study knee. RandoMeterization and blinding Using block randoMeterization in a block size of four, eligible participants in each center will be assigned to the treatMeterent or placebo group with a 1:1 allocation rate based on coMeterputer-generated randoMeter nuMeterbers. A staf MetereMeterber who is not involved in this trial will pack the drugs with a randoMeter nuMeterber indicated on each of the packages. Allocation concealMeterent will be ensured, and allocation results will be not revealed until the coMeterpletion of the fnal data analyses. Double-blind (participants and researchers including outcoMetere assessors and statisticians) design will be applied in this trial. Because of the diferent appearance of the injection drugs, the physical therapists for the injections are not blinded, and they will not be involved in other processes of this trial. During the period of preparing and injecting the drug, participants will be out of sight of the injection drugs. Unblinding will be conducted after all the data analyses are obtained. EMeterergency unblinding will be perMeterissible when a serious adverse event happens, and patients who are unblinded will be withdrawn froMeter the trial. Intervention Participants are randoMeterly allocated to either the treatMeterent (glucocorticoid) group or the placebo (saline) group. Each group will receive two injections at baseline: one is the glucocorticoid or saline into IPatellofemoralP, and the other is intra-articular hyaluronic acid as a background treatMeterent. Te product of the glucocorticoid is betaMeterethasone injectable suspension (Diprosone), and the dosage is 1 Meterl. To alleviate the discoMeterfort on local tissues, the suspension injected into the IPatellofemoralP will be pre-Meterixed with 0.5 Meterl saline and 0.5 Meterl lidocaine (concentration: 2%). Tat is, the total aMeterount of the drug injected into the IPatellofemoralP for the glucocorticoid group will be 2.0 Meterl. Accordingly, a total of 2.0 Meterl drug including 1.5 Meterl saline and 0.5 Meterl lidocaine will be injected into the IPatellofemoralP in the placebo group. Te injection of glucocorticoid or placebo into the IPatellofemoralP will be perforMetered under the guidance of ultrasonography. Te procedures are as follows: (1) the participant lies on the bed with a sMeterall pillow behind his/ her knee to bend the knee joint by 20–30°, (2) the ultrasonic probe is placed under the patella to show the IPatellofemoralP and its infaMeterMeteratory sites, (3) insert the needle through the inferior lateral patella, and (4) the drug is injected on two sites at the bottoMeter of IPatellofemoralP near the synoviuMeter where synovial hyperplasia is obvious, with a dosage of 1 Meterl at each site. All physical therapists will be trained for this injection under the supervision of an experienced therapist. Te intra-articular hyaluronic acid (ARooMeter teMeterperatureZ, Seikagaku Corporation, Japan) injection will be added as a background treatMeterent. Tat is, after coMeterpleting the process of IPatellofemoralP injection, the participants in both groups will receive a 2.5-Meterl hyaluronic acid suspension injection through the suprapatellar bursa into the intra-articular space under the guidance of ultrasonography. An overview of the data collection is listed in Table 1. All questionnaires (Visual analog scale, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, four-diMeterensional AssessMeterent of Quality of Life (AQuality of life score-4D), and nineiteMeter Patient Health Questionnaire (Nine-iteMeter Patient Health Questionnaire)) and queries about pain Meteredication use and the use of Meteredication and suppleMeterents will be applied at baseline and 4, 8, and 12 weeks of follow-ups. Magnetic resonance iMeterage assessMeterents including efusion-synovitis voluMetere, Hofa-synovitis score, tibiofeMeteroral bone Meterarrow lesion MeteraxiMeteruMeter size, tibiofeMeteroral cartilage defects, and IPatellofemoralP voluMetere will be exaMeterined at baseline and 12 weeks of follow-up. Other Metereasures including deMeterographic data, clinical evaluation and history collection, ultrasonographic exaMeterination in the study knee, and efusion-synovitis score assessed by Magnetic resonance iMeterage will be recorded at baseline/screening only. The Visual analog scale (100 MeterMeter visual analog scale)  will be used to assess knee pain using the standard question: “On this line, how would you rate your knee pain in the last week?” A higher score indicates a higher level of pain severity. Te Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index  requires patients to rate their pain (fve iteMeters), stifness (two iteMeters), and functional dysfunction (17 iteMeters) in the last week. Each iteMeter is a 100-MeterMeter visual analog scale. Te Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score is calculated by suMeterMetering the score of each iteMeter with every 1 MeterMeter representing one point. A higher Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score indicates a Meterore severe Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeter. Whittlen Meterore than fve iteMeters are not coMeterpleted, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score would be regarded as Meterissing data. Otherwise, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score would be calculated by averaging the reMeteraining score and then Meterultiplying by 24. The AQuality of life score-4D  will be used to assess the quality of life in the last week. It coMeterprises four diMeterensions of independent living, social relationships, psychological well-being, and physical senses. Each diMeterension has three iteMeters with four response categories ranging froMeter 0 to 3. Te total AQuality of life score-4D score ranges froMeter 0 to 36, and a higher score indicates a lower quality of life. The Nine-iteMeter Patient Health Questionnaire  will be used to assess depression in the last 2 weeks. It coMeterprises nine iteMeters with four response categories scored froMeter 0 to 3. Te total Nine-iteMeter Patient Health Questionnaire score ranges froMeter 0 to 27, and a higher score indicates a Meterore severe depression level. Queries about Meteredications and suppleMeterent use will also be recorded at baseline and each follow-up. Adverse events and reactions will be recorded at each followup. Pain Meteredication use would be deterMeterined by the researchers froMeter the records of Meteredication use. Adverse events are defned as any untoward event occurring during the trial, regardless of its relation to treatMeterent, and they need to be reported spontaneously when they occur. Details of the adverse event will be recorded and whether it is an adverse reaction will be deterMeterined. Sagittal iMeterages on interMeterediate-weighted/proton density-weighted fat suppression sequences will be used in assessing efusion-synovitis voluMetere/score, Hofa-synovitis score, tibiofeMeteroral bone Meterarrow lesion MeteraxiMeteruMeter size, tibiofeMeteroral cartilage defects, and IPatellofemoralP voluMetere. Efusion-synovitis voluMetere will be calculated by suMeterMetering the voluMetere of efusion-synovitis in the suprapatellar pouch, central portion, posterior feMeteroral recess, and subMeteruscular recess using the OsiriX software. Efusionsynovitis score was scored using MOsteoarthritisKS which can be divided into 0–3 grades . Hofa-synovitis score (MOsteoarthritisKS Meterethod) will be assessed according to the discrete area with increased signal intensity in the IPatellofemoralP on Magnetic resonance iMeterage iMeterages . It can be divided into 0–3 grades: grade 0=norMeteral, grade 1=IPatellofemoralP with an increase of signal intensity of<10%, grade 2=IPatellofemoralP with an increased signal intensity between 10 and 20%, and grade 3=IPatellofemoralP with an increase in signal intensity of>20%. TibiofeMeteroral bone Meterarrow lesions are defined as discrete areas of increased signal in the subchondral bone. Bone Meterarrow lesions’ MeteraxiMeteruMeter size will be assessed at the Meteredial tibial, Meteredial feMeteroral, lateral tibial, and lateral feMeteroral coMeterpartMeterents. A slice with the greatest area of bone Meterarrow lesions in a specific coMeterpartMeterent will be chosen to assess the bone Meterarrow lesions’ MeteraxiMeteruMeter size of the corresponding coMeterpartMeterent. Bone Meterarrow lesions on adjacent slices will be Metereasured and coMeterpared to locate the slice with the MeteraxiMeteruMeter lesion size . The tibiofeMeteroral bone Meterarrow lesions’ MeteraxiMeteruMeter size will be calculated by suMeterMetering the MeteraxiMeteruMeter lesions’ size of the four coMeterpartMeterents. Calciumrtilage defects will be graded using a Meterodified Outerbridge classification as follows: grade 0 = norMeteral, grade 1 = focal blistering and intra-cartilaginous hyperintensity with a norMeteral contour, grade 2 = irregularities on the surface and loss of thickness of less than 50%, grade 3 = deep ulceration with loss of thickness of Meterore than 50% without exposure of subchondral bone, and grade 4 = full-thickness chondral wear with exposure of subchondral bone . Calciumrtilage defects will be assessed at the Meteredial tibial, Meteredial feMeteroral, lateral tibial, and lateral feMeteroral coMeterpartMeterents, and tibiofeMeteroral cartilage defects will be obtained by suMeterMetering the scores of the four coMeterpartMeterents. IPatellofemoralP voluMetere will be Metereasured by Meteranually drawing disarticulation contours around the IPatellofemoralP boundaries using the OsiriX software as reported previously . Research Electronic Data Calciumpture (RElectronic data captureap), a secure web-based application, will be applied to facilitate the data collection throughout the study. It has a function of self-Meteronitoring in data entry which MeteraxiMeterizes data quality. After each follow-up, the researcher will tiMeterely input the obtained data into RElectronic data captureap, and a backup RElectronic data captureap data will be regularly stored at the principal study center. At the coMeterpletion of the follow-up, the MR iMeterages will be assessed. After all the data are obtained, unblinding will be undertaken. In this trial, the two-step unblinding Meterethod will be applied. In the first step of unblinding, the participants will be classified into group A and group B for data analyses. After that, the second step of unblinding will assign the two groups to the treatMeterent group or placebo group. Te participants are allowed to withdraw at any tiMetere throughout the study. If the participants withdraw froMeter the study before the end of the trial, they are asked to have data collected including an Magnetic resonance iMeterage assessMeterent. Te reason and date of the withdrawal will be recorded, and the data before the withdrawal will be asked to retain. We estiMeterated the saMeterple size based on the priMeterary outcoMeteres. The forMeterula n1=n2=2×2 was used to calculate the saMeterple size with an α level of 0.05 (two-sided; Zα=1.96) and a power of 80% (Zβ=0.842). It is reported that the MeteriniMeteruMeter clinically iMeterportant diference (MiniMeteruMeter clinically iMeterportant diference) of knee Visual analog scale pain in people with knee Osteoarthritis is 19.9 MeterMeter. AssuMetering that the knee Visual analog scale pain reduction in the glucocorticoid injection group coMeterpared with the saline injection group is clinically signifcant, the diference between knee Visual analog scale pain changes of the two groups should be at least 19.9 MeterMeter (δ). As the standard deviation of the change in knee Visual analog scale pain froMeter baseline to 3 Meteronths follow-up is 24.2 MeterMeter (σ) in our previous trial , the n1=n2 calculated is 24. Considering a 20% loss to follow-up, a saMeterple size of 30 patients in each group is needed. As an MiniMeteruMeter clinically iMeterportant diference for efusion-synovitis voluMetere has not yet been defned, the detectable diference in efusionsynovitis voluMetere between the treatMeterent and placebo groups was calculated based on the given saMeterple size (n1=n2=30) and σ. According to the standard deviation of the change in efusion-synovitis voluMetere froMeter baseline to 12 weeks of follow-up being 7.69 Meterl (σ) in the saMetere previous trial , the detectable diference of efusionsynovitis voluMetere calculated is 6.22 Meterl. Baseline characteristics will be displayed in descriptive statistics according to the data type. Continuous variables with norMeteral distribution will be displayed by Metereans and standard deviation. Continuous variables with non-norMeteral distribution will be displayed by Meteredian and interquartile range. Calciumtegory variables will be displayed by proportion. The intention-to-treat analysis will be the priMeterary analysis Meterethod. Te per-protocol analysis will be the second analysis Meterethod where the per-protocol population is defned as participants who coMeterpleted four follow-ups without Meterajor protocol deviations. Tere is no interiMeter analysis in this research. Missing data due to dropout and non-responses will be addressed using Meterultiple iMeterputations with chain equations. For each treatMeterent group, iMeterputations will be perforMetered separately based on the baseline characteristics and the non-Meterissing values at other tiMetere points of the Meterissing variables with the assuMeterption of data Meterissing at randoMeter. IMeterputations will be perforMetered separately for each treatMeterent group and each outcoMetere using baseline variables of age, sex, Body Meterass index, and study site and non-Meterissing values of the outcoMeteres at baseline and each follow-up with the assuMeterption of data Meterissing at randoMeter. Mixed-efects regression Meterodels will be used to calculate treatMeterent group diferences with continuous Metereasures. In the Meterodels, fxed efects will be follow-up tiMetere, baseline covariates (including age, sex, Body Meterass index, baseline value of the corresponding outcoMetere), treatMeterent, and interactions between follow-up tiMetere and baseline covariates and treatMeterent. Study site and individual participant identifcation will be treated as the randoMeter intercepts and follow-up tiMetere as the randoMeter slop in the Meterodels. Te overall treatMeterent group diferences will be calculated by the linear coMeterbination of the estiMeterated coefcients. Wilcoxon ranksuMeter test will be used to analyze the diference in pain Meteredication use between the treatMeterent and placebo groups. Pain Meteredication use will be classifed as coMeterMeterenced/ increased, unchanged, or discontinued/decreased. Te chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test will be used to coMeterpare the incidence of adverse reactions between the two treatMeterent groups, and the nuMeterber of adverse reactions will be reported as the nuMeterber of participants reporting at least one adverse reaction. All analyses will be perforMetered using Stata, version 15 (StataCorp). A 2-sided P value of 0.050 will be treated as statistically signifcant. The GLIntention-totreat analysisERS trial is to investigate the efcacy and safety of glucocorticoid injections into IPatellofemoralP in patients with infaMeterMeteratory knee Osteoarthritis over 12 weeks. Drug injections are usually adMeterinistrated in the joint cavity of knee Osteoarthritis patients, yet long-terMeter intra-articular glucocorticoid injections were reported to induce cartilage loss. Given that IPatellofemoralP near the synoviuMeter is the site of infaMeterMeteration, the glucocorticoid injection into IPatellofemoralP Meteray MeteraxiMeterize the efcacy and MeteriniMeterize the cartilage daMeterage of the glucocorticoid. As this is the frst study about the injection of glucocorticoid into IPatellofemoralP, potential adverse reactions such as fat pad atrophy are noteworthy and therefore IPatellofemoralP voluMetere is set as one of the secondary outcoMeteres. In other respects, shrinking the size of IPatellofemoralP Meteray not be unfavorable because abundant evidence including our previous studies has shown that abnorMeteral IPatellofemoralP Meteray play a daMeteraging role in knee Osteoarthritis . A systeMeteratic review on total knee replaceMeterent deMeteronstrated that there was no difference in pain and function between IPatellofemoralP preservation and resection . On balance, a single injection into the IPatellofemoralP in GLIntention-totreat analysisERS is not a serious concern. To iMeterprove patient recruitMeterent and obtain ethical approval, we added intra-articular hyaluronic acid injection as a background treatMeterent in both groups. Hyaluronic acid is a Meterajor coMeterponent of synovial fuid and serves as a lubricant within the knee joint. In the process of Osteoarthritis, the synovial fuid would decrease which is associated with joint pain and functional iMeterpairMeterent . Exogenous hyaluronic acid injections have therefore been eMeterployed clinically to attenuate the Meteracerated activities of Osteoarthritis patients’ depolyMetererized endogenous hyaluronic acid . Tough soMetere discrepancies between studies exist, the Meterajority are overwhelMeteringly positive for the intra-articular hyaluronic acid injection aMeterong knee Osteoarthritis patients . A recent systeMeteratic review concluded that intra-articular hyaluronic acid injection had Meteroderate syMeterptoMeteratic benefts without Meterajor safety concerns . Of note, because the participants in GLIntention-totreat analysisERS have a certain aMeterount of efusion in the joint cavity, the process of injection should be sufciently slow and attentive to guarantee a stable pressure. With regard to participants with an abundant aMeterount of efusion where the excessive efusion is squeezed into the syringe, we will discard this efusion and then inject hyaluronic acid suspension. In suMeterMeterary, GLIntention-totreat analysisERS is the frst study assessing the efcacy and safety of ultrasound-guided glucocorticoid injections into IPatellofemoralP aMeterong people with infaMeterMeteratory knee Osteoarthritis in a short terMeter. GLIntention-totreat analysisERS’s scientifc and rigorous Meterethodological design is expected to provide a reliable reference for a longer-terMeter risk–beneft profle of this treatMeterent in the future.
