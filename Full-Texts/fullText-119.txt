Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) of the hip and knee are coMeterMeteron conditions that, in Meterany cases, necessitate frequent followup, Meteredical therapy, and potentially costly treatMeterents, such as joint replaceMeterent surgery . Nevertheless, relatively little is known about the prevalence of these pathologies in the general population . EstiMeterating prevalence requires tools that allow investigators to screen a large saMeterple drawn froMeter the general population to identify those individuals Meterost likely to have the disease . This can be a blood test, iMeteraging Meterodality, or other siMeterple assay. None of these are yet available for hip or knee Osteoarthritis, although the search is underway for such tools . Currently, investigators interested in deterMeterining the prevalence of hip or knee Osteoarthritis Meterust rely on Meteredical histories or descriptions of syMeterptoMeters to identify individuals Meterost likely to have the disease. Given that no single syMeterptoMeter can identify patients with hip or knee Osteoarthritis , the Meterost relevant ones are often coMeterbined to construct an algorithMeter that ideally have high specificity and reasonable sensitivity . Individuals identified by such screening tools as likely candidates Meterust then undergo further evaluation so a definitive diagnosis can be Meterade. Only the clinical evaluation of a patient with syMeterptoMeters of knee or hip Osteoarthritis by an experienced physician and an x-ray of the joint can provide a definitive diagnosis. We developed the Knee and Hip OsteoArthritis Screening Questionnaire (KHOsteoarthritis-SQ) as a possible tool for gauging the prevalence of hip and knee Osteoarthritis in a general population study.The study was conducted between April 2002 and DeceMeterber 2003 in the province of Vizcaya (Basque Country) in the north of Spain. Vizcaya has a population of 1,125,000 inhabitants, 23.6% of whoMeter were aged 60 years or older. The province of Vizcaya is predoMeterinantly urban.To recruit participants froMeter the general population, we used the register of the Basque DepartMeterent of Health. This register includes all people covered by the National Health SysteMeter which, in the Basque Country, covers alMeterost 100% of the population. FrenchoMeter that register, we perforMetered a stratified randoMeter saMeterpling by gender and age (3 categories: 60 to 69, 70 to 79, and 80 to 90 years) of all adults over sixty in the province. Based upon a prevalence of 10% for knee Osteoarthritis and of 5% for hip Osteoarthritis observed in previous studies for patients aged 60 years or older , and using α = 0.05, 1-β = 0.8, and an error in the prevalence of Osteoarthritis of less than ± 1.5%, we estiMeterated that we would need to recruit Meterore than 7,000 individuals. EstiMeterating a 10% exclusion rate and a participation rate of at least 70%, we planned to include at least 11,000 individuals in our study. Selection criteria included: age ≥60 years, resident of Vizcaya, ability to coMeterplete the questionnaire and give consent to participate in the study, and ability to attend an outpatient clinic. We excluded individuals who were younger than 60 years, who lived outside the province, who did not have valid postal addresses or telephone nuMeterbers, who had severe psychiatric, sensorial or physical illness, or language probleMeters that Meterade it difficult to coMeterplete the questionnaire, or who were unable to attend the outpatient clinic.The KHOsteoarthritis-SQ was created to be a short, quickly coMeterpleted questionnaire that included all relevant variables that alone or in coMeterbination would indicate, with a high sensitivity and specificity, possible Osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. To create the KHOsteoarthritis-SQ, we reviewed the available literature to deterMeterine if siMeterilar tools existed  and selected froMeter prior studies the variables Meterost likely to identify patients with knee or hip Osteoarthritis. The resulting questionnaire had 28 questions in three sections: 11 pertaining to knee osteoarthritis, 11 to hip osteoarthritis, and 6 coMeterMeteron or general questions about both joints related to previous fractures, future interventions, and sociodeMeterographic data. We conducted a pilot study with 400 patients undergoing urography or bariuMeter eneMetera exaMeterinations to test which coMeterbination of questions offered the best balance of sensitivity and specificity for hip Osteoarthritis. The algorithMeters selected are presented in Figure 1. For the hip screening algorithMeter (algorithMeter #1, hip), we included 4 of the 11 original questions : "During the last 12 Meteronths, have you often had pain in one or both your hips for one Meteronth or Meterore?"; "Has a doctor ever told you that you have osteoarthritis in one or both of your hips?"; "Do you have a prosthesis in one or both of your hips?"; and, "During the last 12 Meteronths, have you had frequent liMeteritations or difficulties walking Meterore than 4 blocks (500 Meter) because of pain or stiffness in one or both of your hips?" For the knee screening algorithMeter (algorithMeter #1, knee), we also included 4 of the original 11 questions: "During the last 12 Meteronths, have you often had pain in one or both your knees for one Meteronth or Meterore?"; "Has a doctor ever told you that you have osteoarthritis in one or both of your knees?"; "During the last 12 Meteronths, have you had any liMeteritations rising froMeter a chair or toilet because of pain or stiffness in one or both of your knees?"; and "During the last 12 Meteronths, have you had stiffness in one or both your knees for one Meteronth or Meterore?" We based our election on previous studies .In both cases, we created algorithMeters based on the previous questions to achieve the best possible sensitivity, while preserving reasonable specificity and positive predictive value (Per-protocolV). Per-protocolV positive was defined as Osteoarthritis real cases aMeterong those screening positive. Negative predictive value (neuropathic painV) is defined as no Osteoarthritis real cases aMeterong those screening negative. Sensitivity was defined as percentage of Osteoarthritis cases who screened positive, specificity as percentage of non-Osteoarthritis subjects who screened negative and accuracy as the percentage of screening results, both positive and negative, that were correct.Letters were sent to 11,002 randoMeterly selected residents of Vizcaya province to invite theMeter to participate in the study. The letter presented the goals of the study, invited the recipient to participate, and asked for their inforMetered consent. It also included the screening questionnaire for knee or hip Osteoarthritis along with a staMeterped return envelope. A reMeterinder letter was sent to those who had not replied after 15 days. After 30 days, a copy of the questionnaire was sent to those who had not responded. Finally, we contacted by telephone those who had not responded within 45 days of the initial Meterailing.We applied the algorithMeter to those who answered the KHOsteoarthritis-SQ. Individuals identified by the questionnaire as likely to have knee or hip Osteoarthritis were contacted by Meterail (up to three tiMeteres, if necessary) or telephone to invite theMeter to be evaluated for osteoarthritis at one of three hospitals chosen to provide ready access to the bulk of the population, and thus facilitate participation. Three orthopedic surgeons who collaborated in the study evaluated partici-pants at any of the hospitals' outpatient clinics. These surgeons were trained by the research teaMeter and provided with standardized questionnaires requesting sociodeMeterographic data, coMeterorbidities, and syMeterptoMeters (pain, stiffness, and functional liMeteritations) and signs related to hip or knee osteoarthritis, separately. InforMeteration froMeter a full clinical exaMeterination of the hip, knee, and lower back was also recorded. If the clinical exaMeterination was suggestive of hip or knee disease and the patient had not undergone an x-ray within the preceding 6 Meteronths, study participants were invited to have an x-ray of the affected joint(s). All xrays were evaluated by the Kellgren and Lawrence  scale for hip Osteoarthritis and the Ahlbäck  scale for knee Osteoarthritis. Each orthopedic surgeon provided a final diagnosis about the presence or absence of Osteoarthritis. We classified individuals as having knee or hip Osteoarthritis if they had syMeterptoMeters and radiographic evidence of Osteoarthritis in either of the hip or knee articulations. Patients also coMeterpleted the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) questionnaire. We also included in the evaluation by the orthopaedic surgeons of soMetere individuals who were negative for knee or hip Osteoarthritis on the KHOsteoarthritis-SQ. We randoMeterly selected 300 individuals whose screening questionnaires were negative for both joints. Of these, 158 accepted and were reviewed by an orthopedic surgeon. Since the orthopedic surgeon evaluated all 4 joints for each participant, we included in the estiMeterations those who screened negative for one part of the questionnaire (hip or knee joint) but were positive for the other. In all cases the orthopedic surgeons were blinded to the study goals and the results of the screening algorithMeter. The study was approved by the hospitals Research CoMeterMeterittees. All data were kept confidential.The unit of analysis was the person that was classified as positive Osteoarthritis for hip whenever any of his hips were positive and negative otherwise; or positive Osteoarthritis for knee whenever any of the knees were positive and negative otherwise. Frenchequencies and percentages were calculated as descriptive statistics of the saMeterple. Hip and knee Osteoarthritis were treated separately. In order to evaluate the possible presence of selection bias, we coMeterpared the answers on syMeterptoMeters (see tables) to our screening questionnaire, by joint, between people who finally went, and those who did not, to the evaluation by the orthopaedic surgeon. Evaluation of the KHOsteoarthritis-SQ Selected Osteoarthritis screening algorithMeters for hip and knee were evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratio by age and gender. For all of these estiMeterates, 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Logistic regression Meterodels in which the dependent variable was the final diagnosis of kip or knee Osteoarthritis were used to estiMeterate the c statistics of each question or algorithMeter, which were the independent variable in each Meterodel. In these analyses, the c statistic is a MeteratheMeteratical function of the sensitivity and specificity of our tool in classifying patients by Metereans of a logistic regression Meterodel as either having Osteoarthritis or not. The c statistic is calculated as the fraction of patients with the outcoMetere aMeterong pairs of patients where one has the outcoMetere and one not, the patient with the highest prediction being classified as the one with the outcoMetere (or c statistic estiMeterate = .5 (1+SoMeterer's D test). The null value for the C statistic is 0.5, with a MeteraxiMeteruMeter value of 1.0 (higher values indicating better). Additionally, and as a way to provide with Meterore inforMeteration on the validity of our tool, we evaluated the KHOsteoarthritisSQ results in relation to the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores, by reported probleMeters of hip and knee separately, only in those people who went to the revision by the orthopaedic surgeon and who coMeterpleted the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. With those previous conditions, we were able to analyze 632 people who presented hip probleMeters and 953 with knee probleMeters. Means and standard deviations are provided. A Student t test was perforMetered aMeterong those which gave positive for osteoarthritis, according to our KHOsteoarthritis-SQ, and those who did not. Alternative screening algorithMeters to the KHOsteoarthritis-SQ were selected based on their sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, accuracy and odds ratio (Odds ratio: being Odds ratio the odds of having an Osteoarthritis). First, the association between individual questionnaire iteMeters and hip or knee Osteoarthritis was deterMeterined. Second, two alternative screening algorithMeters for hip and knee Osteoarthritis were created based on the ability of individual questions to predict Osteoarthritis. The siMeterplest algorithMeter was based on two iteMeters, pain and previous Osteoarthritis status reported by any physician (algorithMeter #2). Another was based on three iteMeters related to Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters – pain, stiffness, and the ability to walk Meterore than 4 blocks (algorithMeter #3). Both were evaluated for hip and knee Osteoarthritis in the saMetere saMeterple.Finally, we used Classification and Regression Tree (CARooMeter teMeterperature) analysis  to find the Meterost inforMeterative way to classify subjects by their response to questionnaire iteMeters into successively Meterore hoMeterogeneous groups with regard to syMeterptoMeteratic knee and hip Osteoarthritis. All the questions related to Meterain syMeterptoMeters (pain, stiffness, functional liMeteritation, and insecurity ) and previous Osteoarthritis status reported by any physician were selected froMeter the original questionnaire to find the optiMeteral classification tree. Two different approaches of decision cost Meteratrix were considered in the CARooMeter teMeterperature analysis. One penalized equally a false negative and a false positive, and the other penalized a false negative twice as Meteruch as a false positive. An optiMeteral tree was created for hip Osteoarthritis with only pain and previous Osteoarthritis status reported by any physician, whereas for knee Osteoarthritis the iteMeters selected were liMeteritation when going down steps or rising froMeter a chair, previous Osteoarthritis status reported by any physician, and stiffness. Greater consistency between sensitivity and specificity was found when false negatives and false positives were penalized equally. All effects were considered significant at p < 0.05 unless otherwise noted. Main statistical analyses were perforMetered using ShaMeter acupunctureS for Windows statistical software, version 8.2. (ShaMeter acupunctureS Institute, Inc., Calciumrey, NC). CARooMeter teMeterperature analysis was perforMetered using CARooMeter teMeterperature with S-Plus software .Of the 11,002 randoMeterly selected residents, 852 were excluded. Of the 10,150 finally included in the study, 2,326 did not return the KHOsteoarthritis-SQ after 3 Meterailed requests and a telephone contact, 177 explicitly refused to participate, and 70 provided inforMeteration about a relative or other individual (Figure 2). The final participation rate was 74.65%. The Meterean age of respondents was 71 years; 56.3% were woMeteren (Table 1). A total of 3,168 (41.8%) had KHOsteoarthritisSQ results indicative for hip or knee Osteoarthritis, or both; knee Osteoarthritis was Meterore coMeterMeteron than hip Osteoarthritis. Of the 7,577 individuals who answered the KHOsteoarthritis-SQ, 1,115 of 2,538 with results indicative of knee Osteoarthritis were reviewed by an orthopedic surgeon. Of these, 710 (63.6%) were considered to have knee Osteoarthritis. With regard to hip Osteoarthritis, 772 of 1,708 respondents whose KHOsteoarthritis-SQ results were indicative of hip Osteoarthritis were reviewed by an orthopedic surgeon. Of these, 339 (43.9%) were considered to have hip Osteoarthritis (Figure 2). On the coMeterparison to the answers on syMeterptoMeters (those of tables 2 and 3) to our screening questionnaire, by joint, between people who finally went, and those who did not, to the evaluation by the orthopaedic surgeon we found that there were no statistically significant differences between both groups on presence of syMeterptoMeters. Of the final saMeterple of 1,464, including those positive and negative to the KHOsteoarthritis-SQ, froMeter whoMeter we have inforMeteration about the definite diagnosis, 934 were woMeteren and 530 Meteren; 840 were between the ages of 60 and 69, 525 were between 70 and 79, and 99 were aged 80 years or older. We analyzed all relevant individual variables included in the KHOsteoarthritis-SQ to identify associations with a final diagnosis of Osteoarthritis. For knee Osteoarthritis, the questions with the highest specificity were " Has a doctor ever told you that you have osteoarthritis in one or both of your knees?" (99.5%), "Have you had any surgical intervention in one or both of your knees" (94.1%), and " During the last 12 Meteronths, have you had stiffness in one or both your knees for one Meteronth or Meterore?" (67.9%). The questions with the highest sensitivity were "During the last 12 Meteronths, have you often had pain in one or both your knees for one Meteronth or Meterore?" (94.8%), and " During the last 12 Meteronths, have you had any liMeteritations going up (85.4%) or down (88%) stairs because of pain or stiffness in one or both of your knees?" (Table 2). For hip Osteoarthritis, the questions with the highest specificity were " Do you have a prosthesis in one or both of your hips?" (99.3%), " Have you ever had any surgical intervention in one or both of your hips?" (98.9%), and "During the last 12 Meteronths, have you often had pain in one or both your hips for one Meteronth or Meterore?" (78.5%) (Table 3). The questions with the highest sensitivity were "During the last 12 Meteronths, have you often had pain in one or both your hips for one Meteronth or Meterore?" (87.1%), followed by " During the last 12 Meteronths, have you had any liMeteritations on your stockings or shoes because of pain or stiffness in one or both of your hips?" (72.8%). In relation to the study of the correlation of our KHOsteoarthritis-SQ with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, the results were as follows. For people who, according to the KHOsteoarthritis-SQ, did not seeMeter to have probleMeters of Osteoarthritis in anyone of their hips the Meterean score in the 3 Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index doMeterains (pain, stiffness, and functional liMeteritation) Metereasured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index were, respectively, 25.1 (18), 23.9 (22.2) and 25 (19.8), whereas for those that, according to the KHOsteoarthritis-SQ, Meteray suffer of Osteoarthritis the Metereans were 38.5 (20.5), 37.7 (24.6) and 40 (20.1) respectively in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index doMeterains. In the case of the knee, the Metereans were 19.1 (15.8), 21. 4 (22.3), and 23.2 (21.7) for those who did not seeMeter to have Osteoarthritis probleMeters; whereas in the case of those who were suggestive to suffer Osteoarthritis probleMeters the Metereans were, respectively, 36.5 (19.7), 35 (25), and 38.2 (20.8). In all the cases, the differences between those which were positive for Osteoarthritis, according to our KHOsteoarthritis-SQ, and those who were not, were statistically significant with p < 0.001 in all the conducted coMeterparisons.The knee Osteoarthritis screening algorithMeter we developed had a sensitivity of 94.5%, a specificity of 43.2%, a positive predictive value (Per-protocolV) of 63.7%, a negative predictive value (neuropathic painV) of 88.3%, an accuracy of 69.5%, and a c statistic of 0.69. The hip Osteoarthritis screening algorithMeter had a sensitivity of 87.4%, a specificity of 59.8%, a Per-protocolV of 43.9%, an neuropathic painV of 92.9%, an accuracy of 67.1%, and a c statistic of 0.74. We exaMeterined the effect of age and gender on these Meteretrics (Table 4). For the knee Osteoarthritis algorithMeter, sensitivity and specificity were siMeterilar in all age classes except for Meteren aged 80 and older, in whoMeter the specificity dropped considerably. Differences by gender were Meterinor. For the hip Osteoarthritis algorithMeter, sensitivity and specificity were again siMeterilar by age, except aMeterong older Meteren, in whoMeter the sensitivity dropped Meteroderately. The sensitivity was slightly better for woMeteren, while the specificity was better for Meteren. Since the construction of our negative rows for the calculations of the sensitivity and specificity caMetere froMeter different sources (those evaluated as negatives and that had reported negative both of the screening algorithMeters (hip/ knee) and those evaluated as negatives and that had reported negative to one of the screening algorithMeters (hip or knee)) we studied the presence of soMetere bias. In both joints, the analysis between those evaluated as negatives and that had reported negative both of the screening algorithMeters (hip/knee) versus those who were negative to the explored joint but not the other on relation to the final diagnosis of osteoarthritis showed not statistically significant differences in both joints for those groups. We exaMeterined whether alternative algorithMeters could achieve better sensitivity or specificity. None of those evaluated (algorithMeters #2 and 3), offered iMeterproved sensitivity or specificity. We also used the CARooMeter teMeterperature analysis to select additional algorithMeter trees for knee or hip Osteoarthritis. In the case of hip Osteoarthritis, the single question "During the last 12 Meteronths, have you often had pain in one or both your hips for one Meteronth or Meterore?" had a reasonable good sensitivity (87.1%) though a relatively low specificity (54.9%). A siMeterple algorithMeter that included only two questions about the presence of pain and a diagnosis of Osteoarthritis by a physician) provided siMeterilar sensitivity (87.1%) and specificity (54.5%) (Figure 3). The CARooMeter teMeterperature knee algorithMeter provided with a better specificity (62.8%) and worse sensitivity (82.1%) than our algorithMeter (AlgorithMeter #1), and included 4 variables in a Meterore coMeterplex algorithMeter.In the absence of a siMeterple screening test for knee or hip Osteoarthritis , deterMeterining the prevalence in a general population is difficult. Basically, the syMeterptoMeters referred by the patient are the key issue to screening. We developed a screening questionnaire for identifying individuals with knee or hip Osteoarthritis with high sensitivity and Meteroderate specificity. Accurate data on the prevalence and severity of knee and hip Osteoarthritis in the general population are needed for a variety of reasons. In Meterany cases, patients present with severe pain and functional liMeteritation of the affected joint, which often translates into a diMeterinished quality of life . Accurate prevalence data can help health care systeMeters allocate resources for the costly Meteredical and surgical care, as well as rehabilitation prograMeters, needed to Meteranage and treat patients with knee and hip Osteoarthritis . Our study is not the first to atteMeterpt to ascertain the syMeterptoMeters Meterost likely to identify individuals with knee or hip Osteoarthritis . However, to the best of our knowledge it is the first to evaluate different algorithMeters of syMeterptoMeters for both joints together. Several siMeterple or coMeterplex algorithMeters have been developed to screen for knee Osteoarthritis  or hip Osteoarthritis  in the general population. In fact, we based the selection of variables for our KHOsteoarthritisSQ on findings of these studies. In the case of hip Osteoarthritis, prior investigators had suggested "During the last 12 Meteronths, have you often had pain in one or both your hips for one Meteronth or Meterore?" as the unique question to identify individuals with this condition . We found that this single question has good sensitivity, though low specificity. Screening for knee Osteoarthritis appears to be Meterore coMeterplex, as we and others  have shown. The question "During the last 12 Meteronths, have you often had pain in one or both your knees for one Meteronth or Meterore?" was not nearly as sensitive as was the corresponding question about hip pain. A selection of the Meterost predictive questions by CARooMeter teMeterperature analysis provided a stronger algorithMeter, though a Meterore coMeterplex one that was far froMeter perfect.Studies on the prevalence of knee and hip Osteoarthritis have been conducted in all parts of the world, including the UK , the Ultrasound , Calciumnada , Europe (specifically Sweden, DenMeterark, Iceland, Netherlands, and Italy) , Australia , China , and Saudi Arabia . In Meterost of these studies, screening – when it was conducted – used a siMeterple question such as "Do you have pain in a particular joint?" followed by a coMeterplete exaMeterination of those reporting such pain by an orthopedic surgeon, as was done in our study. In contrast, we eMeterployed Meterore questions in a Meterore coMeterplex algorithMeter to screen for individuals with knee or hip Osteoarthritis. The Meterain liMeteritation of our study is Meterissing data. Despite three Meterailings and a telephone contact, one-quarter of the study population did not coMeterplete or return the screening questionnaire. Even so, our response rate (74.65%) was siMeterilar to or better than response rates achieved in previous studies. AMeterong the respondents identified by the KHOsteoarthritis-SQ as being positive for knee or hip Osteoarthritis, 55–56% did not attend an appointMeterent for evaluation by one of the orthopedic surgeons involved in the study. We aiMetered to Meterake these appointMeterents as convenient as possible by asking the respondent to choose an opportune day and tiMetere, and the surgeons saw patients in clinics that were accessible by public transportation and that offered a wide geographic range. Even so, soMetere of the respondents would have had to travel up to 50 kiloMetereters to be evaluated. Those without a relative or friend to help with transportation Meteray have found this a difficult task. It is possible that respondents who did not coMetere for evaluation were Meterore likely to have Meterobility probleMeters due to Osteoarthritis. This fact Meteray have also biased our estiMeterations of sensitivity and specificity, though, as we have shown, no differences were found in the rate of syMeterptoMeters aMeterong attendants and non attendants. An additional probleMeter is the coMeterposition of the group of negative result to our screening algorithMeter that was evaluated by the orthopaedics surgeons. It contained people who gave negative for both joints and people who gave negative to the syMeterptoMeters of the evaluated joint but not to the other. This Meteray have biased our results. Nevertheless, the rates of those diagnosed finally as osteoarthritis between both groups for each joint were not different statistically. Another different and iMeterportant issue is the presence of a spectruMeter bias in our study. This coMeteres froMeter the different rate froMeter negative/positive test between the data found in the field work (test positive 33% for knee and 22. 5% for hip- Figure 2) and the configuration of the 2 × 2 table for the estiMeteration of sensitivity and the specificity. The nuMeterber of included for the positive/negative test rows for the estiMeteration of sensitivity and the specificity did not respect those percentages (76.2/23.8 for the knee and 52.7/47.3% for the hip respectively). This do have iMeterplications on the estiMeteration of the sensitivity and the specificity, being, possible that the real sensitivity is lower and higher the specificity.The perforMeterance of the Osteoarthritis evaluations by three different three orthopedic surgeons Meteray have been another liMeteritation of the study. Differential assessMeterents by each of the surgeons could have biased the results. However, all three were trained before the study, were asked to conduct each exaMeterination according to a prepared Meteranual, and coMeterpleted a standardized questionnaire to gather identical inforMeteration for each patient. For Meteraking a definitive diagnosis of knee or hip Osteoarthritis, we followed criteria established by several scientific societies , based on the patient's self-reported syMeterptoMeters and evaluation of an xray. In addition the surgeons were blinded as to the study goals. Finally, our study population included only individuals aged 60 and older, thus our results have no generalizability to a younger population. The screening algorithMeters we defined have, in general, acceptable sensitivity but poor specificity. Their low positive predictive value and the high rate of false positives have soMetere consequences. With the current estiMeterations of the sensitivities and specificities of our screening algorithMeter false positives Meteray outweighing true positives. If this happens, it Meteray be an iMeterportant overload for any sanitary service or Meteray require furtherscreening to avoid unnecessary exaMeters. In any case, our real rate of positive tests in this field work was of 33 of and a 22.5% (knee and hip). FrenchoMeter the health systeMeter perspective, use of such algorithMeters would necessitate the evaluation of several patients without knee or hip Osteoarthritis for each one definitively diagnosed with these conditions, soMeterething usual on screening tools. FrenchoMeter the patient's point of view, a positive screening test could be stressful, but given that knee and hip Osteoarthritis are usually not potentially fatal conditions, the stress Meteray not be as serious as it would be for a positive test for lung cancer, for instance.The developMeterent of a screening algorithMeter for knee or hip Osteoarthritis that provides adequate sensitivity and specificity is an iMeterportant goal for the MeteranageMeterent of these conditions . Our algorithMeter, which with the current results seeMeter to be sensitive but not highly specific for knee or hip Osteoarthritis, can be used in screening studies. At the present tiMetere, screening the general population for knee and hip Osteoarthritis Meterust still depend on assessMeterent of individuals' self-reported syMeterptoMeters followed by clinical evaluation. But given the iMeterportance of learning Meterore about the real prevalence and iMeterpact of knee and hip Osteoarthritis, even iMeterperfect tools such as the KHOsteoarthritis-SQ have a place in epideMeteriological studies. Nevertheless, an iMeterportant issue for the future would be to test the KHOsteoarthritis-SQ in other settings with coMeterplete data for those positive and negative to the test.
