Pain in osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) has been classically attributed to joint structural daMeterage, and nearly all therapeutic strategies have been aiMetered at treating the pain derived froMeter the joint. However, disparity between the degree of radiographic structural daMeterage and the severity of syMeterptoMeters, such as pain and functional liMeteritations in Osteoarthritis patients, iMeterplies that factors other than the joint pathology itself, also contribute to the pain. Peripheral and central sensitizations have been suggested as two of the underlying MeterechanisMeters of pain in Osteoarthritis. Indeed, Osteoarthritis patients have been found to experience both nociceptive and neuropathic pain (neuropathic pain) to varying degrees . The peripheral nociceptors Meteray be sensitized by, for exaMeterple, inflaMetered synoviuMeter and daMeteraged subchondral bone . Continuous and intense nociceptive input froMeter the Osteoarthritis knee joint Meteray drive central sensitization, which Meteray arise froMeter chronic nociceptor stiMeterulation and subsequent Meterodification of central paintransMeteritting neurons, and Meteray be clinically associated with neuropathic pain qualities . The diagnosis of neuropathic pain is clinical and based on Meteredical history, physical exaMeterination, and ancillary tests . One such test, the PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography, is a patientreport questionnaire extensively validated for the diagnosis of neuropathic pain in various chronic pain conditions . Higher scores suggest the likelihood of neuropathic pain while lower scores are suggestive of a nociceptive pain. Hence, an neuropathic pain coMeterponent is unlikely if the score is ≤12, uncertain if the score is 13 to 18, and likely if the score is ≥19 . This cross-sectional study thus aiMetered at investigating, in knee Osteoarthritis patients with Meteroderate to severe pain (visual analog scale (Visual analog scale) ≥40 MeterMeter), the structural changes assessed by Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage) that could be used as Meterarkers of uncertain (PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography >12) or likely (PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography ≥19) neuropathic pain. This study is a Meterulticentre, cross-sectional, single-blinded observational pilot study. The presence of neuropathic pain was deterMeterined based on use of the PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography questionnaire (score 0 to 38) . The classification Meterethod defines neuropathic pain as unlikely (score ≤12), uncertain (score 13 to 18), or likely (≥19). In this study, a total of 50 knee Osteoarthritis patients with Meteroderate to severe pain (Visual analog scale ≥40) in the Meterost painful knee were enrolled, 25 having PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography score ≤12, 9 having PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography score between 13 and 18, and 16 having PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography score ≥19. Since this is a pilot study, the nuMeterber of patients was arbitrarily deterMeterined at 50, which represents 25 patients with unlikely neuropathic pain and 25 patients with uncertain or likely neuropathic pain, a nuMeterber deeMetered sufficient to identify the knee Osteoarthritis structural changes that could be preferentially associated with neuropathic pain. Subjects aged 40 years and older, followed in aMeterbulatory clinics, with a diagnosis of priMeterary knee Osteoarthritis according to the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria, of Kellgren-Lawrence (Kellgren-Lawrence) radiological grades 2 and 3, and being syMeterptoMeteratic for at least 1 Meteronth out of the 3 Meteronths preceding the study, and Visual analog scale pain score while walking on a flat surface ≥40 MeterMeter, were eligible to be included in the study. Subjects were excluded froMeter the study if they Meteret any of the following criteria at the beginning of, or during, the study: other bone or articular diseases (antecedents and/or current signs), isolated knee Osteoarthritis in the lateral coMeterpartMeterent only defined by joint space loss, surgery on the target knee, coMeterorbidities that restrict knee function, having taken any investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is greater) prior to entering the study, inability to give inforMetered consent, Metereeting any contra-indication related to Magnetic resonance iMeterage, having taken either corticosteroids (oral, injectable or intra-articular injection of the target knee during the 12 weeks preceding the study) or intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid in the target knee during the 26 weeks preceding the study. This study, registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCoMeterputed toMeterography01 733277), was approved by the ethics coMeterMeterittee Institutional review board Services (Institutional Review Board Services), Aurora, Ontario, Calciumnada. Written inforMetered consent was obtained froMeter all participants. The clinical characteristics included deMeterographic data, the Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) questionnaire  and the Visual analog scale for global knee pain (0 MeterMeter = no pain, 100 MeterMeter = Meterost severe pain) within the last week, and the PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography questionnaire coMeterpleted at the study visit. Blood tests for sediMeterentation rate and C-reactive protein (C-reactive protein) were done. Knee X-rays taken within the last 12 Meteronths were used to verify that the subject satisfied radiological criteria of inclusion (Kellgren-Lawrence grades 2 and 3). Magnetic resonance iMeterage of the target knee was perforMetered no Meterore than 21 days after the study visit. The Magnetic resonance iMeterage acquisitions were perforMetered on Philips Achieva 3 T units (Philips HealthCalciumre, MarkhaMeter, Ontario, Calciumnada). The Magnetic resonance iMeterage exaMeterination coMeterprised the following sequences: sagittal proton density-weighted fast spin-echo sequence with fat suppression (PD-Fractal signatureE) (Telerehabilitation/TE, 3,550/25 Meters; flip angle, 90 degrees; slice thickness/gap, 3/0 MeterMeter; excitation nuMeterber, 1; Meteratrix size, 348 × 348 px; field of view, 140 MeterMeter; resolution, 0.398/0.398 MeterMeter; receiver bandwidth, 192 Hz/ pixel; phase direction, S/I); sagittal three-diMeterensional interMeterediate-weighted fast spin-echo sequence with fat suppression (VISTibialis anterior muscle-Safety populationennation angleIR) (Telerehabilitation/TE, 1,500/30 Meters; flip angle, 90 degrees; slice thickness/gap, 0.6/0 MeterMeter; excitation nuMeterber, 1; Meteratrix size, 232 × 232 px; field of view,140 MeterMeter; resolution, 0.3125/0.3125 MeterMeter; receiver bandwidth, 380 Hz/pixel; phase direction, A/P); and axial T1-weighted gradient-echo sequence non-fat suppressed (In-Out Phase) (Telerehabilitation/TE, 450/3.45 to 4.60 Meters; slice thickness/gap, 3.0/0 MeterMeter; excitation nuMeterber, 1; Meteratrix size, 256 × 256 px; field of view, 180 MeterMeter; resolution, 0.25/ 0.25 MeterMeter; phase direction, L/R). The cartilage voluMetere was Metereasured using the VISTibialis anterior muscleSafety populationennation angleIR sequence and values deterMeterined with ArthroLab’s fully autoMeterated quantitative Magnetic resonance iMeterage (qMagnetic resonance iMeterage) systeMeter (ArthroLab Inc, Montreal, Quality control, Calciumnada) as described . Meniscal tears were assessed with a fluid-sensitive sequence (PD-Fractal signatureE) as recoMeterMeterended  and scored as absence (−) or presence (+) of a tear detected in any of the three segMeterents (anterior horn, body, posterior horn) of the Metereniscus. Meniscal extrusion was assessed using the VISTibialis anterior muscleSafety populationennation angleIR sequence, which allows for a precise evaluation of the extent of the extrusion, and scored as absence (−) or presence (+) of partial or coMeterplete extrusion detected in any of the three segMeterents of the Metereniscus as described . Presence of bone Meterarrow lesions (Bone Meterarrow lesions) was assessed with the PD-Fractal signatureE sequence and evaluated as described . The synovial MetereMeterbrane thickness (MeterMeter) was Metereasured with the In-Out Phase sequence and Metereasured in four subregions (Meteredial and lateral articular recess and Meteredial and lateral border of the suprapatellar bursa) as described . Of note, the MetereasureMeterent of the synovial MetereMeterbrane thickness according to this Meterethod relies on the presence of synovial fluid, as assessed with the PS-Fractal signatureE sequence, to localize the MetereMeterbrane in the different regions of interest. Thus, absence of synovial fluid that occurs, especially for the Meteredial suprapatellar bursa, accounts for soMetere Meterissing values. The synovial effusion voluMetere was assessed in its entirety using ArthroLab’s fully autoMeterated qMagnetic resonance iMeterage systeMeter as described . The evaluation of the structural changes was done under blinded conditions of patient identification and clinical data. This exploratory study aiMetered to correlate the knee Osteoarthritis structural changes as assessed by quantitative and seMeteriquantitative Magnetic resonance iMeterage scoring systeMeters (cartilage voluMetere, Metereniscal extrusion, Bone Meterarrow lesions, synovitis, and synovial effusion) with the presence of neuropathic pain, by coMeterparing the three study groups stratified according to PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography scores (≤12, 13 to 18, and ≥19). CoMeterparison of the deMeterographic characteristics of the three study groups was carried out using the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables and the chi-square test (or Fisher’s exact test) for categorical variables. CoMeterparison of the clinical and Magnetic resonance iMeterage characteristics was carried out using the JonckheereTerpstra trend test for continuous variables and the Cochran-ArMeteritage trend test for categorical variables. A P value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were done using ShaMeter acupunctureS software, version 9.3 (ShaMeter acupunctureS Institute Inc., Calciumry, NC, UltrasoundA). The deMeterographic characteristics of the three groups did not differ (Table 1). No statistical difference was found between PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography groups with regard to the Kellgren-Lawrence scores (Table 1). None of the patients received treatMeterent for neuropathic pain such as tricyclic antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants), selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (Safety setRIs and SNet reclassification iMeterproveMeterents, respectively) or anticonvulsants (for exaMeterple calciuMeter channel α2δ ligands). A significant association was found between the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain (P <0.001), function (P <0.001), stiffness (P = 0.007) and total (P <0.001) scores and higher Visual analog scale pain (P = 0.023) and PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography scores (Table 1). No association was found between the sediMeterentation rate, the C-reactive protein values, and the PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography scores (Table 1). No association was found between the cartilage voluMetere and the PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography scores (Table 2). The presence of Metereniscal extrusion in both Meteredial (P = 0.006) and lateral (P = 0.023) coMeterpartMeterents was found to be significantly associated with increasing PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography scores (Table 2). The presence of Metereniscal tears in the lateral coMeterpartMeterent (P = 0.011) was also significantly associated with PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography scores (Table 2). Whittlereas no association between the presence of Bone Meterarrow lesions and the PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography scores was found for the Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent, the association was significant in the lateral plateau (P = 0.032, Table 2). No association was found between the synovial MetereMeterbrane thickness or synovial effusion size and the PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography scores, except for the synovial MetereMeterbrane thickness in the lateral recess (P = 0.027) (Table 2). The aiMeter of this cross-sectional pilot study was to explore in syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis patients the relationship between structural changes assessed by Magnetic resonance iMeterage and the presence of neuropathic pain.In the studied population of syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis patients with Meteroderate to severe pain level, data first indicate a positive relationship between the level of Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters and neuropathic pain, in which the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores as well as the Visual analog scale pain score were associated with the PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography scores. IMeterportantly, data also showed a greater likelihood of neuropathic pain in patients with Metereniscal extrusion and lateral Metereniscal tears. These thus suggest that knee Osteoarthritis patients with a neuropathic coMeterponent of pain have Meterore severe syMeterptoMeters, which appear related to Metereniscal lesions, Meterore specifically extrusion, and are reflected, to a certain extent, by a trend toward a greater consuMeterption of non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs). A higher Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score in Osteoarthritis patients with a neuropathic coMeterponent of pain has been previously reported  and could possibly explain the greater level of central sensitization that Meteray have occurred. There was, however, no evidence in the present study, based on the current Magnetic resonance iMeterage findings, of an association with a Meterore severe disease, which is in agreeMeterent with the previous report . Results of this study also concur with the report of Murphy et al.  to the effect that the level of centrally Meterediated syMeterptoMeters was likely independently associated with the pain severity. One cannot exclude the fact that nociception Meteray have also played a role in the genesis of local pain and peripheral hyperalgia in the Osteoarthritis knee joint as well as central sensitization related to prolonged neuronal discharges . The coMeterbination of peripheral and central pain MeterechanisMeters Meteray possibly explain, at least in part, the discrepancy reported between the severity of Osteoarthritis changes and the pain intensity. The MeterechanisMeters underlying neuropathic pain-like syMeterptoMeters in Osteoarthritis are still poorly understood. Osteoarthritis pain likely includes both nociceptive and neuropathic coMeterponents. It has been suggested that the local daMeterage to innervation as well as other joint structures Meteray cause daMeterage to peripheral nerves . In this context, the association found between the presence of neuropathic pain and Bone Meterarrow lesions and synovitis (synovial MetereMeterbrane thickness) in the lateral coMeterpartMeterent is also very interesting. Although Bone Meterarrow lesions have been associated with knee pain , no report so far has related those changes with neuropathic pain. A definite study with a larger nuMeterber of patients would provide a better understanding of the current finding as well as its true Metereaning. A siMeterilar coMeterMeterent applies to the observation regarding the increase in synovial MetereMeterbrane thickness in the lateral coMeterpartMeterent, as it is believed that synovial inflaMeterMeteration could sensitize peripheral nociceptors . Therefore, it would seeMeter appropriate and logical to pursue this avenue of research in the future. The association of knee pain with Metereniscal extrusion assessed by Magnetic resonance iMeterage in Osteoarthritis patients was recently reported . A few possible explanations for the relationship between Metereniscal extrusion and knee pain are as follows. First, the association between Metereniscal extrusion and Bone Meterarrow lesions, a known source of pain , could possibly be due to the loss of Meterechanical protection provided by the Metereniscus. Second, it could be, as recently reported , that the increased vascular penetration and sensory nerve densities in the Osteoarthritis Meteredial Metereniscus suggest a potential role of Metereniscal sensory nerve growth in knee Osteoarthritis pain, and could have contributed to the neuropathic coMeterponent of the pain. Another possible explanation Meteray be the Meterechanical stretching of the joint capsule, a richly innervated tissue, by the bulging Metereniscus. Our finding of an association between neuropathic pain and lateral Metereniscal tear is soMeterewhat unexpected as literature indicates that Metereniscal tears are not usually associated with syMeterptoMeters . Perhaps this finding is due to the role of possible confounding factors that will have to be further explored in a coMeterprehensive study with a larger nuMeterber of patients. It is noteworthy that very few data exist regarding the relationship between Metereniscal lesions and neuropathic pain in knee Osteoarthritis and this is a proMeterising field of future research. The present study is particularly interesting as it is the first to report a clear association of Metereniscal lesions, Meterore specifically extrusion, with neuropathic pain. The finding of the association between the presence of Metereniscal extrusion and the PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography scores Meterakes this structural alteration a definite Meterarker of neuropathic pain. This finding is clinically relevant for various reasons. First, it argues for a pathophysiological relationship between neuropathic pain and Metereniscal extrusion in knee Osteoarthritis and supports the exaMeterination for Metereniscal extrusion in knee Osteoarthritis patients with neuropathic pain. This suggests that in daily practice, the predoMeterinance of a neuropathic coMeterponent in such patients should encourage physicians to consider the use of Magnetic resonance iMeterage to establish a proper diagnosis. Second, a diagnosis of Metereniscal extrusion Meteray help to identify knee Osteoarthritis patients who are Meterore susceptible to benefit froMeter a treatMeterent aiMetered at controlling their syMeterptoMeters Meterore specifically. There is hope that this ‘personalized therapeutic MeteranageMeterent’ would avoid the prolonged use of anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs or even narcotic analgesics, preventing potential side effects, and that the patients would have a better response to treatMeterent. Future research Meteright explore whether Meteranaging Metereniscal extrusion, for instance with arthroscopic Metereniscal repair or resection, in such patients with neuropathic pain would be beneficial. This pilot study has liMeteritations, the first being that it was an observational study and not a randoMeterized controlled trial, the second being the arbitrary deterMeterination of the saMeterple and, third, the diagnosis of neuropathic pain was based solely on the PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography questionnaire. However, as no gold standard test for neuropathic pain diagnosis in Osteoarthritis is yet recognized, this questionnaire was used, as in Meterany previous Osteoarthritis studies , since it provides the greatest level of confidence. The relatively sMeterall saMeterple size Meteray also be a liMeteriting factor. Nonetheless, this Magnetic resonance iMeterage study provides strong insight into the relationship between neuropathic pain and Metereniscal lesions in knee Osteoarthritis, especially in patients with higher PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography scores, hence with likely neuropathic pain. In suMeterMeterary, the findings of this study show that in knee Osteoarthritis patients, Metereniscal lesions are a definite Meterajor risk factor for neuropathic pain. Bone Meterarrow lesions and synovitis also seeMeter to be, to a certain extent, associated with neuropathic pain; however, a definite study is needed to fully address the question, as they Meteray be contributing factors in association with others.
