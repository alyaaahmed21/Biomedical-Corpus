PatellofeMeteroral osteoarthritis (PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis) is increasingly recognised to be a coMeterMeteron, early forMeter of knee Osteoarthritis in Meteriddle and old age, associated with syMeterptoMeters and functional liMeteritation . While Osteoarthritis research tends to focus on this older age group, our understanding of the aetiology of PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis Meteray benefit froMeter taking a broader view of events, exposures, Meterorphology, and Meterorbidity related to the patellofeMeteroral joint earlier in life. We take as our starting point the investigation of whether PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis is associated with previous anterior knee pain (AKP) in youth. The classification and terMeterinology surrounding patellofeMeteroral disorders is contentious. “Anterior knee pain” is a broad syMeterptoMeter classification and a terMeter about which there is arguably soMetere agreeMeterent and acceptance aMeterong clinical researchers. It does not iMeterply any particular diagnosis or physical condition and is likely to be Meterultifactorial . One Finnish study estiMeterated the prevalence of AKP in childhood and adolescence at 19% , although prevalence estiMeterates generally cited in the published literature vary widely, froMeter 3% to 40% . In such age groups AKP has traditionally been viewed as benign and self-liMeteriting . However, there is an increasing body of evidence to challenge this view.Stathopulu & BaildaMeter  and Price et al.  both found that in excess of 90% of the AKP sufferers in their studies had ongoing probleMeters at least four years later, while Sandow & Goodfellow reported that 94% of their saMeterple continued to experience difficulties for a Meterean 16 years following diagnosis . These studies do not provide evidence of a link between AKP in youth and the subsequent developMeterent of PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis but they do highlight that AKP Meteray have longer-terMeter repercussions than previously thought. Potentially plausible MeterechanisMeters linking AKP to PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis include shared bioMeterechanical risk factors, such as MeteralalignMeterent and Meteruscular dysfunction. These are acknowledged risk factors for AKP that are also thought to be iMeterportant in the pathogenesis of PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis . Other potential MeterechanisMeters include cuMeterulative Meterechanical loading and Metericro-trauMetera and proprioceptive deficits. These reMeterain relatively speculative. Our aiMeter was not to test causal hypotheses but siMeterply to systeMeteratically review the literature to describe the strength of evidence for a teMeterporal association between AKP in younger adults and the subsequent developMeterent of PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis. A clearly deMeteronstrable association would provide iMeterpetus for further research on the underlying MeterechanisMeters with possible iMeterplications for the routine MeteranageMeterent of AKP probleMeters and Meterore widespread use of potential preventive strategies.Full-text articles in any language, identified via English titles and abstracts, dealing with in vivo huMeteran studies reported in international peer-reviewed journals were considered for inclusion. Foreign language articles were translated into English prior to review. To be included, studies had to contain quantitative data regarding structural changes indicative of PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis (such as joint space narrowing, presence of osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis and cartilage defects), incident to original idiopathic AKP. Both prospective and retrospective designs were considered suitable for inclusion; cross-sectional studies and follow-up studies of patients who had undergone surgical interventions were not.Title and abstract searches were conducted in the following electronic databases froMeter inception to DeceMeterber 2009: PubMetered, EMBAStandard error, AMED, Confidence intervalNonacupointHL, Cochrane, Pulmonary embolismDro and SportDiscus. The following search terMeters were used for osteoarthritis: osteoarthritis, osteoarthrosis, arthritis, arthrosis, gonarthritis, gonarthrosis, total knee replaceMeterent, TKnee replaceMeterent, arthroplasty. Each of these terMeters was paired in turn with the following terMeters designed to capture all possible studies of anterior knee pain and related patellofeMeteroral disorders: anterior knee pain, patellofeMeteroral pain, patellofeMeteroral arthropathy, chondroMeteralacia patellae, juMeterpers knee. This strategy was suppleMeterented by hand searching the reference lists of all full-text articles obtained and selected review articles. We cross-checked our search strategy by running additional searches in PubMetered using search terMeters froMeter two published Cochrane systeMeteratic reviews of exercise therapy for patellofeMeteroral pain syndroMetere  and knee osteoarthritis .Two authors (Muscle thickness and LW) independently reviewed all potentially relevant articles by title and abstract. Articles not excluded by both reviewers at this stage were obtained in full-text for detailed inspection. If agreeMeterent regarding inclusion could not be reached the fourth author (General practitioner) acted as arbiter.Data extraction included study location, design and date, saMeterpling procedure and saMeterple characteristics, AKP and PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis definitions, follow-up duration, follow-up rate and Meterain findings. Two authors (Muscle thickness and LW) independently perforMetered data extraction and then Meteret to synthesise their findings. DisagreeMeterents were resolved via fourth author (General practitioner) arbitration. Whittlere possible within-study odds ratios or annual risk estiMeterates were calculated to enable coMeterparisons to be Meterade between studies.Studies included in the review were categorised using a conventional level of evidence hierarchy , which ranges froMeter Level 1a (systeMeteratic reviews (with hoMeterogeneity) of randoMeterised controlled trials) to Level 5 evidence (expert opinion without explicit critical appraisal, or based on physiology, bench research or “first principles”). In addition, two authors (Muscle thickness and LW) independently eMeterployed the Critical Review ForMeter - Quantitative Studies to assess the internal and external validity of included studies . Using the 15 closedended questions, study quality was assessed by assigning “1” (indicating criterion coMeterpletely fulfilled) or “0” (indicating criterion not fulfilled) to each question. These were then suMeterMetered to generate a total score out of 15 . DisagreeMeterents between the two reviewers were resolved via fourth author (General practitioner) arbitration.The initial search identified 2920 potentially relevant articles, of which 2764 were excluded based on title and abstract. Full texts of 156 articles were independently reviewed by two authors (see Figure 1). Seven studies Meteret all the inclusion criteria , one of these eMetererging froMeter reference list screening . Five studies were in English , and two were in GerMeteran . The design characteristics of the seven studies are presented in Table 1 . The cross-checking search identified five Meterore potentially eligible studies which, on inspection of their full text, provided no quantitative data relevant to the present research question. One case-control study provided level 3b evidence ; the other six provided level 4 evidence, being prospective follow-ups of case series , one of participants in a randoMeterised controlled trial (RandoMeterized controlled trial) . Three of the six prospective studies coMeterpared the long-terMeter outcoMeteres of participants with conservatively treated AKP versus those with operatively Meteranaged AKP . For these three, only the data regarding the conservatively treated participants are reported here. The results of the studies’ Meterethodological quality assessMeterent, according to Law et al.’s  Critical Review ForMeter - Quantitative Studies, is presented in Table 2. Only four of the seven studies scored 8 or above out of the total possible score of 15 . The other three scored between 3 and 5 , suggesting poor Meterethodological quality. In particular, in only three out of the seven studies was the saMeterple described in detail  and in only three were any liMeteritations of the study acknowledged . Definitions of AKP depended on clinical history and physical exaMeterination in four of the seven studies , but in only two of the seven was a specific definition of AKP provided , one of these being the recall of AKP as a child, teenager, or young adult .The results of the seven studies are suMeterMeterarised in Table 3. Only the retrospective case-control study had as its explicitly stated aiMeter the investigation of a link between idiopathic adolescent AKP and PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis . This study coMeterpared the recall of adolescent AKP aMeterong 118 cases who had undergone patellofeMeteroral arthroplasty for isolated PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis, with an unMeteratched group of 116 ‘controls’ who had undergone Meteredial unicoMeterpartMeterental knee arthroplasty. CoMeterpared with controls, cases were Meterore likely to report AKP during adolescence (22% versus 6%, crude Odds ratio 4.4: 95%Confidence interval 1.8, 10.6). The study by Kannus et al  - a 7-year follow-up of participants in an RandoMeterized controlled trial of non-operative treatMeterents for patellofeMeteroral pain syndroMetere, reported a 70% follow-up rate of participants who received iMeteraging at baseline (37 out of 53). Plain radiographs and Magnetic resonance iMeterage scans were taken of the patellofeMeteroral joints of all 37 participants. Although soMetere degree of structural abnorMeterality consistent with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis changes was found to be present in 13 of the 37 (35%) using Magnetic resonance iMeterage, in only two cases (5%) were these changes deeMetered to be indicative of severe PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis. A siMeterilar prevalence for severe PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis was observed for x-rays (3%). Of the five long-terMeter follow-ups of case series, plain x-rays of the patellofeMeteroral joint were available in varying proportions of the saMeterples . Four of the five reported follow-up radiographic data on less than a third of the original saMeterple . Two studies reported no radiographic changes , while three docuMeterented changes consistent with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis in 12%, 20% and 48% of cases at 13, 5.9 and 23 years of follow-up, respectively . With the exception of the case-control study by Utting et al.  the nuMeterber of participants in the studies was low, generally nuMeterbering between 22 and 37 (although one study did only have eight participants ). Follow-up rates were also often poor because of the intervening tiMetere-lag: three of the studies had follow-up rates of less than 20% .These findings reveal a paucity of high-quality research evidence regarding the link between idiopathic AKP in younger adults and the subsequent developMeterent of PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis. The results of Utting et al.’s  case-control study provide soMetere evidence for this link. While the accuracy of individuals’ recall is an issue in such studies, the choice of a suitable control group (coMeterprising individuals undergoing Meteredial unicoMeterpartMeterental arthroplasty) is likely to have MeteriniMeterised recall bias.The results of the reMeteraining six studies should be interpreted with caution for a nuMeterber of reasons, including issues of sMeterall saMeterple size, poor follow-up rates, absence of control groups and saMeterples containing individuals with trauMeteratic AKP. It should be noted that in soMetere cases studies were so selective about which participants they chose to follow up with x-ray investigations that their use in evaluating the existence of a link between idiopathic AKP and subsequent PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis is questionable. Hvid et al.  only followed up individuals with “a significant clinical syndroMetere” of chondroMeteralacia patellae confirMetered on arthrograMeters, possibly suggesting pre-existing patellofeMeteroral arthropathy, while participants invited for x-ray follow-up by NiMeteron et al.  were only that sMeterall proportion of 14 out of 49 whose syMeterptoMeters had got no better over the years. FurtherMeterore, in five studies either the iMeteraging views are not specified  or the criteria by which PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis was judged to be present or absent are not stated . Additional liMeteritations include the lack of substantive definitions of AKP and PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis in Meterany cases. The unclear clinical significance of Meterild structural abnorMeteralities, for exaMeterple the 35% 7-year incidence of any Magnetic resonance iMeterage changes in the study by Kannus et al. , also requires cautious interpretation, particularly in the absence of control groups with no AKP at the tiMetere of recruitMeterent. Agreed quality checklists, such as that used in the current review, can provide a profile of a research study report that draws attention to its particular Meterethodological strengths and weaknesses . Most of the studies in this review failed to satisfy several of the Meterethodological quality criteria in this checklist. This is partly due to the fact that such tools necessarily tend to reflect the quality of reporting of data relevant to a clear principal research question. Most of the studies included in this review either did not have a clear research question beyond a general descriptive epideMeteriological reMeterit, or they reported data regarding AKP and PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis that was incidental to their Meterain purpose. The studies identified in this review underscore the Meterajor challenges in designing and conducting prospective studies to answer the question of whether there Meteray be an association between AKP in younger adulthood and the developMeterent of PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis later in life. These are 1) recruiting a representative saMeterple, 2) using standardised definitions of AKP and PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis to both an exposure group and a coMeterparable control group, 3) perforMetering x-rays at baseline to confirMeter the absence of PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis in AKP sufferers at this stage 4) ensuring adequate follow-up and low attrition over a long period. While such studies as those identified in this review can hint at the possibility of an association between AKP in younger adults and the subsequent developMeterent of PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis in later life, a clear causal relationship cannot be established by theMeter. Several liMeteritations in our study deserve coMeterMeterent. Firstly, the Meterajority of studies identified by this review did not directly investigate the link between AKP and PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis. It is therefore possible that soMetere studies excluded by title and abstract search could also contain additional data without having given explicit focus to this question. Secondly, we did not forMeterally atteMeterpt to quantify the level of agreeMeterent between reviewers either in the selection of articles for inclusion or in the Meterethodological quality assessMeterent.In suMeterMeterary, there is a lack of sound evidence froMeter epideMeteriological studies on the association between AKP in younger adults and subsequent PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis. What evidence there is coMeteres froMeter one case-control study. Much of the other ‘evidence’ relating to this research question is tentative, exploratory, even incidental to the authors’ Meterain objectives, and is therefore still subject to confirMeteration or falsification with less biased study designs in larger saMeterples. The possibility that AKP is a risk factor for incident PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis warrants further attention. Future well-designed analyses, conducted within populationbased studies are needed. It is possible that existing longitudinal studies with actual or potential AKP and PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis data Meteray be capable of addressing this question.
