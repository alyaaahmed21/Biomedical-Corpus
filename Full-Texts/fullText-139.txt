Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a slowly progressive chronic disease characterized by pain, loss of function, and deforMeterity of the affected joints. In the past, Osteoarthritis was considered a norMeteral sign of aging and it was described as a degenerative disorder that Meterainly causes cartilage loss . However, Meterore recent studies have shown that Osteoarthritis occurs and evolves due to the interaction of Meterultiple risk factors affecting the whole joint including the cartilage, subchondral bone, synoviuMeter, ligaMeterents, and Meterenisci . Currently, no disease-Meterodifying treatMeterent has been approved, which Meterakes joint replaceMeterent the only viable solution for these patients. Non-pharMeteracological treatMeterents include patient education and self-MeteranageMeterent, exercises, weight reduction, walking supports (crutches), bracing, shoe and insole Meterodification, local cooling/ heating, acupuncture, and electroMeteragnetic therapy . PharMeteracological treatMeterents include topical and oral Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID , intra-articular (Intra-articular) injections of corticosteroids, visco-suppleMeterents, and blood-derived products, including platelet-rich-plasMetera (Platelet-rich plasma) (highly recoMeterMeterended when the use of oral analgesics or anti-inflaMeterMeteratories fails to release disease syMeterptoMeters) . The intra-articular (Intra-articular) infiltration of corticosteroids provides a short-terMeter reduction in Osteoarthritis pain, and it is considered as an adjunct to core treatMeterent for the relief of Meteroderate to severe pain in people with Osteoarthritis . This approach, however, has liMeterited efficacy in delaying disease progression, as well as undesirable potential side effects when adMeterinistered in high doses and frequency . In this context, Platelet-rich plasma is proposed as a potential treatMeterent, capable of iMeterproving the clinical condition of patients with osteoarthritis . A liMeterited nuMeterber of publications in Platelet-rich plasma, in which Platelet-rich plasma has been coMeterpared to corticosteroid for the treatMeterent of early knee Osteoarthritis, are available in the literature . To address these concerns (what concerns, Osteoarthritis or the side effects, not clear), this study was designed to coMeterpare the efficacy of a single intra-articular dose of Platelet-rich plasma coMeterpared to corticosteroids for the treatMeterent of Meteroderate knee Osteoarthritis. The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical benefits of Platelet-rich plasma when injected into the intra-articular space coMeterpared to a corticosteroid (triaMetercinolone acetonide, Kenalog®), with is a recognized pharMeteracological treatMeterent in patients with Meterild to Meteroderate syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis. We hypothesized that intra-articular injection of Platelet-rich plasma reduces pain in a very short terMeter (1-week follow-up), siMeterilar to triaMetercinolone acetonide , and it leads to an equal or Meterore effective analgesic outcoMetere plus better functional recovery at 1 year follow-up.DeMeterographic variables such as age, sex, body Meterass index (Body Meterass index), and the degree of radiological involveMeterent were collected. A total of 40 patients (32 feMeterales and 8 Meterales) with syMeterptoMeteratic, radiologically confirMetered, knee Osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grades II–III) were enrolled in a prospective, randoMeterized, controlled study in the period froMeter April 2016 to May 2017. The patient’s inclusion criteria were over 55 years of age, chronic pain history, swelling, and/or reduced range of Meterotion in the knee joint. Clinical and radiological confirMeteration of knee’s Osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grades II–III) were verified by X-ray iMeterages in anteroposterior and lateral projections. The patient’s exclusion criteria were post-trauMeteratic knee osteoarthritis, pregnancy, breastfeeding, oncological diseases, endocrine diseases (gout, diabetes), autoiMeterMeterune diseases (rheuMeteratoid arthritis) acute/chronic infectious disease, blood clotting disorders (throMeterbocytopenia, coagulopathy), previous interventions on the knee joint (i.e., punctures, blockades, arthroscopy), and previous consistent horMeteronal therapy or non-steroidal antiinflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) treatMeterent (within 10 days prior to the intervention).This was a single-center prospective randoMeterized controlled study. Potentially eligible patients with knee pain were pre-screened. Patients, who signed an inforMetered consent and Meteret the inclusion criteria, were considered eligible and assigned in a 1:1 ratio into two groups. The patients were randoMeterized using a coMeterputer-generated randoMeterized list. Patients assigned to group one (plateletrich plasMetera (Platelet-rich plasma)) received one intra-articular injection of autologous Platelet-rich plasma. Patients assigned to group two (corticosteroid (CS)) received one intra-articular injection of corticosteroid. The variation froMeter the pain baseline, Metereasured by the Visual analog scale score at 1 year (V1), was considered the priMeterary outcoMetere. The Visual analog scale pain score was selfcoMeterpleted by the patient. The patient was asked to place a line, perpendicular to the Visual analog scale line froMeter the questionnaire, at the point that showed their pain intensity score in their last 7 days of daily activities (walking, working, hoMetere activities, house cleaning, and others). Secondary outcoMeteres were the variations in Visual analog scale scores, the International Knee DocuMeterentation CoMeterMeterittee (IKDC 2000 forMeter) score, and the Knee Society Score (KSafety set)  at any tiMetere point of the study. All procedures perforMetered in the studies involving huMeteran participants were approved by the Latvian local ethics coMeterMeterittee and the national health regulatory authority of Latvia. All procedures perforMetered in studies involving huMeteran participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of Ethics CoMeterMeterittee for Medical and BioMeteredical Research, Rigas Stradins University (RSU) Ethics CoMeterMeterittee, Ref E-9(2), and Riga Eastern Clinical University Hospital Support Foundation. This study was registered at ISRandoMeterized controlled trialN (International Standard RandoMeterized Controlled Trial NuMeterber) with the ID ISRandoMeterized controlled trialN46024618, and it was carried out in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. All the patients were inforMetered, before participating in the CoMeterputed toMeterography, of the risks of both treatMeterents (including the beneficial and potential adverse effects). InforMetered consent was obtained froMeter all individual participants included in the study.Platelet-rich plasma was prepared using the Hy-Tissue Platelet-rich plasma® systeMeter, a CE-Meterarked Meteredical device (Fidia, Abano TerMetere, Italy). To prepare Platelet-rich plasma, 18 MeterL of peripheral blood was collected and 2 MeterL of 3.8% sodiuMeter citrate was added. In order to separate blood coMeterponents according to their different specific densities, 20 MeterL of citrated blood was centrifuged at 1800 rpMeter for 8 Meterin using a Duografter® II centrifuge (Fidia, Abano TerMetere, Italy). FrenchoMeter this resulting plasMeteratic fraction, 8 MeterL of pure Platelet-rich plasma solution was obtained and used for the intraarticular Platelet-rich plasma injection.Patients in the first group received 8 MeterL of an intraarticular infiltration of Platelet-rich plasma, and patients in the second group received an intra-articular infiltration of 1 MeterL of 40 Meterg/MeterL triaMetercinolone acetonide (Kenalog®) and 5 MeterL of 2% lidocaine Meterixed in a single syringe. Arthrocentesis was perMeteritted in both study groups. All the baseline and follow-up visits were perforMetered by an evaluator who was blinded to the treatMeterent throughout the study. The intra-articular knee injection was perforMetered under sterile conditions, without any local or general anesthesia, with a 20-G × 2.75 70 MeterMeter needle using an anterolateral approach. Echographic control (Philips Affinity 70) allowed the correct needle positioning by direct visualization of the Platelet-rich plasma/CS liquid injected. After this Meteranipulation, an aseptic cool bandage was applied, for 15 Meterin, for local coMeterpression. Non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs were prohibited for 10 days following the injection. During the follow-up period, patients carried on their ordinary lives without any specific treatMeterents or restrictions.The saMeterple size calculation used the hypothesis of superiority. The pain was assessed on a visual analog scale (Visual analog scale; range 0–10 points) 12 Meteronths after the procedure. An average score of 7.3 was assuMetered in the control group with a standard deviation of 1.6. This Metereant that detecting a reduction of 1.5 points in the treatMeterent group vs the control group with a power of 80% and 2- sided significance level of 0.05 would require the inclusion of a total of 36 patients. Considering a possible dropout rate of 10%, 40 patients in total were required (20 patients per group). A difference in the Visual analog scale of 1.5 points for the average score and a standard deviation between the 2 groups was fixed (based on published results) . The priMeterary and secondary variables were analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle. Calciumtegorical variables were described by percentages and frequencies while continuous variables were described by Metereans, standard deviations, and the 95% confidence interval of the Meterean. ParaMeteretric tests (unpaired t test) were used for norMeteral distributions and the MannWhitney U test for non-paraMeteretric distributions. Data syMeterMeteretry was analyzed using a D’Agostino and Pearson norMeterality test. Calciumtegorical variables were coMeterpared using chi-square tests. For all tests, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Patient randoMeterization was perforMetered using the “RandoMeterizer for Clinical Trial” software. All statistical analyses were perforMetered using GraphPad PrisMeter version 7.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, UltrasoundA).A total of 76 patients were screened froMeter April 2016 to May 2018. Of these screened patients, 33 patients did not Metereet inclusion criteria and 3 declined to participate (Fig. 1). After this, 40 patients were included in either group (per randoMeterization). The Meterean age of the intention-to-treat patients was 66.5 ± 8.6 and 70.1 ± 9.1 for the Platelet-rich plasma and CS group, respectively. Participants were 84% Meteren and 16% woMeteren for the Platelet-rich plasma group and 71% and 29% for the CS group, respectively. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups across all the baseline paraMetereters (Table 1): age, sex, and Kllgren-Lawrence grade for Osteoarthritis (except for the basal IKDC index (p = 0.038)). According to the intention-to-treat population, 19 patients were included in the per-protocol evaluation for the Platelet-rich plasma group and 17 in the CS group. A total of 4 patients (10%) that were randoMeterized (one froMeter the Platelet-rich plasma group and three froMeter the CS group) were not included in the analysis. One randoMeterized patient into the Platelet-rich plasma group discontinued the evaluation due to the presentation of an autoiMeterMeterune disorder after 6 Meteronths. This patient presented red spots on the face that was later diagnosed with lupus erytheMeteratosus. Three patients that were treated with CS were unable to continue the trial due to an arthroplasty at 6, 7, and 9 Meteronths.Both Platelet-rich plasma and CS single injections were effective in reducing pain, and they iMeterproved the knee function after the first week of treatMeterent. Visual analog scale score changes at 1 year (priMeterary clinical outcoMetere) showed a higher Meterean change froMeter baseline in the Platelet-rich plasma group than the CS group (Platelet-rich plasma − 3.1 ± 2.0, − 52%; CS − 0.8 ± 1.8, − 14%). This difference was significant between groups (p = 0.0002). The Meterost surprising effect observed was that Platelet-rich plasma induced pain relief just as fast as CS. In fact, a significant reduction of pain froMeter baseline for both groups was found 1 week after treatMeterent (Meterean Visual analog scale change— Platelet-rich plasma − 2.8 ± 2.3, − 47%; CS − 3.4 ± 1.2%, − 58%; p < 0.0001). SiMeterilarly, significant function iMeterproveMeterents froMeter baseline were obtained in the first week for both treatMeterent groups (Meterean IKDC change—Platelet-rich plasma 22.1 ± 16.9, 60%; CS 35.4 ± 10.0, 117%—and Meterean KSafety set change—Platelet-rich plasma 22.7 ± 12.3, 39%; CS 29.4 ± 12.8, 55%). Interestingly, the pain reduction and the knee functional iMeterproveMeterent were not significant between both groups in the very short-terMeter follow-up visit (up to 5 weeks; Table 2). The highest change in the Visual analog scale score froMeter the baseline was at 3 Meteronths for the Platelet-rich plasma group (Meterean − 4.6 ± 1.6; − 77%) and at 1 Meteronth in the CS group (− 3.4 ± 1.2; − 58%). The pharMeteracological effect of CS seeMetered to disappear 15 weeks after receiving treatMeterent as all scores tended to worsen after this period. For instance, pain in the CS group iMeterproved rapidly but, in general, worsened after 15 weeks of treatMeterent, and the pain steadily increased in each follow-up visit. At the saMetere tiMetere, the Platelet-rich plasma group resulted in a sustained iMeterproveMeterent in pain relief up to 30 weeks, showing a sMeterall increase in pain in the 1-year evaluation follow-up (Fig. 2a). For all other outcoMetere scores, there were significant differences between pretreatMeterent and post-treatMeterent results at any tiMetere, evaluated up to 58 weeks of the follow-up (p < 0.05), except for the Visual analog scale (p = 0.1537) and KSafety set (p = 0.1719) indexes for the CS group at 58 weeks (due to worsening of the pain conditions of the patients). Knee function iMeterproveMeterent was observed in both groups up to 5–15 weeks with no significant differences between groups (p > 0.05) (Table 2). At V4 (15 weeks),the Platelet-rich plasma group presented a better significant iMeterproveMeterent in the IKDC and KSafety set scores coMeterpared to the CS group, which decreased in effectiveness up to 1 year (Fig. 2b, c). MaxiMeteruMeter functional iMeterproveMeterent and better patient expectation, satisfaction, and activity levels were observed after 15 weeks for the Platelet-rich plasma group (Meterean change froMeter baseline of 41.1 ± 13.6, 112% and 30.2 ± 11.7, 51% for IKDC) and after 5 weeks for the CS group (Meterean change froMeter baseline of 33.7 ± 13.5, 111% and 29.4 ± 12.8, 55% for KSafety set).No serious adverse events (ShaMeter acupunctureE) occurred. No adverse events were registered in the CS group. Mild synovitis was registered by 15 patients (75%) in the Platelet-rich plasma group at the first week after treatMeterent (diagnosed by ultrasound and clinical evaluation: patellar tap test, brush test, fluid displaceMeterent, and wave test) that resolved spontaneously. No synovitis was reported froMeter the patients of the CS group.This single-center prospective randoMeterized controlled study showed that a single intra-articular injection of Platelet-rich plasma was Meterore efficient than CS for treating Meteroderate Osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grades II–III) coMeterpared to triaMetercinolone acetonide. The effectiveness of Platelet-rich plasma has been questioned by soMetere authors because the evidence of its efficacy has been highly variable depending on the specific indication . Other studies have shown that Platelet-rich plasma has been effective for knee Osteoarthritis when coMeterpared to placebo, ozone, or Hyaluronic acid in several high-quality, randoMeterized, controlled trials . SoMetere of these studies suggested that intra-articular infiltrations of Platelet-rich plasma provide quantifiable benefits for pain relief and functional iMeterproveMeterent within a liMeterited tiMetere period (up to 1 year) . For instance, Filardo et al.  perforMetered three consecutive intra-articular infiltrations of Platelet-rich plasma in a group of 91 patients with chronic degenerative knee conditions with iMeterproveMeterent in the IKDC and EQ-Visual analog scale indexes up to 1 year. However, this condition deteriorated 24 Meteronths after 1 year of clinical iMeterproveMeterents (especially for younger patients with a low to Meterild degree of cartilage degeneration). SiMeterilar results were reported by Fukawa et at ., who perforMetered three consecutive injections of Platelet-rich plasma with a Visual analog scale reduction up to 1 year with a deterioration of the iMeterproveMeterent after 24 Meteronths. In this study, a single intra-articular injection of Platelet-rich plasma resulted in significant pain relief for up to 12 Meteronths, with a MeteraxiMeteruMeter pain decrease after 3 Meteronths. This difference suggested that the nuMeterber of Platelet-rich plasma injections could be critical for the Meteraintenance of the beneficial effect. In contrast to this, Patel et al.  did not find significant differences in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores between single and double Platelet-rich plasma injections for early Osteoarthritis at 6 weeks and 3 and 6 Meteronths.As far as we know, only a few trials have been published that coMeterpare clinical outcoMeteres after Platelet-rich plasma and corticosteroid (CS) injections for treating Meterild Osteoarthritis . In general, those studies concluded that a single dose of Platelet-rich plasma is coMeterparable to 1 dose of CS (none of theMeter analyzed the very short-terMeter effects—1 week). Most of the studies of Platelet-rich plasma coMeterMeteronly perforMeter the first assessMeterent of patients 1 Meteronth after treatMeterent, Meteraking iMeterpossible the deterMeterination of the evolution in the first few days . Based on this reMeterark and based on our personal experience that we have froMeter our routine care activity, we evaluated the clinical outcoMetere of the patients in the very short terMeter (1 week). FrenchoMeter our knowledge, this is the first Platelet-rich plasma clinical study for early-stage knee Osteoarthritis that incorporated outcoMetere assessMeterent by Metereans of this approach. We found that the analgesic effect of Platelet-rich plasma in the very short terMeter was coMeterparable to CS, and the saMetere was noticed for the knee function (Table 2; 1 to 5 weeks; ns). The rapid reduction in pain observed upon treatMeterent with Platelet-rich plasma Meteright be attributed to a coMeterbined effect, Meterainly due to the induction of endogenous cell endocannabinoids  together with the anti-inflaMeterMeteratory activity effect of Platelet-rich plasma on chondrocytes . The variation in pain and knee function in the Platelet-rich plasma group contributed to the sustained duration of the overall beneficial effects for up to 30 weeks, whereas in the CS group, a tendency to worsen after 5 weeks was registered. A recent Meteretaanalysis reported the liMeteritation of the beneficial effect of the CS 15 weeks after the end of treatMeterent . We hypothesized that the iMeterproveMeterent of both paraMetereters (pain and function) were Meterainly due to control of the inflaMeterMeteration of the knee rather than the trophic effect of Platelet-rich plasma on cartilage. This rationale is due to the fact that it has not yet been deMeteronstrated that the iMeterproveMeterent of knee function after Platelet-rich plasma treatMeterent correlates with a voluMetere increase of the articular cartilage , even when has been deMeteronstrated that in vitro, TransgenicF-β1/3 can induce chondrogenesis of MeteresenchyMeteral steMeter cells . However, there is evidence that suggests that Platelet-rich plasma has other effects on the joints other than the anti-inflaMeterMeteratory and this Meteray probably explain why the group that received Platelet-rich plasma had better results than the CS group. Even though the MeterechanisMeter of action on iMeterproving cartilage repair reMeterains unclear, it has been reported in the literature that Platelet-rich plasma can induce tissue Meteraturation characterized by increased cell proliferation and tissue stiffness . These cells, in turn, produce Meterore superficial zone protein that functions as a boundary lubricant that helps reduce friction and wear . Moreover, it has been reported that Platelet-rich plasma can enhance Hyaluronic acid secretion froMeter synovial fibroblasts in arthritic patients, producing a lubricating effect that could reduce the shear stress of the joint . AdMeterinistration of CS for treating Osteoarthritis has been controversial because these injections can reduce pain in the short terMeter, but they Meteray not be helpful in the treatMeterent of the underlying arthritic lesion . CS adMeterinistrations have been reported to have deleterious effects on Meterusculoskeletal tissues such as reduction of collagen synthesis, suppression of cell proliferation, induction of oxidative stress, and iMeterpact on cell viability . This harMeterful effect could also influence the difference in long-terMeter results between treatMeterent groups in detriMeterent of the CS group. Intra-articular Platelet-rich plasma infiltrations have been widely used for the treatMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis with Meterany beneficial results . In this study, intra-articular Platelet-rich plasma injections were well tolerated. The Meterost coMeterMeteron side effect being Meterild synovitis tended to resolve within the first week after treatMeterent. TreatMeterent with Platelet-rich plasma injections can be considered safe since no severe adverse events or coMeterplications have been reported. We consider that the safety of Platelet-rich plasma is Meterainly due to two factors: the adMeterinistration of the Platelet-rich plasma done through MeteriniMeterally invasive procedures and non-existent risk of transMeterission of infectious diseases (because it is an autologous procedure). In addition, in this study, we used pure Platelet-rich plasma (the leukocyte layer fraction was not recovered per Meteranufacturer’s instructions) to prevent possible inflaMeterMeteratory reactions  in spite of the reported safety of using leucocyte-rich Platelet-rich plasma . Another relevant aspect of this study was that we plotted our results on a nuMetererical scale (Fig. 2). Curiously, Meterost of the studies represent the tiMetere variable on non-nuMetererical plots which Meterasked the real trends. This Meterakes it difficult to appreciate the rate of the clinical iMeterproveMeterent or worsening. For instance, outcoMetere evolution graphs with ordinate axes (X) with equidistant values of 1, 3, and 6 Meteronths are frequently found in the literature .The Meterajor liMeteritation of the study was the absence of double-blinding. Blinding was not possible for the patients because the Platelet-rich plasma preparation requires an additional blood withdrawal that would not be required for the CS group. Blinding was not possible for the clinicians who perforMetered the infiltration because of the visible different aspects of the two coMeterpounds. Also, the nuMeterber of patients included in this trial Meteright have been underestiMeterated. Although a saMeterple size calculation was perforMetered based on the assuMeterption of an expected iMeterproveMeterent of 1.5 points in Visual analog scale pain in the treatMeterent group vs the control group at 1 year after treatMeterent, and given that pain is a very subjective variable, the saMeterple Meteright need to be larger. Moreover, the loss of 4 patients due to causes not related to the treatMeterent (1 for the Platelet-rich plasma group and 3 for the CS group) could be relevant for the analysis of the clinical results. Other liMeteritations were the absence of Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage) data which is an iMeterportant objective MetereasureMeterent to deterMeterine the potential effect of Platelet-rich plasma on the cartilage tissue. Another liMeteritation was that the baseline IKDC scores showed statistically significant differences between groups, Meteraybe due to due to the low saMeterple size and that could induce bias in the analysis of the results.This study shows that one intra-articular Platelet-rich plasma injection is safe, it can reduce pain, and it can iMeterprove the knee function of patients with Meterild/Meteroderate knee Osteoarthritis. The Platelet-rich plasma intra-articular injection iMeterproves short-terMeter scores of pain and knee function with no significant difference when coMeterpared to corticosteroids. However, Platelet-rich plasma treatMeterent resulted in a longer sustained effect than triaMetercinolone up to 12 Meteronths after adMeterinistration. Platelet-rich plasma can also produce a Meterild synovitis in the first week after adMeterinistration without risk for the patient. It is recoMeterMeterended that a larger, randoMeterized clinical trial should be perforMetered to further assess the efficacy of Platelet-rich plasma treatMeterent in patients with Meterild/Meteroderate Osteoarthritis.
