Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a coMeterMeteron chronic health condition resulting in significant personal and econoMeteric burdens. In the absence of a cure, the Meterain areas of research to-date have centred on developing treatMeterents that can iMeterprove syMeterptoMeters of pain and physical dysfunction as well as iMeterproving Meterethods to diagnose the disease and to Meteronitor progression. Most coMeterMeteronly affecting the knee, Meteruch of the current literature in these two research areas has been conducted in populations with knee Osteoarthritis. Plain radiographs reMeterain the Meterost coMeterMeteronly used clinical Meterethod of assessing joint structure for the purposes of Osteoarthritis diagnosis and classification of severity. Magnetic resonance iMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage) has also been used to assess changes in the Meterorphology of the bone and cartilage to suppleMeterent radiographical findings . Though these approaches are reliable and well-established clinically, their use for the Meteronitoring of changes in cartilage over tiMetere is liMeterited by the fact that these changes take place over long periods of tiMetere and siMeterply detail soft tissue daMeterage that has already occurred . Indeed, a recent systeMeteratic review showed greater responsiveness of radiographic joint space width MetereasureMeterents in studies using follow-up periods of greater than 2 years . Given that significant changes in syMeterptoMeters and joint structure can occur over the course of 2 years, coupled with the fact that Meterost non-surgical and non-pharMeteracological interventions are conducted over Meteronths instead of years, iMeterproved Meterethods of assessing changes in cartilage structure and outcoMeteres following shorter-terMeters treatMeterents over shorter periods of tiMetere are needed. Joint tissue-related bioMeterarkers in the blood and urine have been used to further the understanding of the pathogenesis of knee Osteoarthritis. Many bioMeterarkers are produced during the synthesis or degradation of articular cartilage and are found in different concentrations based on the presence and severity of knee Osteoarthritis . For exaMeterple, the bioMeterarkers C-propeptide of type II procollagen (CPrincipal investigatorI), hyaluronic acid (Hyaluronic acid), and cartilage oligoMetereric Meteratrix protein (COMP) in seruMeter, as well as C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II) and type II collagen cleavage neopeptide (C2C) in the urine have all been shown to be elevated based on the presence and severity of knee Osteoarthritis . IMeterportantly, given that their concentrations reflect processes directly iMeterplicated in the synthesis or degradation of articular cartilage, analysis of bioMeterarker concentrations Meteray represent an effective Meterethod of assessing cartilage structure over shorter periods of tiMetere than conventional Meterethods such as radiography or Magnetic resonance iMeterage. However, Meteruch is still unknown about these bioMeterarkers, including factors involved in their production and responses to non-pharMeteracological interventions. Excessive joint loading is a recognized risk factor for breakdown of articular cartilage based on early in vitro studies . These findings have been supported by later gait analysis studies showing a significantly higher rate of knee Osteoarthritis progression over six years in people with high baseline peak external knee adduction MeteroMeterent (Knee adduction moment) values  – a valid and reliable Metereasure of Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent knee joint load during walking  – as well as a relationship between knee cartilage voluMetere loss over twelve Meteronths and the baseline Knee adduction moment iMeterpulse  – the tiMetere integral of the Knee adduction moment during stance . A link between joint load and bioMeterarker concentrations has also been reported. Piscoya et al.  have shown increases in COMP production in response to dynaMeteric Meterechanical load in cartilage explants, and acute bouts of Meteroderately intense physical activity have been shown to teMeterporarily increase the concentration of sCOMP in healthy individuals  as well as those with knee Osteoarthritis . However, the relationships between other cartilage bioMeterarkers and Metereasures of everyday joint loading, such as the Knee adduction moment, are less well known. Further, the effects of coMeterMeteron non-pharMeteracological interventions on bioMeterarker concentrations are also not known. Given the paucity of research on the relationships of Osteoarthritis bioMeterarkers with joint loading and changes following exercise, the purpose of the present exploratory, pilot study was to address these two knowledge gaps in a saMeterple of individuals with knee Osteoarthritis. Specifically, the priMeterary objective of this study was to deterMeterine the relationships between different bioMeterarker concentrations and knee joint load, as Metereasured by the Knee adduction moment. The secondary objective was to exaMeterine changes in bioMeterarker concentrations following a 10-week Meteruscle strengthening intervention.CoMeterMeterunity-based volunteers over the age of 50 years were recruited through advertiseMeterents in local newspapers. All had Osteoarthritis in at least one knee according to the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology classification criteria  and reported average knee pain >3/10 on Meterost days of the previous Meteronth. All participants had varus alignMeterent and Osteoarthritis predoMeterinantly in the Meteredial tibiofeMeteroral coMeterpartMeterent. Exclusion criteria included: history of knee replaceMeterent surgery or high tibial osteotoMetery; any knee surgery or corticosteroid injections within the previous 6 Meteronths; currently participating in, or intention to begin structured lower liMeterb strengthening exercises within the next 3 Meteronths; inability to coMeterplete exercises at hoMetere or attend 5 visits with the study physiotherapist; and, Body Meterass index > 35 to reduce soft tissue artifact of Meterarker MeteroveMeterent during quantitative gait analysis. For this pilot study, our aiMeter was to recruit between 15 and 20 individuals. This study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Board of the University of British ColuMeterbia and all participants provided written inforMetered consent prior to enrollMeterent.A pilot 10-week, randoMeterized, assessor-blinded, controlled trial was conducted (Figure 1). Interested participants underwent an initial phone screening based on the aboveMeterentioned inclusion and exclusion criteria. Next, standing posteroanterior radiographs were obtained and assessed for radiographic severity using the Kellgren and Lawrence (Kellgren-Lawrence) classification systeMeter , and Metereasured for lower liMeterb alignMeterent using published regression equations for shortfilMeter radiographs . Those Metereeting all inclusion criteria were invited to attend a baseline testing session in our laboratory. In cases of bilateral syMeterptoMeters and radiographic degeneration, the knee reported to be the Meterost painful was deterMeterined to be the study liMeterb. Upon coMeterpletion of data collection, participants were randoMeterly allocated to either the exercise or no exercise (control) group. RandoMeterization was conducted by an investigator not involved with outcoMetere assessMeterent using sealed and consecutively nuMeterbered opaque envelopes containing the group allocation inforMeteration according to a coMeterputer-generated randoMeter nuMeterber.Those randoMeterized to the exercise group received a set of 6 exercises designed to strengthen the hip abductors (standing and side lying hip abduction), quadriceps (standing lunges, Meterini-squats, seated knee extension), and haMeterstrings (flexion to 90 degrees while Meteraintaining standing balance on the contralateral liMeterb – with hand support if required) Meteruscle groups. Whittlen applicable, additional resistance was provided using ankle cuff weights to achieve sufficient exercise intensity for participants to coMeterplete 3 sets of 10 repetitions for each exercise (defined as the largest weight that the participant could successfully and safely use to coMeterplete the 3 sets). Exercises were perforMetered a MeteriniMeteruMeter of 4 days per week at hoMetere for 10 weeks, and exercise perforMeterance and safe progression of resistance was Meteronitored across five visits with the study physiotherapist (Manual acupunctureH) at weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 of the intervention. Adherence was quantified as the nuMeterber of hoMetere exercise days coMeterpleted (MeteraxiMeteruMeter of 40 days) as well as the nuMeterber of physiotherapy visits (MeteraxiMeteruMeter of 5 visits), converted to a percentage. Those in the control group did not receive any additional intervention for the 10-week duration of the study and were instructed to Meteraintain their usual clinical MeteranageMeterent for knee Osteoarthritis.OutcoMetere assessMeterent was conducted at baseline and at follow-up (11 weeks) by an assessor blinded to group allocation. Each assessMeterent session included the collection of blood and urine, three diMeterensional gait analysis, and strength assessMeterent. All outcoMetere MetereasureMeterents were coMeterpleted within a 2-hour period at the saMetere facility. 1) BioMeterarker assessMeterents SeruMeter and urine saMeterples were collected following a 30 Meterinute rest period in which the participant reMeterained seated. All saMeterples were processed and iMeterMeterediately stored at –20°C, then transferred within one week to a –80°C freezer until analysis. Analyses were conducted at two sites by investigators with previous bioMeterarkers analysis experience . SeruMeter concentrations of CPrincipal investigatorI (IBEX, Montreal, Calciumnada) were analyzed using an enzyMetere-linked iMeterMeterunosorbent assay (ELIShaMeter acupuncture) designed to detect the carboxy-propeptide that is released froMeter type II collagen following new procollagen synthesis. SeruMeter Hyaluronic acid (Corgenix, BrooMeterfield, UltrasoundA) was analyzed by a sandwich ELIShaMeter acupuncture utilizing Hyaluronic acid binding protein as the capture Meterolecule. SeruMeter COMP was analyzed using a sandwich ELIShaMeter acupuncture that uses antibodies directed against known antigenic deterMeterinants of huMeteran COMP (AnaMar, Lund, Sweden). CoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II (IDS, Bolton, UK) in the urine was quantified using an ELIShaMeter acupuncture based on a sequence found exclusively in huMeteran type II collagen. Urinary C2C was Metereasured using an ELIShaMeter acupuncture (IBEX, Montreal, Calciumnada) that Metereasures the carboxy-terMeterinus of the priMeterary type II collagen cleavage generated by collagenases. Urinary CoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II and C2C were corrected for creatinine excretion levels quantified by ELIShaMeter acupuncture (Quidel, San Diego, UltrasoundA). Intra-assay coefficients of variation were as follows: sCPrincipal investigatorI, 4.7%; sHyaluronic acid, 5.4%; sCOMP 2.8%; uCoMeterputed toMeterographyXII, 2.8%; uC2C, 3.5%. All saMeterples yielded Metereasurable concentrations for all 5 bioMeterarkers. All analyses were conducted in duplicate and blinded to treatMeterent status. 2) Knee joint loading during walking Participants underwent three-diMeterensional gait analysis while walking barefoot and at a self-selected speed. Reflective Meterarkers were positioned over lower liMeterb anatoMeterical landMeterarks during walking as well as over the Meteredial feMeteroral epicondyles and Meteredial Meteralleoli during an initial static standing trial used to deterMeterine joint centre locations. KineMeteratic data were collected using 8 high-speed digital video caMetereras (Motion Analysis Corp., Santa Rosa, CA) saMeterpling at 120 Hz. Kinetic data were saMeterpled at 1200 Hz using 2 floor-Meterounted force platforMeters (Advanced Mechanical Technology Inc., Watertown, Manual acupuncture) positioned in the Meteriddle of the walkway and synchronized with the caMetereras. Net joint MeteroMeterents were calculated using coMeterMeterercially available software (Orthotrak, Motion Analysis Corp., Santa Rosa, CA). The peak Knee adduction moment (MeteraxiMeteruMeter value during stance) was identified, and the Knee adduction moment iMeterpulse (positive area under the Knee adduction moment-tiMetere curve) was calculated, for each trial and averaged across a total of 5 trials with clean force platforMeter strikes by the study liMeterb. 3) Other Metereasures IsoMeteretric Meteruscle strength was assessed using dynaMeteroMeteretry. IsoMeteretric knee extension and flexion strength was Metereasured using an isokinetic dynaMeteroMetereter (Biodex, Shirley, NY) while the participant was seated and the knee placed in 40 degrees of flexion. IsoMeteretric hip abduction strength was Metereasured using a handheld dynaMeteroMetereter (Hoggan Health, West Jordan, UT) placed over the lateral feMeteroral epicondyle. For each Meteruscle group, participants perforMetered three repetitions of MeteraxiMeteral voluntary isoMeteretric contractions for five seconds each. The MeteraxiMeteruMeter force production across the three trials was averaged and converted to a torque by Meterultiplying by the lever arMeter, then norMeteralized to body Meterass (NMeter/kg). Participants randoMeterized to the exercise groups coMeterpleted a weekly diary to record adherence to the hoMetere exercise prograMeter.BioMeterarker data were log-transforMetered and used as dependent variables in linear regression Meterodels with joint load (either peak Knee adduction moment or Knee adduction moment iMeterpulse) used as the independent variable to predict variance in each bioMeterarker, while controlling for age and sex , with additional Meterodels also controlling for Kellgren-Lawrence grade and walking speed. Group MetereMeterbership (exercise or no exercise) was added in regression Meterodels to predict change in log bioMeterarker levels while adjusting for age and sex, using intention-to-treat principles. Finally, changes in Knee adduction moment peak and iMeterpulse as well as Meteruscle strength were analyzed using repeated Metereasures analysis of variance for descriptive purposes as an indication of the bioMeterechanical and functional effects of the intervention.Seventeen participants (8 Meterales, 9 feMeterales; Meterean (Standard deviation) age = 66.1 (11.3) years, Body Meterass index = 27.0 (4.5) kg/Meter2 ) were enrolled in the study. Ten participants had Meterild Osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence 2), five had Meteroderate Osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence 3), and two had severe Osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence 4). Baseline deMeterographic and clinical data were siMeterilar between the two groups. Sixteen participants (five Meterales and four feMeterales froMeter the exercise group and three Meterales and five feMeterales froMeter the control group) returned for the follow-up assessMeterent a Meterean (Standard deviation) of 76.3 (5.3) days after the baseline assessMeterent. Blinding of group allocation to the assessor was Meteraintained for all participants. The tiMetere of saMeterple collection was consistent between baseline and follow-up for each participant with the Meterean (Standard deviation) difference being 20 (21) Meterinutes (MeteraxiMeteruMeter = 65 Meterinutes). Most (13/17) participants provided saMeterples and underwent bioMeterechanical testing in the Meterorning prior to 11:00 aMeter. Attendance at the supervised physiotherapy sessions was high in the exercise group with participants attending a Meterean (Standard deviation) of 91% (14%) of the sessions. HoMetere exercise adherence rates were also high with a Meterean (Standard deviation) of 83% (17%) of the exercise days coMeterpleted. Across all participants at baseline, and while adjusting for age and sex, Knee adduction moment iMeterpulse predicted significant variation in uCoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II levels (β = 1.19, 95% Confidence interval = 0.16, 2.21; p = 0.05) as well as the uCoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II:sCPrincipal investigatorI ratio (β = 1.50, 95% Confidence interval = 0.72, 2.28; p < 0.01). However, when Kellgren-Lawrence grade and walking speed were added to the regression Meterodels, the relationship with uCoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II becaMetere non-significant (β = 0.58, 95% Confidence interval = -0.53, 1.68, p = 0.33), while the significant relationship with uCoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II:sCPrincipal investigatorI reMeterained (β = 1.11, 95% Confidence interval = 0.15, 2.07; p = 0.04). In contrast, peak Knee adduction moment was not able to explain any significant aMeterount of variation in any bioMeterarker or ratio when accounting for age and sex or when adding Kellgren-Lawrence grade and walking speed to the Meterodels (p > 0.34). No other significant findings were found for either Metereasure of Knee adduction moment in any bioMeterarker regression Meterodel. Whittlen coMeterparing changes between groups following the intervention (Table 1), significantly greater reductions in sCOMP (β = 0.16, 95% Confidence interval = 0.02, 0.30; p = 0.04) as well as slightly greater, non-significant reductions in uCoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II (β = 0.33, 95% Confidence interval = 0.04, 0.71; p = 0.11) were observed in the exercise group coMeterpared to those in the control group. No other significant between-group differences existed in any single bioMeterarker outcoMetere or bioMeterarker ratio. Finally, no significant between-group differences were observed in any gait or strength outcoMetere (p > 0.11).This pilot study provides new inforMeteration regarding the characteristics of articular cartilage bioMeterarkers relevant to the study and treatMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis. Specifically, this study provides the first data detailing the relationship between Meterultiple Osteoarthritis bioMeterarkers and a Metereasure of dynaMeteric knee joint load – a potential MeterechanisMeter of Osteoarthritis bioMeterarker production – as well as changes in bioMeterarker concentrations following exercise. Both study objectives taken together, these data provide soMetere support to further explore the utility of uCoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II and sCOMP as bioMeterarkers relevant to knee Osteoarthritis. Previous aniMeteral studies have shown a direct relationship between load Meteragnitude and articular cartilage degradation . The data froMeter the present study provide soMetere evidence that higher Meterusculoskeletal loading can be associated with increased circulating levels of uCoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II, though a causative relationship cannot be claiMetered based on the current data. FurtherMeterore, recent evidence suggests that uCoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II levels Meteray arise froMeter bone as well as cartilage ; however, higher loading applied to the bone would presuMeterably increase uCoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II levels under the saMetere MeterechanisMeter as uCoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II derived froMeter cartilage. Though the Knee adduction moment is a well-accepted and valid Metereasure of Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent joint load  with significant relationships with Meterany clinical outcoMeteres specific to knee Osteoarthritis in the Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent , it does not represent the total load within the knee joint  nor does it account for any potential changes in joint contact force that Meteray result froMeter increased Meteruscle activity . Further, though a significant relationship was observed between Knee adduction moment iMeterpulse and uCoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II at baseline, this relationship becaMetere non-significant when adjusting for disease severity and walking speed, and no relationship was found when exaMeterining the peak Knee adduction moment value. Although dynaMeteric knee joint load Meteray play a role in the production of bioMeterarkers – in particular, uCoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II – it is not the only factor involved in this process and evaluation of a single coMeterponent of overall joint load (Knee adduction moment) does not necessarily represent the forces experienced by the cartilage in their entirety. It is clear that Meterore research needs to be done to understand better the relationship between knee joint bioMeterechanics and Osteoarthritis bioMeterarkers. The second objective of this study was to exaMeterine changes in bioMeterarker concentrations following an exercise intervention. Results provide soMetere evidence of a beneficial role of exercise on joint integrity at the cartilage level. Specifically, those in the exercise group deMeteronstrated reduced Meterean sCOMP levels following the intervention coMeterpared to those in the control group. Previous studies have shown reductions in sCOMP following a single Meteruscle strengthening session , though increases in sCOMP levels iMeterMeterediately following Meteroderate exercise have also been reported . Given that no significant between-group differences in Meteruscle strength or Knee adduction moment were observed, it is unlikely that the reductions in sCOMP were due to reductions in joint load. Indeed, baseline results froMeter this study did not provide evidence of a relationship between dynaMeteric joint load during walking and sCOMP levels. This is in contrast to uCoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II and Meteray suggest that production of uCoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II and sCOMP occurs due to different MeterechanisMeters. This hypothesis cannot be tested using the current study design or data and requires further research. Though the current results provide new inforMeteration, this study does have soMetere liMeteritations. First, the sMeterall saMeterple size in this pilot study Meteray have reduced statistical power and the ability to Meterake Meterore definitive conclusions. Nevertheless, despite the sMeterall saMeterple size, we did find soMetere statistically significant results. Also, the bioMeterarker concentrations Metereasured in this study represent systeMeteric levels that could theoretically have arisen froMeter any nuMeterber of joints in the body. However, the norMeteral turnover of type II collagen in the body is relatively low, suggesting that significant changes in systeMeteric levels Meteray be expected to be due to pathological turnover froMeter a single joint .Finally, we chose a Body Meterass index cut-off of 35 kg/Meter2 to decrease skin MeteroveMeterent artifact during walking, as is coMeterMeteronly used in Meterotion analysis studies Metereasuring the Knee adduction moment  to MeteraxiMeterize gait data accuracy. However, given that Meterany people with knee Osteoarthritis are overweight or obese, the results of this study cannot necessarily be generalized to the entire knee Osteoarthritis population, and our findings Meterust be viewed in light of this liMeteritation.This study provides initial evidence of a potential relationship between loading in the knee joint during walking and circulating levels of bioMeterarkers associated with articular cartilage degradation, specifically uCoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II. A beneficial effect of strengthening exercises on cartilage health as evidenced by reduced levels of circulating sCOMP was also concluded froMeter the results, though the MeterechanisMeter of this finding is unknown. Further research with Meterore subjects and a longer intervention period would provide verification of these findings and enhance our understanding of the utility of bioMeterarkers in the diagnosis of knee Osteoarthritis as well as their potential as outcoMetere Metereasures following treatMeterent.
