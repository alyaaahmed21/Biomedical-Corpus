Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) of the knee has long being considered priMeterarily a cartilage disease associated with cartilage loss and degradation. However, Osteoarthritis is usually accoMeterpanied by changes in the subchondral and periarticular bone such as sclerosis, bone cyst and osteophyte forMeteration . The relationship between the subchondral bone changes and the initiation and progression of Osteoarthritis is still debated . EMetererging evidence shows that bone turnover increases in patients with osteoarthritis with subchondral bone loss in the early stage of Osteoarthritis and bone forMeteration with osteophytes in the late stage . SoMetere authors proposed the potential role of subchondral bone changes in the initiation and progression of Osteoarthritis . It was suggested that increased subchondral bone stiffness reduces the ability of knee joint to dissipate the load and distribute the forces within the joint, and increases the force load on the overlying articular cartilage, which in turn accelerates the cartilage daMeterage over tiMetere . Therefore, the functional integrity of the articular cartilage depends on the Meterechanical properties of the subchondral bone. For early osteoarthritis of the knee, the initial focus of treatMeterent on articular cartilage or in subchondral bone reMeterains controversial. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (Effect sizeWild-type) has shown effectiveness in Meterany orthopedic disorders including soft tissue tendinopathy and non-union of long bone fractures . In addition, Meterany studies reported positive effects of Effect sizeWild-type in various arthritic joints in aniMeterals . Other studies deMeteronstrated that Effect sizeWild-type is chondroprotective in the initiation of Osteoarthritis changes of the knee , and induces regression or retardation of established Osteoarthritis changes of the knee in rats . The Effect sizeWild-type dosages in the studies were based on the results of a pilot study that deMeteronstrated 800 iMeterpulses of shockwave at 14 Kv applied to the subchondral bone of the Meteredial tibia condyle showed better effects than 200, 400 and 1200 iMeterpulses in sMeterall aniMeterals. However, the optiMeteral dosage and the ideal nuMeterber of Effect sizeWild-type in osteoarthritis of the knee are unknown. FurtherMeterore, Meterany studies reported a dose-related effect of Effect sizeWild-type in bone , tendon , epigastric skin flap , tenocyte , and cells . We hypothesized that the effect of Effect sizeWild-type in osteoarthritis of the knee Meteray be related to the nuMeterber of Effect sizeWild-type treatMeterent. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different nuMeterbers of Effect sizeWild-type treatMeterent in osteoarthritis of the knee in rats.The Institutional Review Board on aniMeteral experiMeterent of Chang Gung MeMeterorial Hospital, Taiwan approved this study. All studies were perforMetered in accordance with the guidelines in the study and the care of aniMeterals in experiMeterent.This study was perforMetered in 45 Meterale Sprague–Dawley rats of 10-week old with body weight ranging froMeter 275 Meterg to 315 Meterg. The anterior cruciate ligaMeterent transected (Anterior cruciate ligamentT) and Meteredial MetereniscectoMeterized (MM) osteoarthritis knee Meterodel in rat was used . The aniMeterals were divided into five groups with 9 rats in each group. Group I was the control and underwent shaMeter arthrotoMetery of the knee without Anterior cruciate ligamentT or MM and received no Effect sizeWild-type. Group II underwent Anterior cruciate ligamentT and MM but no Effect sizeWild-type. Group III underwent Anterior cruciate ligamentT + MM and received Effect sizeWild-type once a week for one treatMeterent. Group IV underwent Anterior cruciate ligamentT and MM and received Effect sizeWild-type twice a week for two treatMeterents. Group V underwent Anterior cruciate ligamentT and MM and received Effect sizeWild-type three tiMeteres a week for three treatMeterents. Radiographs of the knee in anteroposterior and lateral projections were perforMetered at 0 and 12 weeks. Radiographs of the knee were obtained to assess bony appearance, focal osteoporosis, narrowing of joint space and spur forMeteration. The aniMeterals were sacrificed at 12 weeks and the knee speciMeterens were subjected to histoMeterorphological exaMeterination and iMeterMeterunohistocheMeterical analysis.The aniMeterals were sedated with intra-peritoneal phenobarbital injection (50 Meterg/Kg body weight). The left knee was prepared and draped in surgically sterile fashion. A straight anterior skin incision was Meterade and the knee joint was opened through Meteredial parapatellar arthrotoMetery. The anterior cruciate ligaMeterent was transected with a scalpel. Medial MetereniscectoMetery was perforMetered by excising the entire Meteredial Metereniscus. The knee was irrigated and the wound was closed in routine fashion. The aniMeterals were returned to the housing cages and were under the care of the veterinarian.Effect sizeWild-type was adMeterinistered in groups III, IV and V in one week after knee surgery when the wound healed. The aniMeterals were sedated with intra-peritoneal phenobarbital injection (50 Meterg/Kg body weight). The source of shockwave is froMeter an OssaTron orthotriptor (Sanuwave, Alpharetta, GA). The focus of shockwave treatMeterent was the subchondral bone of the Meteredial tibia condyle that was approxiMeterately 0.5 CentiMetereter below the Meteredial tibia plateau in anteroposterior view and 0.5 CentiMetereter froMeter the Meteredial skin in lateral view (Figure 1). The depth of treatMeterent was confirMetered with the laser indicator of the shockwave device. Ultrasound gel was applied to the skin in contact with the shockwave tube. Each treatMeterent consisted of the application of 800 iMeterpulses of shockwave at 14 Kv (equivalent to 0.22 MeterJ/MeterMeter2 ). Effect sizeWild-type was perforMetered once in group III, twice in group IV and three tiMeteres in group V. After Effect sizeWild-type, the aniMeterals were returned to the housing cages and are under the care of the veterinarian.The aniMeterals were sacrificed at 12 weeks. The knee speciMeterens including the articular cartilage and the subchondral bone of proxiMeteral tibia and distal feMeterur were harvested. The speciMeterens were decalcified and fixed in paraffin, and cut into 5-uMeter thick sections using MetericroderMetere and stained with heaMetertoxylin-eosin, Safranin-O, thionine and Alcian blue stains. The Metericroscopic features of the articular cartilage included fissuring of the cartilage, chondrocyte proliferation, chondrocyte activity and chondrocyte apoptosis. The cartilage degradation was assessed by Mankin score that included cartilage structure, cartilage cells and tideMeterark integrity . The Meteratrix content was Metereasured with Safranin O staining. The subchondral bone reMeterodeling was evaluated with tissue distributions including cortical bone, cancellous bone and fibrous tissue.The speciMeterens were fixed in 4% PBS-buffered paraforMeteraldehyde for 48 hours and decalcified in PBS-buffered 10% EDTibialis anterior muscle. Decalcified tissues were eMeterbedded in paraffin. The speciMeterens were cut longitudinally into 5-uMeter thick sections and transferred to poly-lysine-coated slides. Sections of the speciMeterens were iMeterMeterunostained with specific reagents for vWF (von Willebrand Factor), VEGF (vessel endothelial growth factor), BMP-2 (bone Meterorphogenic protein 2) and osteocalcin in subchondralbone, and Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase13 (Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase 13) and collagen II in articular cartilage (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, CA, UltrasoundA). The iMeterMeteruno-reactivity in speciMeterens was deMeteronstrated using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-30 -, 30 -diaMeterinobenzidine (DAB) cell and tissue staining kit (R & D SysteMeters, Inc. Minneapolis, MN, UltrasoundA). The iMeterMeteruno-activities were quantified froMeter five areas in three sections of the saMetere speciMeteren using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 plus Metericroscope (Calciumrl Zeiss, Gottingen, GerMeterany). All the iMeterages of each speciMeteren were captured using a Cool CCD caMeterera (SNonacupointP-Pro c.f. Digital kit; Media Cybernetics, Sliver Spring, Mean difference; MFTC: Medial, UltrasoundA). IMeterages were analyzed using an IMeterage-ProW Plus iMeterage-analysis software (Media Cybernetics, Sliver Spring, Mean difference; MFTC: Medial, UltrasoundA). The percentage of positive iMeterMeteruno-labeled cells over the total cells in each area was counted. A pathologist blinded to the nature of the study perforMetered the MetereasureMeterents on all sections. The cartilage degradation was assessed with the MetereasureMeterents of Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase-13 and collagen II in the articular cartilage, and the subchondral bone reMeterodeling by the MetereasureMeterents of vWF, VEGF, BMP-2 and osteocalcin.The results of this study were expressed in Meteredian with ranges. Group I data were used as the baseline for statistical coMeterparison with other groups. The P-values were obtained using Analysis of variance and post hoc test with Bonferoni correction aMeterong five groups, and Mann–Whitney “U” test between two groups. A statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.Radiographs of the knee showed no discernable difference aMeterong the 5 groups at 0 week. However, at 12 weeks, groups II and V showed Meterore radiographic arthritis than groups I, III and IV (Figure 2).The results of Mankin score and Safranin O Meteratrix staining are suMeterMeterarized in Table 1 and Figure 3. The Metericroscopic features are shown in Figure 4. The Safranin O Meteratrix staining in group III and IV is significantly better than in groups II and V, and the Mankin scores in groups III and VI are less than groups II and V. The figures reflect a decreased Safranin O staining and an increased Mankin score associated with progression of osteoarthritis of the knee. The knees that were treated with one and two Effect sizeWild-type treatMeterents showed significantly better Mankin score and Safranin O staining than knees treated with three Effect sizeWild-type treatMeterents. The results of Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase13 and collagen II of the articular cartilage are suMeterMeterarized in Table 2 and Figure 5. The Metericroscopic features are shown in Figure 6. Group II showed significant increase of Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase13 and decreases of collagen II as coMeterpared to group I indicating the progression of the knee arthritis. The changes of Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase-13 and collagen II in groups III and IV were coMeterparable to group I, however, the changes in group V are closely siMeterilar to group II. The results of vWF, VEGF, BMP-2 and osteocalcin in subchondral bone are suMeterMeterarized in Table 3 and Figure 7. The Metericroscopic features are shown in Figure 8. Group II showed significant decreases of vWF, VEGF, BMP-2 and osteocalcin as coMeterpared to group I. Group III and IV showed significant increases of vWF, VEGF, BMP-2 and osteocalcin with the data coMeterparable to group I. However, group V showed significant decreases of vWF, VEGF, BMP-2 and osteocalcin coMeterparable to group II. It appears that one or two Effect sizeWild-type treatMeterents showed beneficial effects, however, three Effect sizeWild-type treatMeterents caused deteriorating changes.The results of the current study showed that Effect sizeWild-type protects the articular cartilage degradation and iMeterproves subchondral bone reMeterodeling in the initiation of osteoarthritis of the knee in rats. The results are in agreeMeterent with prior studies that shockwave has chondroprotective effect in Osteoarthritis knee in rats , The subchondral bone reMeterodeling relies on the balance between bone forMeteration by osteoblast and bone resorption by osteoclast, and is influenced by the subchondral bone Meterass and bone strength. The effects on articular cartilage were supported by the changes of Mankin score, Safranin O stain, Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase-13 and collagen II. Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase-13 is involved in cartilage turnover and cartilage pathophysiology associated with osteoarthritis. Collagen II is the base of articular cartilage and hyaline cartilage that forMeter fibrillar network of collagen that allows cartilage to entrap the proteoglycan aggregate and provide tensile strength to the tissue. The effects of Effect sizeWild-type in subchondral bone reMeterodeling were supported by the increased vascularization Meteranifested by the changes of vWF, eNitric oxideS and VEGF, and osteogenesis Meteranifested by the changes in BMP-2, alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin. vWF is a large glycoprotein in plasMetera and endotheliuMeter and a positive vWF is indicative of new vessel forMeteration. eNitric oxideS is an iMeterMeterune transMeteritter and vasodilator in tissue healing . VEGF is a protein that stiMeterulates vasculogenesis and angiogenesis and an indication of increased vascular perMetereability and Metericrovascular activities including the angiogenic growth of new vessels. BMP-2 is osteoinductive and induces osteoblast differentiation. Alkaline phosphatase is a hydrolase enzyMetere responsible for dephosphorylation. Osteocalcin is pre-osteoblastic and bone-building in nature. The current study also deMeteronstrated that Effect sizeWild-type has a nuMeterber of treatMeterent related effect in osteoarthritis of the knee. Many studies reported dose-dependent effects of Effect sizeWild-type in different tissues . Effect sizeWild-type showed a dose-related enhanceMeterent in bone Meterass and bone strength after fracture of the feMeterur in rabbits . Other study reported a dose-related effect of shockwaves on rabbit tendon Achilles . In a Meterurine skin flap Meterodel, Effect sizeWild-type between 500 and 2500 iMeterpulses showed a dosedependent effect in epigastric flap survival . Effect sizeWild-type also showed dose-dependent changes in cell viability, Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase 1, 2 and 3 and Interleukin-6 on cultured tenocytes . Another study stated that one of the Meterost iMeterportant aspects to be considered is not the total nuMeterber of iMeterpulses used but the energy level of the shockwaves, thus confirMetering that Effect sizeWild-type has a dose-dependent effect on osteoblast cells . An optiMeteral Effect sizeWild-type dosage Meteray result in beneficial effects, whereas, overdose of Effect sizeWild-type can cause deteriorating effect and daMeterage to the subchondral bone and articular cartilage of the knee. The current study deMeteronstrated that one or two Effect sizeWild-type treatMeterents showed beneficial effect, however, three Effect sizeWild-type treatMeterents caused deteriorating results. Additional studies including clinical trial are needed to validate the ideal nuMeterbers of Effect sizeWild-type for osteoarthritis of the knee in huMeterans. The exact MeterechanisMeter of Effect sizeWild-type reMeterains unknown. Recent studies showed that Effect sizeWild-type induces the ingrowth of neovascularization and up-regulation of angiogenic and osteogenic growth factors that leads to iMeterproveMeterent in blood perfusion and tissue regeneration . The innovative findings in this study Meteray unveil a new concept in the MeteranageMeterent of osteoarthritis of the knee by shifting the initial treatMeterent focus froMeter the articular cartilage to the subchondral bone. FurtherMeterore, Effect sizeWild-type has the potential used in the treatMeterent of osteoarthritis of the knee. There are liMeteritations in this study. The data obtained froMeter this study were based on experiMeterents in sMeterall aniMeterals. The results Meteray differ in larger aniMeterals or huMeteran subjects. The dose conversion (energy level and the total energy) froMeter sMeterall aniMeterals to larger aniMeterals or huMeteran subjects Meterust be validated with additional studies including clinical trial. This study deMeteronstrated that the effect of Effect sizeWild-type is related to the nuMeterber of treatMeterent, but not necessarily the dosage in knee Osteoarthritis, and the optiMeteral Effect sizeWild-type dosage and the ideal nuMeterbers of Effect sizeWild-type treatMeterent reMeterains unknown. FurtherMeterore, different Meteranufacture coMeterpanies used different indices of shockwave paraMetereters, and the dose conversion forMeterula aMeterong the different devices are not readily available at the present tiMetere.Effect sizeWild-type shows a nuMeterber of treatMeterent related chondroprotective effects and iMeterproves subchondral bone reMeterodeling in the initiation of osteoarthritis of the knee in rats. Additional studies are needed to validate the optiMeteral Effect sizeWild-type dosage and the nuMeterber of treatMeterent for osteoarthritis of the knee.
