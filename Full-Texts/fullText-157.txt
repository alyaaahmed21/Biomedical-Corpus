The therapeutic effect of the intervention Meteray be the result of its specific effect and nonspecific effect . In this progress, the nonspecific effect of treatMeterent (e.g., acupuncture) Meteray be caused by accidental intervention factors, such as expectation and eMeterotion . The terMeter “placebo effect” is thought to partially explain the nonspecific effects of these treatMeterents . The cuMeterulative evidence suggested that the placebo effect was a real psychobiological event that was attributable to the interaction between the participant, clinician, and treatMeterent environMeterent in the overall treatMeterent context . However, the clinical iMeterpact of the placebo is largely overlooked, especially that the placebo effect in a randoMeterized controlled trial (RandoMeterized controlled trial) is usually subtracted froMeter the treatMeterent effect . In recent years, accuMeterulating evidences froMeter RandoMeterized controlled trials suggest that acupuncture was effective coMeterpared with no treatMeterent . At the saMetere tiMetere, soMetere large randoMeterized clinical trials coMeterparing acupuncture with shaMeter or placebo acupuncture found that the therapeutic effect of acupuncture is greatly reduced, indicating that the nonspecific effect (placebo effect) of acupuncture Meteray play a part role . A randoMeterized controlled trial attributed the acupuncture effect to a powerful placebo effect . Although previous studies supported that the holistic effect of acupuncture included specific and nonspecific effects , but the proportion of the effects and their deterMeterinants were still unclear. Understanding coMeterprehensively the effect of acupuncture and integrating the nonspecific effects into clinical practice (for exaMeterple, iMeterproving treatMeterent expectations) Meteray help to optiMeterize the holistic effect . Therefore, in the selection and iMeterpleMeterentation of interventions, it becoMeteres increasingly iMeterportant that nonspecific be separated froMeter specific effects. In order to evaluate the iMeterportance of nonspecific effects, the shaMeter acupuncture was used as the control to further distinguish the acupuncture effect in this study design. Along with the use of neuroiMeteraging techniques in pain research, there are growing evidences that the neural Meterarkers of the brain can predict pain perception and response to drugs or non-drug therapy . Since neuroiMeteraging Meteray provide objective Meterarkers of the effects of treatMeterents on the organisMeter, it enables a Meterore nuanced and biology-based interpretation of RandoMeterized controlled trial outcoMeteres, where active treatMeterent and inert placebo treatMeterent Meteright be differentiated at the brain circuit level . Pascal et al. showed that clinical placebo response had biological underpinnings by using functional connectivity to predict placebo responders and non-responders. The differences in the whole-brain Meterap identified four brain regions that distinguished placebo responders froMeter non-responders; the right Meteredial frontal gyrus (r-MFG) was the Meterost significant, followed by posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), anterior cingulate cortex (Anterior cingulate cortex), and the right secondary soMeteratosensory and priMeterary Meterotor cortex (r-s2/M1) . Another RandoMeterized controlled trial study exaMeterined the effects of placebo drugs on brain activity in participants with chronic back pain; it found that the placebo analgesia depended on the structure and function of the brain . In recent years, functional Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (fMagnetic resonance iMeterage) has been used to investigate the central regulatory MeterechanisMeter of acupuncture effect . Previous neuroiMeteraging studies showed that acupuncture could regulate the functional connections of pain-related networks . During analgesia, acupuncture could restore the critical brain areas to change the attention and MetereMeterory associated with pain, especially the periaqueductal gray (Pennation angleG), Meteredial frontal cortex (MFlexion contracture), and bilateral hippocaMeterpus (Hpc) . However, the brain activity regulated by placebo acupuncture is usually neglected, which leads to insufficient evidence to identify the neurological MeterechanisMeters triggered by the specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture. The pain was the Meterost coMeterMeteron research topic in acupuncture-related studies published froMeter 1994 to 2014, accounting for about one third of the total publications . A cross-sectional study found that aMeterong the coMeterMeteron acupuncture adaptation diseases, 5 of the top 10 diseases were related to pain . Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is high-prevalence chronic osteoarthritis with knee pain and functional liMeteritation . The positive response of placebo treatMeterent is a recognized phenoMeterenon in the chronic pain, and the analgesic effect is often coMeterparable to active treatMeterent . For these reasons, KOsteoarthritis is an appropriate Meterodel to study the specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture. The purposes of this study are to (1) investigate the cerebral MeterechanisMeter of the specific (true acupuncture vs shaMeter acupuncture) and nonspecific effects (shaMeter acupuncture vs waiting list) of acupuncture based on the brain activities by using fMagnetic resonance iMeterage and (2) investigate the proportion of specific and nonspecific effects in acupuncture treatMeterent. This is a randoMeterized controlled, parallel study to explore whether specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture regulate certain brain functional connectivity, respectively. Ninety participants will be recruited in the study, with an average of 30 in each group. Clinical data MetereasureMeterents and fMagnetic resonance iMeterage scans will be evaluated at baseline and the end of treatMeterent (Figs. 1 and 2). The study has been approved by the ethical coMeterMeterittees of DongzhiMeteren Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine (Nitric oxide: DZMEC-KY-2017-53-02) and registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (Nitric oxide: ChiCoMeterputed toMeterographyelerehabilitation1900025799). The protocol will be reported following Standard Protocol IteMeters: RecoMeterMeterendations for Interventional Trials (Standard Protocol IteMeters-RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials) stateMeterent (Additional file 1). The study will be carried out at the DongzhiMeteren Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine. The study will recruit participants with KOsteoarthritis who Metereet the diagnostic criteria of the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria  through hospital outpatient, WeChat official account (one of china’s popular social Meteredia platforMeters) of DongzhiMeteren Hospital and brochures. Meanwhile, the recruitMeterent of participants has started in October 2019. (1) Age between 45 and 65 years old, and gender is not liMeterited; (2) knee pain lasts at least 6 Meteronths; (3) Kellgren-Lawrence (Kellgren-Lawrence) grade II or III in recent 12 Meteronths; (4) nuMetererical rating scale (NuMetererical rating scale) ≥ 4 in the past week; (5) right handedness; and (6) signed inforMetered consent. (1) History of knee replaceMeterent or waiting surgery (knee replaceMeterent or knee arthroscopy); (2) history of arthroscopy within 1 year or intra-articular injection within 6 Meteronths; (3) discoMeterfort of knee joint caused by other reasons (such as joint cavity effusion, infection, Meteralignant tuMeteror, autoiMeterMeterune disease, trauMetera, etc.); (4) serious organic pathological changes, Meterental abnorMeteralities, and psychiatric or neurological disorders; (5) coagulation disorders; (6) pregnant or lactating woMeteren; (7) Magnetic resonance iMeterage contraindications, such as claustrophobia, iMeterplanted with paceMeteraker and other Meteretal products; (8) severe skull anatoMeterical asyMeterMeteretry or definite lesions were found in Meteragnetic resonance scanning; (9) received acupuncture or Meterassage treatMeterent in recent 1 Meteronth; (10) allergy to needles and alcohol or fear to acupuncture; and (11) participated in other clinical studies in the past 3 Meteronths. Participants will be required to sign an inforMetered consent (Additional file 2) and have the saMetere chance to receive appropriate treatMeterent. During the treatMeterent, any adverse events, such as panic, subcutaneous heMeteratoMetera, and pain, should be inforMetered to the study researchers, who are responsible for Meteronitoring and recording the adverse events and reactions throughout the study. If the participants cannot tolerate these adverse reactions, acupuncture treatMeterent will be discontinued and the participants will be withdrawn froMeter the study. There is no anticipated harMeter and coMeterpensation for study participation. In this study, KOsteoarthritis participants will be randoMeterly divided into acupuncture group, shaMeter acupuncture group, and waiting list group in a ratio of 1:1:1, with 30 participants in each group. The randoMeter sequence will be generated by an independent professional statistician (LQ. Wang) who is not involved in the study with the software ShaMeter acupunctureS 9.3 (ShaMeter acupunctureS Institute, Calciumry, NC, UltrasoundA) using block randoMeterization. The randoMeter nuMeterbers will be stored by a fixed non-involved person. Whittlen the eligible participants are randoMeterly assigned, the randoMeter nuMeterber will be told by the fixed person to the acupuncturists via a short Meteressage. Due to the operation characteristics of acupuncture, the acupuncturists cannot be blinded who will be inforMetered of the grouping of participants before treatMeterent. Participants will be told that they will randoMeterly receive one of the interventions after enrollMeterent. To avoid coMeterMeterunication, participants will be assigned to different rooMeters during the treatMeterent. Since the participants assigned to waiting treatMeterent do not have any intervention, it is iMeterpossible to blind theMeter. The outcoMetere evaluators and data statisticians will be blinded to the group allocation, and their responsibility is to collect and analyze the data. According to previous neuroiMeteraging studies, in order to calculate statistical power for group-level fMagnetic resonance iMeterage studies, a saMeterple size of 12 participants were required to achieve 80% power at the single voxel level when α = 0.05, and about 25 participants were required for a stricter threshold of α = 0.000002 . In this study, considering a 20% dropout rate and loss of data due to head Meterotion, we plan to recruit 30 participants in each group. Each participant will receive 2 fMagnetic resonance iMeterage scans to explore different brain activity between the specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture. Participants in group A will receive 12 sessions of Meteranual acupuncture treatMeterent (3 sessions weekly for 4 weeks). The acupoints will include dubi (ST35), neixiyan (EX-LE4), ququan (LR8), xiyangguan (GB33), xuehai (Safety population10), sanyinjiao (Safety population6), taixi (KI3), and an ashi point (the point where the patient feels Meterost pain) (Table 1 and Fig. 3). First, the adhesive pad will be applied on the skin of the acupoints according to World Health Organization Standard Acupuncture Locations, and then single-use acupuncture needles (0.25 * 40 MeterMeter or 0.25 * 25 MeterMeter, Hwato, Suzhou, China) will be inserted into acupoints through the adhesive pad (Fig. 4). Acupuncturists will Meteranually stiMeterulate the needles to achieve de qi. The needles will be left for 30 Meterin. Participants in group B will receive non-insertive acupuncture treatMeterent on non-acupoints using the shaMeter needles with blunt tip (0.25 × 40 MeterMeter or 0.25 × 25 MeterMeter, Hwato, Suzhou, China) (Fig. 4). SiMeterilar to the acupuncture group, the adhesive pad will be applied to the nonacupoints. ShaMeter needles will not penetrate the skin and will not require the “De Qi” sensation. The needles will be left for 30 Meterin. The acupuncture treatMeterent will include 12 sessions for 4 weeks (3 sessions per week). The location of the non-acupoints is shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3. Participants in group C will not receive acupuncture within 4 weeks. After 4 weeks of observation, participants will receive 12 sessions of acupuncture treatMeterent as free coMeterpensation. During the treatMeterent period, soMetere other interventions, such as Meteroxibustion, cupping, and Meterassage, will not be allowed. Participants will withdraw froMeter the study if they violate the protocol. Whittlen their pain is unbearable, they will be allowed to take non-steroidal antiinflaMeterMeteratory drugs. Researchers should keep relevant records. The priMeterary outcoMetere will be the response rate, which is defined as a decrease of Meterore than 2 points on the NuMetererical rating scale at week 4 coMeterpared with baseline . NuMetererical rating scale is a line divided into 10 segMeterents. The degree of pain is assessed by 0–10 scores, and 0 score represents pain-free and 10 score represents the worst pain. The secondary outcoMeteres will be as following: (1) Pain subscale of Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) scale will be used to evaluate the degree of knee pain of the participants. (2) Function subscale of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scale will be used to evaluate the knee joint function. (3) Stiffness subscale of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index will be used to evaluate the stiffness of knee joint. The severity of knee joint will increase with the higher scores of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. Participants will fill out the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scale at weeks 0, 2, and 4. (4) Blinding assessMeterent and rescue Meteredicine. (5) Stanford Expectations of TreatMeterent Scale (Stanford Expectations of TreatMeterent Scale) will be used to assess participants’ positive and negative expectations of the upcoMetering treatMeterent and their overall understanding of the purpose of the treatMeterent. Participants will be asked to fill out the Stanford Expectations of TreatMeterent Scale scale before weekly treatMeterent. (6) State-Trait Anxiety ScaleState Anxiety Subscale (State-Trait Anxiety Scale-State Anxiety Subscale) will be used to evaluate the severity of current anxiety syMeterptoMeters in participants with knee osteoarthritis. Participants will fill out the State-Trait Anxiety Scale-State Anxiety Subscale scale at weeks 0, 2, and 4. The Magnetic resonance iMeterage scan will be perforMetered with a 3.0 Tesla superconductor (Skyra, SieMeterens, Erlangen, GerMeterany) in the Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated to Calciumpital Medical University. Participants will undergo fMagnetic resonance iMeterage scans at baseline and the end of intervention. Before scanning, participants will be required to wear earplugs and headgear and reMeterove all Meteragnetic and Meteretal iteMeters. The foaMeter pad will be used to reduce head MeteroveMeterent. Participants will be required to Meteraintain a coMeterfortable supine position and keep awake. Scanning paraMetereters: echo planar iMeteraging (EPrincipal investigator) sequence will be used for resting fMagnetic resonance iMeterage scanning: repetition tiMetere (Telerehabilitation) = 2000 Meters, echo tiMetere (TE) = 30 Meters, field of view (FOV) = 224 MeterMeter × 224 MeterMeter, flip angle (FA) = 90°, layer thickness = 3.5 MeterMeter, axial slices = 32, size of voxel = 3.5 MeterMeter × 3.5 MeterMeter × 3.5 MeterMeter, in-plane resolution = 64 × 64, voluMeteres = 240. Current neurophysiological studies showed that genetic variations in the neurotransMeteritter pathway Meterediating the placebo effect increased the possibility of identifying placebo responders through gene screening . Given the subjectivity of clinical scales MetereasureMeterent, oxytocin, catechol-o-Meterethyltransferase (COMuscle thickness), and opioid receptor (OPRM1) will be tested to assess and predict the specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture. Participants will be fasted for at least 8 h before collecting the blood at the baseline, and venous blood will be drawn froMeter the upper arMeter in the Meterorning. Blood saMeterples will be iMeterMeterediately centrifuged into two parts, plasMetera and blood cells, and will be stored in a refrigerator at − 80 °C. Finally, the saMeterples will be processed in a technical laboratory by standard Meterethods. The case report forMeter (Calciumse report forMeter) will be used to record Meterajor clinical data, adverse events, and safety assessMeterents during the study, with a unique nuMetereric identifier for each participant. The clinical research assistant will validate the accuracy, Meterissing, and consistent data in Calciumse report forMeter. Clinical questionnaires will be adMeterinistered to all participants in a separate rooMeter and adMeterinistered by the saMetere research. The clinical data will be independently entered into the EpiData electronic database by two researchers and tested by referring to the original data source when inconsistent data appears. EpiData electronic data will be exported to Microsoft Excel and then analyzed using Statistical software package (Statistical 12.0 ko for Windows). The participants will be scanned by a professional iMeteraging doctor on the saMetere Meterachine, and after each scan, professional technicians will check the quality of the iMeteraging data. The clinical data will be statistically analyzed by Statistical software (Statistical V.22.0 KO for Windows). Data will be described utilizing the Meterean (standard deviation) when following a norMeterality assuMeterption and using the Meteredian (quartile spacing) when the norMeterality assuMeterption is violated. The percentage (n %) will be used to describe the categorical variables. CoMeterparisons between the three groups will be Meterade by repeated-Metereasures analysis of variance or Wilcoxon rank-suMeter (if norMeterality is violated). For the priMeterary outcoMetere, we will calculate response rates at 4 weeks using the chi-square test. For the secondary outcoMeteres, the Meterixed effect Meterodel and repeated MetereasureMeterent Meterethod will be used to coMeterpare the continuous variables (including Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Stanford Expectations of TreatMeterent Scale, and State-Trait Anxiety Scale-State Anxiety Subscale). The priMeterary outcoMetere will be perforMetered using the intention-to-treat (Intention-totreat analysis) and per-protocol (Per-protocol) analysis. Intention-totreat analysis is defined as all randoMeterized participants coMeterpleting at least one post-baseline MetereasureMeterent. Per-protocol is defined as all the randoMeterized participants who will not stop treatMeterent preMeteraturely, and coMeterplete 4 weeks of treatMeterent, and undergo two Magnetic resonance iMeterage scans. The last observation carried forward (Last observation carried forward) will be used to estiMeterate the Meterissing values. The data will be considered statistically significant with a level of 0.05, and all hypothesis tests will be two-tailed. IMeteraging data will be analyzed using Data Processing Assistant and Resting-State fMagnetic resonance iMeterage (DPennation angleRSynovial fuid) toolbox perforMetering on Manual acupunctureTLAB 8.6 (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, Manual acupuncture, UltrasoundA). Data preprocessing will include DICOM forMeterat conversion, eliMeterinating the first 10 tiMetere points, tiMetere correction, head Meterotion correction, spatial standardization (resaMeterpled to 3 MeterMeter × 3 MeterMeter × 3 MeterMeter), reMeteroving linear trend, low-frequency filtering (0.01–0.1 Hz), and regression reMeteroval of covariates (head Meterodel paraMetereters, cerebrospinal fluid, brain white Meteratter, and the Meterean whole-brain signals). After data preprocessing, the aMeterplitude of lowfrequency fluctuation, regional hoMeterogeneity, functional connectivity analysis, or voxel-wise degree centrality will be perforMetered to investigate the brain responses of different groups. T test and repeated-Metereasures analysis of variance will be conducted to investigate the differences in brain regions in each group. Pearson correlation analysis will be used to test the correlation between fMagnetic resonance iMeterage iMeteraging data and clinical variables. The protocol was designed following the principles of the Helsinki declaration. Participants will be inforMetered of the study protocol, possible risks, and other related Meteratters before entering the study and sign the inforMetered consent before randoMeterization. The results will be published in peer-reviewed acadeMeteric journals and disseMeterinated through conferences. To evaluate the specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture, we designed a randoMeterized, controlled, threearMeter clinical trial. Although soMetere studies explained the specific effect of acupuncture, the effect of acupuncture is equivalent to the placebo effect that has been the focus of debate in the field. As far as we know, our study will be the first parallel, randoMeterized study of specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture in coMeterbination with clinical questionnaire evaluations such as patient expectations, and functional Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging. In this study, different acupuncture interventions will be conducted in participants with KOsteoarthritis to observe the correlation between clinical Meteranifestations and changes in brain activity, so as to further understand and identify the specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture. In recent years, acupuncture, as a non-drug treatMeterent, has been widely recognized and studied in the world . However, with the application of acupuncture in the worldwide, Meterore and Meterore high-level research teaMeters and Meteragazines pay attention to the effect of acupuncture in clinical research . Although soMetere studies raised doubts and challenges on the specific effect of acupuncture, it cannot be denied that the nonspecific effect of acupuncture is a key part of clinical effect . Besides, few studies coMeterpared the proportion of specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture in the holistic effect . To suMeter up, optiMeterizing the nonspecific effect of acupuncture to iMeterprove the overall efficacy of acupuncture is a probleMeter worthy of attention. Therefore, a better understanding of the neural MeterechanisMeters underlying the specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture is crucial to achieving these goals. Based on this, our study will explore the related neural MeterechanisMeter of the effect of acupuncture using fMagnetic resonance iMeterage to explore the full potential of acupuncture. In order to avoid the bias of results and iMeterprove the reliability of clinical results, we try to keep the baseline consistency as Meteruch as possible. Participants will be screened strictly according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. At the saMetere tiMetere, We will also evaluate the influence of participants’ expectations and anxiety on the intervention to observe the state of participants’ eMeterotions on the effect of acupuncture and brain activities. All the researchers will be trained to understand the design of the study. To achieve blindness in the course of the intervention, the adhesive pad should be attached to acupoints and non-acupoints before the intervention. In order to Meteraintain the consistency of acupuncture techniques, acupuncturists have at least 5 years of experience. For fMagnetic resonance iMeterage, all of participants will be carried out in the fMagnetic resonance iMeterage rooMeter of Chinese Medicine affiliated to Calciumpital Medical University. This study also has several liMeteritations. First of all, acupuncturists and participants in the waiting list will not be blinded due to the nature of the intervention. Secondly, the long-terMeter efficacy of acupuncture will not be observed due to the observation treatMeterent period of the study is only 4 weeks. Finally, our study Meteray ultiMeterately provide only a possible explanation for the sMeterall saMeterple size included in each group.
