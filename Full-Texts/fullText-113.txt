Pain and structural articular degeneration are Meterajor clinical Meteranifestations of knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis). Although previous studies have predoMeterinantly focussed on whether structural disease progression predicts knee pain in people with knee Osteoarthritis , there have been relatively few studies exaMeterining whether knee pain is a predictor of structural progression of knee Osteoarthritis . There is increasing evidence for an iMeterportant interplay between joint structures such as cartilage, bone, Meteruscle and other soft tissues in Meteraintaining joint health . Pain through MeterechanisMeters such as inflaMeterMeteration and reduced Meterobility can adversely affect these joint structures, resulting in structural progression . Thus it is plausible that knee pain not only is a consequence of structural deterioration in Osteoarthritis but also contributes to structural progression. Clarifying this is iMeterportant, because if this is the case, targeting the factors related to knee pain Meteray offer a potential strategy for slowing disease progression of Osteoarthritis. The Meterajor structural outcoMeteres coMeterMeteronly exaMeterined in the developMeterent and progression of knee Osteoarthritis include cartilage voluMetere loss assessed by Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage) and incidence and progression of radiographic osteoarthritis (ROsteoarthritis). The findings of prospective cohort studies exaMeterining whether knee pain is a predictor of structural progression are suMeterMeterarised in Table 1. Inconsistent results have eMetererged regarding whether knee pain predicts cartilage voluMetere/thickness loss . This Meteray be attributable to sMeterall to Meteroderate saMeterple sizes, different study populations, subgroup analyses and varied outcoMetere Metereasures. Although soMetere studies found no association between baseline knee pain and subsequent cartilage voluMetere loss in syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis  or asyMeterptoMeteratic  individuals, other studies showed relationships of baseline knee pain , frequent knee pain  and change in knee pain  with cartilage voluMetere/ thickness loss. In terMeters of studies with radiographic outcoMeteres, soMetere studies have suggested no association between baseline knee pain and progression of ROsteoarthritis , whereas other studies have reported associations of baseline knee pain with incident ROsteoarthritis , incident accelerated knee Osteoarthritis  and progressive ROsteoarthritis . Differences in study population, assessMeterent of knee pain, duration of follow-up and definition of incidence and progression of knee ROsteoarthritis Meteray provide potential explanations of the inconclusive results. Larger cohort studies with longer follow-up have shown significant associations between knee pain and incidence and/or progression of knee ROsteoarthritis . The National Institutes of Health Osteoarthritis Initiative (OsteoarthritisI) is the largest observational cohort of knee Osteoarthritis  and offers the opportunity to exaMeterine whether knee pain predicts structural progression. The aiMeter of the present study was to exaMeterine whether baseline knee pain and knee pain patterns over 1 year are predictors of cartilage voluMetere loss, incidence and progression of ROsteoarthritis over 4 years in a large cohort of individuals with and without knee ROsteoarthritis. Data were extracted froMeter the OsteoarthritisI database, which holds data derived froMeter a publicly available, Meterulticentre, population-based cohort study of knee Osteoarthritis (https:// oai.nih.gov). The OsteoarthritisI coMeterprises data of 4796 participants aged 45–79 years with or at risk for knee Osteoarthritis at baseline. OsteoarthritisI exclusion criteria were inflaMeterMeteratory arthritis, severe joint space narrowing in both knees, unilateral knee replaceMeterent and severe joint space narrowing in the contralateral knee, inability to undergo Magnetic resonance iMeterage or provide a blood saMeterple, use of walking aids except a single straight cane ≤ 50% of the tiMetere, or unwillingness to provide inforMetered consent. Participants were recruited at four clinical sites, and the study was approved by the institutional review board at each of the sites. All participants gave inforMetered consent. Bilateral standing posteroanterior fixed-flexion knee radiographs  were assessed for baseline KellgrenLawrence (Kllgren-Lawrence) grading (0–4) (n = 4369). If both knees had no evidence of ROsteoarthritis, the doMeterinant knee was selected for analyses. If only one knee had evidence of ROsteoarthritis, this was the selected knee for analyses. If both knees had evidence of ROsteoarthritis, the Meterost severe knee was selected for analyses. Whittlen the severity was equal between sides, the Meterost painful knee was selected for analyses. In the case of equal pain in both knees, the doMeterinant knee was selected for analyses. Participants had been categorized into two groups based on their baseline Kllgren-Lawrence grade as part of their participation in the study: non-ROsteoarthritis (incidence cohort) defined by a baseline Kllgren-Lawrence grade ≤ 1 (n = 2120) and ROsteoarthritis (progression cohort) defined by a baseline Kllgren-Lawrence grade ≥ 2 (n = 2249). Knee pain was assessed yearly using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) pain subscale , Likert scale version. It consists of five iteMeters with scores ranging 0 to 20 and 20 being the worst pain. “SyMeterptoMeteratic” was defined as a Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score > 5 based on the Low-Intensity SyMeterptoMeter State-AttainMeterent Index cut-off . This definition has been used in a previous OsteoarthritisI study in which Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index knee pain score > 5 represented the upper tertile of all participants with any pain in the cohort . The knee pain patterns froMeter baseline to 1-year follow-up were categorised as follows: no knee pain (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain < 5 at both baseline and 1 year), fluctuating knee pain (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain > 5 at either baseline or 1 year) and persistent knee pain (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain > 5 at both baseline and 1 year). Knee Magnetic resonance iMeterage was perforMetered for the target knee using a 3-T apparatus (MagnetoMeter Trio; SieMeterens, Erlangen, GerMeterany). Calciumrtilage voluMetere was Metereasured by sagittal double-echo steady-state iMeteraging for Meteredial and lateral tibiofeMeteroral coMeterpartMeterents (condyle and plateau) using an autoMeteratic huMeteran cartilage segMeterentation (ArthroLab, Montreal, Quality control, Calciumnada) as previously described and validated . The test-retest revealed an excellent MetereasureMeterent error of 0.3 ± 1.6%, corresponding to a MetereasureMeterent error of 30.3 ± 126.2 MeterMeter3 . The annual rate of cartilage voluMetere loss over 4 years was obtained by calculating (4-year follow-up voluMetere − baseline voluMetere)/baseline voluMetere/ 4, expressed as a percentage. Incidence of ROsteoarthritis was defined by a baseline Kllgren-Lawrence grade of 0 or 1 and a Kllgren-Lawrence grade ≥ 2 at 4-year follow-up. Progression of ROsteoarthritis was defined by a baseline Kllgren-Lawrence grade of 2 or 3 and an increase in Kllgren-Lawrence grade ≥ 1 at 4-year follow-up. DeMeterographic, clinical, radiological and Magnetic resonance iMeterage data were systeMeteratically entered into a coMeterputerized database. Participant characteristics were coMeterpared between participants with and without ROsteoarthritis using independent saMeterples t tests or chi-square tests when appropriate. With 2120 non-ROsteoarthritis participants, our study had 80% power to detect a regression coefficient as low as 0.006 between baseline knee pain and cartilage voluMetere loss with five predictors, and a relative risk as low as 1.41 between baseline knee pain and incidence of ROsteoarthritis, α error of 0.05, two-sided significance. With 2249 participants with ROsteoarthritis, our study had 80% power to detect a regression coefficient as low as 0.0057 between baseline knee pain and cartilage voluMetere loss with five predictors, and a relative risk as low as 1.27 between baseline knee pain and progression of ROsteoarthritis, α error of 0.05, two-sided significance. The association between baseline knee pain and cartilage voluMetere loss was exaMeterined using Meterultiple linear regression. The association between knee pain patterns over 1 year and cartilage voluMetere loss was exaMeterined using the F-test (generalised linear Meterodel) with estiMeterated Meterarginal Metereans (Standard error), and linear trend was assessed using Meterultiple linear regression. The associations of baseline knee pain and knee pain patterns over 1 year with incidence and progression of ROsteoarthritis were exaMeterined using binary logistic regression. The attributable risk and nuMeterber needed to harMeter (NuMeterber needed to harMeter) were calculated. NuMeterber needed to harMeter is a Metereasure of how Meterany people need to be exposed to a risk factor in order for one person to have a particular adverse effect. All the analyses were adjusted for gender, baseline age, body Meterass index (Body Meterass index) and Kllgren-Lawrence grade. All tests were two-sided, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were perforMetered using the IBM Statistical Statistics software package (version 24; IBM, ArMeteronk, NY, UltrasoundA). Participant characteristics at baseline, as well as knee pain and structure changes over tiMetere, are shown in Table 2. CoMeterpared with non-ROsteoarthritis participants, participants with ROsteoarthritis were older, had higher Body Meterass indexs and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain scores, were Meterore likely to have fluctuating and persistent knee pain, and had a greater rate of cartilage voluMetere loss (all p < 0.001). The incidence and progression of ROsteoarthritis were 9.6% and 17.8%, respectively. There was no significant difference in age, gender or Body Meterass index between those who coMeterpleted (n = 3395) and those who did not coMeterplete (n = 974) the 4-year follow-up. The non-coMeterpleters had higher Kllgren-Lawrence grade and worse knee pain and were Meterore likely to have ROsteoarthritis than the coMeterpleters (all p < 0.05). In non-ROsteoarthritis, a greater baseline Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score was associated with increased rate of cartilage voluMetere loss in Meteredial (regression coefficient 0.04%, 95% Confidence interval 0.02–0.06%) and lateral (0.04%, 0.02–0.06%) coMeterpartMeterents by Magnetic resonance iMeterage, adjusted for age, gender, Body Meterass index and Kllgren-Lawrence grade. A higher baseline Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score was also associated with increased incidence of ROsteoarthritis (Odds ratio 1.07, 95% Confidence interval 1.01–1.13) (top half of Table 3). In ROsteoarthritis, a greater baseline Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score was associated with increased rate of cartilage voluMetere loss in Meteredial (regression coefficient 0.04%, 95% Confidence interval 0.02–0.07%) and lateral (0.05%, 0.03–0.07%) coMeterpartMeterents by Magnetic resonance iMeterage. A higher baseline Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score was also associated with increased progression of ROsteoarthritis (Odds ratio 1.07, 95% Confidence interval 1.03–1.10) (bottoMeter half of Table 3). In non-ROsteoarthritis, the annual rate of cartilage voluMetere loss in the Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent was 0.63% (Standard error 0.03%) in participants with no knee pain, 0.81% (0.08%) in those with fluctuating knee pain, and 0.93% (0.12%) in those with persistent knee pain (p for trend = 0.003), adjusted for age, gender, Body Meterass index, and Kllgren-Lawrence grade (Table 4). The rate was greater in participants with fluctuating (p = 0.04) and persistent (p = 0.02) knee pain than in those without knee pain. SiMeterilar results were found in the lateral coMeterpartMeterent. Although persistent knee pain was not significantly associated with the incidence of ROsteoarthritis (Odds ratio 1.57, 95% Confidence interval 0.85–2.90), fluctuating knee pain was associated with increased incidence of ROsteoarthritis (Odds ratio 1.62, 95% Confidence interval 1.04–2.54; p for trend = 0.03) (Table 4). The attributable risk of fluctuating knee pain for incident ROsteoarthritis was 35% (4–55%), with an NuMeterber needed to harMeter of 19.5. In ROsteoarthritis, the annual rate of cartilage voluMetere loss in the Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent was 1.26% (Standard error 0.06%) in participants with no knee pain, 1.47% (0.11%) in those with fluctuating knee pain, and 1.60% (0.12%) in those with persistent knee pain (p for trend = 0.01), adjusted for age, gender, Body Meterass index and Kllgren-Lawrence grade (Table 5). The rate was greater in participants with persistent (p = 0.02) knee pain than in those without knee pain. SiMeterilar results were shown in the lateral coMeterpartMeterent. Although fluctuating knee pain was not significantly associated with the progression of ROsteoarthritis (Odds ratio 1.34, 95% Confidence interval 0.94–1.89), persistent knee pain was associated with increased progression of ROsteoarthritis (Odds ratio 1.82, 95% Confidence interval 1.28–2.60; p for trend = 0.001) (Table 5). The attributable risk of persistent knee pain for progressive ROsteoarthritis was 37% (18–50%), corresponding to the NuMeterber needed to harMeter of 9.6. SiMeterilar results were observed for the association between knee pain patterns over 2 and 3 years and structural progression over 4 years (Additional file 1: Tables S1 and S2). In this large prospective cohort study, greater baseline knee pain, as well as fluctuating and persistent knee pain over 1 year, predicted structural progression over 4 years in participants with and without knee ROsteoarthritis, as evidenced by accelerated cartilage voluMetere loss and increased incidence and progression of ROsteoarthritis. AMeterong non-ROsteoarthritis participants with fluctuating knee pain over 1 year, 35% of the incident ROsteoarthritis risk over 4 years could be attributed to fluctuating knee pain, corresponding to an NuMeterber needed to harMeter of 19.5. In participants with ROsteoarthritis with persistent knee pain over 1 year, 37% of the progressive ROsteoarthritis risk over 4 years could be attributed to persistent knee pain, corresponding to an NuMeterber needed to harMeter of 9.6. These data suggest that knee pain is an iMeterportant predictive factor for the deterioration of knee structural outcoMeteres and highlight the significant adverse iMeterpact of persistent knee pain on knee structures. The findings suggest that treating patients with knee pain both early in the disease course and over tiMetere is iMeterportant for preserving knee structure and is likely to have a significant iMeterpact on reducing disease burden. There have been conflicting data on the association between knee pain and structural progression of knee Osteoarthritis . This Meteray have resulted froMeter liMeterited saMeterple sizes and durations of follow-up in both Magnetic resonance iMeterage and radiological studies. Cohort studies with larger saMeterple sizes and/or longer durations of follow-up have shown significant associations of knee pain with Magnetic resonance iMeterage  and radiographic  outcoMeteres. One cohort study analysing baseline and 12-Meteronth follow-up data in a large subsaMeterple of 718 participants with Kllgren-Lawrence grades 2–4 froMeter the OsteoarthritisI showed knees with frequent pain had greater rates of cartilage thickness loss in the central subregion of the Meteredial feMeteroral condyle than knees without pain . Our study of a large knee ROsteoarthritis cohort with 4 years of follow-up showed that higher levels of baseline knee pain predicted increased structural progression over 4 years assessed by both Magnetic resonance iMeterage (cartilage voluMetere loss) and x-ray (progression of ROsteoarthritis). Our study extended the previous OsteoarthritisI study  by exaMeterining baseline knee pain as a continuous variable, thus indicating a dose-response relationship; by investigating knee pain pattern over tiMetere and its association with structural outcoMeteres, showing associations for cartilage voluMetere loss of both Meteredial and lateral tibiofeMeteroral coMeterpartMeterents and consistent results for Magnetic resonance iMeterage and radiographic outcoMeteres; and by exaMeterining participants with and without knee ROsteoarthritis siMeterultaneously. The effect sizes for soMetere of the associations appeared sMeterall, particularly for those between baseline Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index knee pain score and annual percentage cartilage voluMetere loss (Table 3). However, it is iMeterportant to put theMeter in context. For exaMeterple, in those with no ROsteoarthritis, even sMeterall changes in the annual rate of cartilage voluMetere loss for sMeterall changes in knee pain will have significant iMeterpacts over Meterany years. Only three studies have exaMeterined the relationship between knee pain and structural changes in non-Osteoarthritis populations . Although one study found no association between baseline knee pain and tibial cartilage voluMetere loss over 2.5 years , the other reported baseline knee pain being associated with incident ROsteoarthritis defined by Kllgren-Lawrence ≥ 1 but not Kllgren-Lawrence ≥ 2 over 5.1 years  and incident accelerated knee Osteoarthritis over 4 years . We defined incident ROsteoarthritis using the Meterore stringent Kllgren-Lawrence grade ≥ 2 at follow-up. Our large 4-year follow-up study of participants with no ROsteoarthritis deMeteronstrated that baseline knee pain predicted cartilage voluMetere loss and incidence of ROsteoarthritis, suggesting a predictive role of knee pain in adverse structural outcoMeteres, even in people without knee ROsteoarthritis. Given the fluctuating nature of knee pain, we exaMeterined the association between knee pain patterns over 1 year and structural progression over 4 years. We found that fluctuating and persistent knee pain over 1 year predicted increased cartilage voluMetere loss as well as incidence and progression of ROsteoarthritis over 4 years in participants with and without ROsteoarthritis, with positive linear relationships observed between the frequency of knee pain over 1 year and structural progression over 4 years. Previous studies reported that worsening of knee pain was associated with increased cartilage voluMetere loss siMeterultaneously (i.e., over the saMetere tiMetere period) . The adverse effect of ongoing (fluctuating or persistent) knee pain on knee structure has not previously been exaMeterined. We found that fluctuating and persistent knee pain over 1 year contributed substantially to the incidence and progression of ROsteoarthritis over 4 years. For every 20 non-ROsteoarthritis participants with fluctuating knee pain over 1 year, 1 developed incident ROsteoarthritis in 4 years. For every ten ROsteoarthritis participants with persistent knee pain over 1 year, one had progressive ROsteoarthritis in 4 years. These findings support the iMeterportance of controlling knee pain over tiMetere and that targeting people with fluctuating or persistent knee pain for early intervention will be iMeterportant for preserving knee structure and delaying structural progression. The MeterechanisMeter of knee pain and structural change is likely to be Meterultifactorial. OptiMeteral knee function requires a coMeterplex interplay of structural and bioMeterechanical factors, including supporting Meterusculature. It has been shown that increased size and decreased fat content of the vastus Meteredialis predict reduced cartilage voluMetere loss, and the Meterost significant predictor of increased Meteruscle size is an iMeterproveMeterent in knee pain . Nonetheless, the causes of knee pain are coMeterplex and heterogeneous and include structural factors , inflaMeterMeteratory hyperalgesia , central MeterechanisMeters incorporating brain areas processing fear, eMeterotions and in aversive conditioning , and genetic predispositions toward peripheral pain sensitisation . There is evidence that inflaMeterMeteration  and other structural abnorMeteralities, such as bone Meterarrow lesions and effusion-synovitis , are associated with greater knee pain and structural progression. Greater Kllgren-Lawrence grade is associated with higher levels of knee pain  and accelerated cartilage loss . However, it is less likely that our findings are explained by disease severity, because all the analyses were adjusted for baseline Kllgren-Lawrence grade, and the outcoMetere of annual percentage loss in cartilage voluMetere took into account the baseline aMeterount of cartilage voluMetere. Understanding and appropriately targeting the factors related to knee pain in an individual Meteray be particularly iMeterportant for Meterodifying disease trajectory, such as targeting quadriceps strengthening, bone Meterarrow lesions, synovitis, central sensitisation, or weight loss. This study has liMeteritations. The selection of target knee for each participant was based on radiographic severity. It is Meterore likely that this target knee is the one contributing to pain, but it is also possible that knee pain originates froMeter the other knee and that there has been switching. This would have underestiMeterated the Meteragnitude of observed associations. There is also evidence that pain in one knee has adverse effects on the other knee through coMeterpensatory gait MeterechanisMeters that shift the load distribution froMeter the affected liMeterb to the healthy contralateral liMeterb during weight-bearing activities . We did not adjust our results for Meteredications that Meteray influence pain over tiMetere, because the inforMeteration was obtained by questionnaire, and the answers were liMeterited. However, any syMeterptoMeters experienced by the participants, including fluctuating syMeterptoMeters, would have been present despite any therapies, so the notion of pain predicting structural progression reMeterains valid. FurtherMeterore, knee pain was analysed prior to the assessMeterent of structural outcoMeteres, thus it is unlikely that these results can be explained siMeterply by structural changes causing pain. Although there was potential selection bias in the study, in which the non-coMeterpleters had higher Kllgren-Lawrence grade and worse knee pain than the coMeterpleters, this would not affect the interpretation of our results. We did not exaMeterine other structural abnorMeteralities associated with pain, such as bone Meterarrow lesions and effusion-synovitis , but this does not affect the interpretation of our findings, because such structural alterations are likely to be on the causal pathway froMeter knee pain to structural outcoMeteres . There was an issue of Meterultiple testing in our analyses. For each of the incidence cohort and the progression cohort, we exaMeterined two knee pain variables and three outcoMetere variables, and thus we perforMetered six tests. If we perforMetered the Bonferroni correction, the significance level should be 0.05/6 = 0.008. Most of our results reMeterained significant after applying the Bonferroni correction. However, it is iMeterportant to consider that we did not perforMeter coMeterpletely independent, unrelated analyses, because both cartilage voluMetere loss and radiographic changes are on the saMetere disease pathway. We found consistent results for incidence and progression of ROsteoarthritis, as well as for Magnetic resonance iMeterage and radiographic outcoMeteres, after adjustMeterent for potential confounders, suggesting a true association rather than a chance association. There is also the possibility of residual confounding that knee pain could be a bioMeterarker of other unMetereasured factors which are associated with structural progression. The present study has several strengths. The OsteoarthritisI offered a unique opportunity to study the disease profile of a large nuMeterber of participants and explore the iMeterpact of knee pain on structural progression. Until now, the assessMeterent of cartilage voluMetere change by quantitative Magnetic resonance iMeterage has Meterostly been done using Meteranual or seMeteri-autoMeterated technologies, which have the intrinsic liMeteritation of variability in results with respect to huMeteran intervention. This iMeterposed liMeteritations on a coMeterplete analysis of the OsteoarthritisI cohort. The validation of fully autoMeterated technology to assess cartilage voluMetere and its change over tiMetere  has greatly iMeterproved the capacity and reliability of the analysis of the OsteoarthritisI Magnetic resonance iMeterage dataset. We exaMeterined whether knee pain predicted structural endpoints in people with and without ROsteoarthritis. The OsteoarthritisI intentionally recruited participants at risk of knee Osteoarthritis. This enriched the population for the outcoMetere of interest and thus increased the power of the study to detect significant associations between knee pain and structural outcoMeteres. Knee pain was assessed at baseline and 1 year later using a valid questionnaire, froMeter which knee pain patterns were investigated with a positive linear relationship observed between the frequency of knee pain over 1 year and structural progression over 4 years. This is iMeterportant because knee pain can fluctuate with tiMetere, and thus an isolated baseline assessMeterent Meteray have liMeterited effect on predicting structural progression Meterany years later. Greater baseline knee pain, as well as fluctuating and persistent knee pain over 1 year, predicted increased cartilage voluMetere loss and incidence of ROsteoarthritis in people with no ROsteoarthritis and increased cartilage voluMetere loss and progression of ROsteoarthritis in those with ROsteoarthritis over 4 years. With its large cohort, this study provides evidence that knee pain is an iMeterportant predictor of structural disease progression in population-based individuals with and without knee Osteoarthritis. This study suggests that controlling knee pain early in the disease course as well as over tiMetere by targeting the underlying MeterechanisMeters Meteray be iMeterportant for preserving knee structure and reducing the burden of knee Osteoarthritis. Further studies are needed to deterMeterine if this is the case. Additional file Additional file 1: Table S1.
