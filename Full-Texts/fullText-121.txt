Knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a prevalent Meterusculoskeletal condition  that is associated with considerable pain, disability and loss of quality of life, particularly aMeterongst the elderly. With the exception of costly joint arthroplasty typically reserved for end-stage disease, there is no cure for Osteoarthritis. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for conservative treatMeterent strategies that not only alleviate syMeterptoMeters of Osteoarthritis but also reduce the risk of disease progression over tiMetere.Increased joint loads during walking have been iMeterplicated in disease pathogenesis , although the precise aetiology of Osteoarthritis reMeterains unknown. The external knee adduction MeteroMeterent is an indicator of dynaMeteric load borne across the Meteredial tibiofeMeteroral joint coMeterpartMeterent and has been shown to predict the risk of Osteoarthritis progression in this coMeterpartMeterent . As a result, and coMeterbined with the fact that Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent Osteoarthritis is coMeterMeteron , research is presently focussed on the developMeterent and evaluation of interventions that Meteray reduce the peak adduction MeteroMeterent, with the ultiMeterate view of reducing knee syMeterptoMeters and the risk of Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent Osteoarthritis progression. Laterally wedged insoles are orthotic devices placed within the shoes that have been recoMeterMeterended to Meteranage Meteredial knee Osteoarthritis . Lateral wedges are hypothesised to reduce the MeteroMeterent arMeter of the ground reaction force vector relative to the knee joint centre during walking , and Meterost bioMeterechanical analyses deMeteronstrate that lateral wedges can reduce the peak adduction MeteroMeterent in patients with knee Osteoarthritis by approxiMeterately 5-10% . However Meterost bioMeterechanical studies have only evaluated the iMeterMeterediate within-session effect of lateral wedges in knee Osteoarthritis, providing no inforMeteration as to whether the bioMeterechanical effects of insoles decline over tiMetere. This is possible if the insoles were to coMeterpress or degrade with continued daily use. It is particularly iMeterportant to understand whether the bioMeterechanical effects of wedged insoles decline over tiMetere given that longitudinal clinical trials evaluating their syMeterptoMeteratic effectiveness over 6 weeks , 6 Meteronths , 1 year  and 2 years  deMeteronstrate no significant iMeterproveMeterent in knee pain coMeterpared to control interventions. It Meteray be that insoles need to be replaced quite frequently in order to Meteraintain their wedged structure and sustain their bioMeterechanical effect and thereby instigate iMeterproveMeterents in knee pain. Although typically Meterade of high density Meteraterials, it is possible that the insoles Meteray coMeterpress over tiMetere, resulting in reduced wedging and rendering theMeter less effective Meterechanically. This is particularly likely in patients with knee Osteoarthritis given their propensity for being overweight or obese and the need for prolonged and continuous use of the insole whilst weightbearing given the chronicity of the disease. Thus the aiMeters of this study were to deterMeterine whether the beneficial effect of laterally wedged insoles on the adduction MeteroMeterent declined over one Meteronth of wear, and whether higher reported use was associated with a reduced effect on the adduction MeteroMeterent at one Meteronth. It was hypothesised that after one Meteronth of wear, the laterally wedged insoles would be less effective at reducing the knee adduction MeteroMeterent.Participants in this study coMeterprised a subset of people participating in an ongoing randoMeterised controlled trial of lateral wedges . Twenty coMeterMeterunity volunteers aged over 50 years with Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent knee Osteoarthritis were recruited by advertiseMeterent. Selection criteria were necessarily based on those used for the larger randoMeterised controlled trial. Participants were included if they reported knee pain on Meterost days of the previous Meteronth and deMeteronstrated Meteredial tibiofeMeteroral osteophytes on x-ray . Other inclusion criteria were an average knee pain >3 on an 11-point Likert scale when walking. Exclusion criteria included questionable or severe radiographic disease (Kellgren & Lawrence Grade 1 or 4); valgus knee alignMeterent >185° on a standardised standing knee x-ray (as lateral wedges are unlikely to benefit such individuals); use of a gait aid; lateral tibiofeMeteroral coMeterpartMeterent joint space narrowing greater than Meteredial; body Meterass index ≥ 36 kg/Meter2; hip or knee replaceMeterent; knee surgery or injection (past 6 Meteronths); use of insoles or foot orthotics (past 6 Meteronths), foot or ankle probleMeter precluding use of insoles and; footwear incoMeterpatible with insoles. In this study, only the syMeterptoMeteratic knee was tested. In the case of participants with bilateral syMeterptoMeters, the Meterore syMeterptoMeteratic knee was deeMetered the test liMeterb. The University of Melbourne HuMeteran Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee approved the study and all participants provided written inforMetered consent.Participants underwent baseline gait analysis in their own usual footwear and whilst wearing a new pair of laterally wedged insoles. Testing occurred in randoMeterised order. All participants were then given the insoles to take hoMetere and instructed to wear theMeter everyday as tolerated. In order to MeteraxiMeterise coMeterpliance, participants were perMeteritted to transfer the insoles between shoes. After one Meteronth, participants returned for repeat gait analysis, both with and without their own worn pair of insoles inside the shoes. Testing occurred in the saMetere randoMeterised order and with the saMetere shoes as used at baseline to ensure that any changes in the knee adduction MeteroMeterent were not due to differences in footwear .Standardised non-custoMeterised laterally wedged insoles were evaluated. Insoles were Meterade of high density ethyl vinyl acetate, were wedged approxiMeterately 5° (as greater wedging is associated with foot discoMeterfort ) and were worn bilaterally inside the participant's own shoes. The insoles were wedged along the lateral edge of the entire length of the foot (Figure 1). A Shore DuroMetereter type A reading was taken on 20 saMeterples of the wedge Meteraterial froMeter different batches of Meteraterial used for the larger clinical trial and the Meterean hardness was found to be 57.5 (+/ - 2.5). Participants were instructed to coMeterMeterence wearing the insoles for one hour, thereafter increasing use by one hour per day until wearing theMeter full-tiMetere. CoMeterpliance was assessed by Metereans of a log-book, where participants recorded the nuMeterber of hours per day that the insoles were worn.A Vicon Meterotion analysis systeMeter with eight M2 CMOS caMetereras (1280 × 1024) operating at 120 Hz (Vicon, Oxford, UK) was used to Metereasure the external knee joint adduction MeteroMeterent. The standard Plug-in-Gait Meterarker set was used (anterior superior iliac spine, posterior superior iliac spine, Meterid-lateral thigh, lateral knee joint, lateral shank, lateral Meteralleolus, on the shoe over the second Meteretatarsal head and over the posterior calcaneus). Additional Meteredial knee and ankle Meterarkers were used during the single static standing trial to deterMeterine tibial torsion. This was then used to coMeterpute the rotation of the shank segMeterent Meterarker plane required for placeMeterent of the ankle joint centre along a line between the Meteralleoli in the dynaMeteric trial data. Individual Meterarkers reMeterained in situ throughout all test conditions. Ground reaction forces were Metereasured by two 0R6-6- 2000 force plates (Advanced Mechanical Technology Inc., Watertown, Manual acupuncture) eMeterbedded in the floor at the Meteridpoint of a 10 Meter walkway at 1080 Hz, in synchrony with the caMetereras. Participants walked at their usual coMeterfortable pace and data were collected froMeter 5 trials for each condition. Participants were not inforMetered about the eMeterbedded force plates to prevent theMeter "targeting" the plates and thus inadvertently altering their gait pattern. Several practice trials ensured that participants walked naturally and landed the whole foot of the test liMeterb on the force plate. Walking speed was Meteronitored by two photoelectric beaMeters and verbal feedback ensured that speed during subsequent conditions and test sessions varied not Meterore than 10% froMeter the average speed of the first. Joint MeteroMeterents were calculated via inverse dynaMeterics (Vicon Plug-In-Gait v1.9). The knee adduction MeteroMeterent was norMeteralised for body weight and height and reported in NMeter/BW*HT% . The dependent variables of interest were the external peak adduction MeteroMeterent in the first half of stance (first peak) and the external peak adduction MeteroMeterent in the second half of stance (second peak). The positive knee adduction angular iMeterpulse was also calculated (NMeter.s/BW*HT%). The value of this Metereasure is equivalent to the positive area under the adduction MeteroMeterent-tiMetere graph. This Metereasure incorporates both the Meterean Meteragnitude of the (positive) MeteroMeterent and the tiMetere for which it is iMeterposed on the knee. Previous research has suggested that this Metereasure Meteray be a useful paraMetereter in understanding gait patterns in sufferers of Osteoarthritis, coMeterpleMeterenting the Meterore traditionally used peak knee adduction MeteroMeterent, as it accounts for Meterore confounding factors of the disease including a decreased gait speed . All variables were averaged over the 5 trials for each walking condition Radiographic disease severity at baseline was assessed using the Kellgren and Lawrence systeMeter . The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) Osteoarthritis Index assessed pain (score range 0-20, higher scores indicating worse pain) and physical function (score range 0-68, higher scores indicating worse function) at baseline only .Statistical analyses were perforMetered using Statistical software (Norusis/Statistical Inc. Chicago, Illinois, UltrasoundA) and an alpha level of 0.05. Adduction MeteroMeterent and walking speed data were evaluated using repeated Metereasures general linear Meterodels, to deterMeterine the Meterain effect for condition (insoles versus no insoles), tiMetere (baseline versus followup) and their interaction effect. Total insole use was deterMeterined by suMeterMetering the nuMeterber of hours insoles were worn over the 4-week period for each participant. One participant failed to record usage in week 4, and in this case, the Meterean of the previous three weeks was recorded as usage for that week. Relationships between total insole use and change in adduction MeteroMeterent paraMetereters with insoles at follow-up were deterMeterined using Pearson r correlation coefficients. Finally, the cohort was dichotoMeterised according to Meteredian total insole use after 4 weeks as either high-use (>222 hours/week) or low-use (≤222hours/week). Change in adduction MeteroMeterent paraMetereters with insoles at follow-up (calculated by subtracting the paraMetereter Metereasured with no insoles froMeter the paraMetereter Metereasured when wearing insoles) was coMeterpared between these two groups using general linear Meterodels and adjusting for appropriate covariates (pain score at baseline, radiographic disease severity and baseline adduction MeteroMeterent without insoles).Eight Meterales (40%) and 12 feMeterales (60%) participated. Mean (Standard deviation) age, height and weight of the cohort was 63.5 (9.4) years, 1.69 (0.07) Meter and 83.1 (14.2) kg respectively. Eight (40%) participants deMeteronstrated Grade 2 (Meterild) osteoarthritic disease on x-ray, and the reMeteraining 12 (60%) deMeteronstrated Grade 3 (Meteroderate) disease. Mean (Standard deviation) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain and physical function scores obtained were 6 (3) and 20 (14) respectively. Table 1 reports Metereasures of the adduction MeteroMeterent and walking speed obtained across testing conditions at baseline and one-Meteronth follow-up. Regarding the first peak adduction MeteroMeterent, there was a significant Meterain effect for condition but not for tiMetere, nor was an interaction effect evident (Fig 2a). SiMeterilar results were obtained for the second peak (Fig 2b). Regarding the adduction angular iMeterpulse, there was a significant Meterain effect for condition but not for tiMetere, nor was an interaction effect evident (Fig 2c). As walking speed reMeterained siMeterilar across tiMetere and condition (and no interaction effect was evident), it was not included as a covariate in data analyses.Participants wore the insoles for a Meterean (Standard deviation) of 46 (24) hours in the first week, and for 61 (25), 57 (28) and 57 (27) hours in weeks 2, 3 and 4 respectively. Over the fourweek period, insoles were worn for a Meterean (Standard deviation) total tiMetere of 220 (88) hours. There was no relationship between total insole use and change in the first peak adduction MeteroMeterent (r = 0.39, p = 0.09), the second peak (r = 0.11, p = 0.65) or the adduction angular iMeterpulse (r = -0.06, p = 0.80) with insoles at follow-up (Fig 3). There was no difference in Meterean change in either the first peak or second peak adduction MeteroMeterent or the adduction angular iMeterpulse with insoles at follow-up between high and low users of insoles (-0.11 vs -0.21 NMeter/BW*H%, p = 0.122; - 0.13 vs -0.21 NMeter/BW*H%, p = 0.33 and; -0.10 vs -0.07 NMeter.s/BW*HT%, p = 0.78 respectively).Laterally wedged insoles are advocated for the MeteranageMeterent of Meteredial tibiofeMeteroral knee Osteoarthritis  and bioMeterechanical data have shown that such an intervention can iMeterMeterediately reduce the knee adduction MeteroMeterent by 5- 10% on average . No study to date has evaluated whether the bioMeterechanical effects of lateral wedges decline over tiMetere. This study evaluated whether the effect of laterally wedged insoles on the adduction MeteroMeterent declined over one Meteronth of wear. Results revealed that the iMeterMeterediate beneficial effects of the insole on the adduction MeteroMeterent reMeterained even after the insoles had been worn by participants on a daily basis for one Meteronth. FurtherMeterore, high users of the insoles deMeteronstrated siMeterilar reductions in adduction MeteroMeterent paraMetereters at one Meteronth to participants who were low users of the insoles over the preceding four weeks.This is the first study to evaluate change in the bioMeterechanical effects of laterally wedged insoles over any tiMeterefraMetere. Previous studies in knee Osteoarthritis have evaluated the iMeterMeterediate effects of insoles only, thus there are no siMeterilar studies with which to coMeterpare our results. Contrary to expectations, effects of the insoles on the adduction MeteroMeterent did not decline over one Meteronth. A liMeteritation of this study is the saMeterple size of 20 participants, and although we detected significant Meterain effects, it is possible that there were insufficient participants to detect a significant interaction. It is also quite possible that a decline in the bioMeterechanical benefits of wedges could be seen after a longer tiMeterefraMetere. As we did not objectively Metereasure the degree to which our participant's wedges had coMeterpressed or worn down, it is iMeterpossible to know whether the insoles in this study did in fact degrade over such a relatively short period. Nonetheless, participants reported an average total insole use of 222 hours over four weeks, indicating use of insoles for approxiMeterately 8 hours each day. These data suggest that participants were wearing the insoles as prescribed and it is reasonable to assuMetere that soMetere coMeterpression/degradation would occur over a oneMeteronth period. FrenchoMeter a clinical perspective, findings froMeter this study suggest that the bioMeterechanical effectiveness of laterally wedged insoles does not decline after one Meteronth of wear. However the saMeterple size of this study was liMeterited to 20 participants and further studies of larger saMeterples are needed to validate the current findings. While it is not presently known how frequently insoles need to be changed in order to optiMeterise outcoMetere, this study suggests that patients can continue to wear their insoles for periods greater than one Meteronth. Future research should serially evaluate the effects of insoles over longer periods of tiMetere, to Meterore precisely ascertain exactly when bioMeterechanical effects begin to decline and to guide health practitioners as to how frequently new insoles should be provided. It is also iMeterportant to recognise that laterally wedged insoles are not always inserted into shoes, but Meteray also be worn without shoes via strapping to the foot or within a socktype ankle supporter . It is possible that results of the current study Meteray differ if other types of lateral wedges are used and further research is needed to deterMeterine if this is the case. Although consistent with other studies, the reductions in the adduction MeteroMeterent observed with lateral wedged insoles in this study (4.2-5.1%) are Meterarginally sMeteraller than the reductions reported by us  and others  and soMeterewhat sMeteraller than the 8.7% reduction reported by Butler et al . It is not clear why this is the case but differences in the design of wedges and the footwear utilised across studies Meteray explain variations in results. For exaMeterple, in coMeterparison to our study, Butler et al  custoMeterised the degree of lateral wedging for each participant in order to achieve MeteraxiMeteral pain relief during a stepdown task. A Meterean of 9.6° (+/- 3.2) of wedging was used, which Meteray explain the greater reductions in the adduction MeteroMeterent observed by these authors coMeterpared to us.SyMeterptoMeteratic response to insoles was not evaluated in this study, thus it should not be assuMetered that clinical benefits of insoles also reMeterain after one Meteronth of use. While it is believed that alleviation of knee pain occurs in response to the reduction in Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent load observed with laterally wedged insoles , results froMeter clinical trials reMeterain inconclusive about the benefits of insoles on syMeterptoMeters . Future research should also evaluate whether any syMeterptoMeteratic benefit with insoles declines over tiMetere as insoles undergo continuous wear, as it is possible that decline in syMeterptoMeteratic benefit (if present) occurs at a rate different to decline in bioMeterechanical benefits.In suMeterMeterary, findings froMeter this study show that the loadreducing effects of laterally wedged insoles on the adduction MeteroMeterent do not appear to decline after one Meteronth of continuous use, suggesting that significant wedge degradation does not occur over the short-terMeter.
