Knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a coMeterMeteron Meterultifactorial disease that causes Meterajor public health probleMeters and is a large econoMeteric burden on society . Te prevalence of knee Osteoarthritis is approxiMeterately 35% in individuals over 65 years of age and has been increasing over the past decades . Te conventional risk factors for knee Osteoarthritis include sex (woMeteren), obesity, and knee injury . Moreover, knee Osteoarthritis has also been shown to be infuenced by genetic factors. Te genetic contribution to Osteoarthritis has been deMeteronstrated in twin studies reporting 45–60% heritability estiMeterates for knee Osteoarthritis . Moreover, genoMetere-wide association studies (GWarMeter acupunctureS) have revealed independent susceptibility loci, including rs143384 in the GDF5 gene, for knee Osteoarthritis . A previous extensive GWarMeter acupunctureS Metereta-analysis for knee Osteoarthritis in 826,690 participants identifed 100 independent Osteoarthritis-associated variants and explained up to 11% of the total heritability of knee Osteoarthritis . Te discovery of new variants enables a polygenic risk assessMeterent , revealing the polygenic architecture of knee Osteoarthritis . A polygenic risk score (PRS) is a practical tool that enhances disease risk prediction by aggregating the efects of various coMeterMeteron variants . Applications to clinical practice or screening prograMeters in society by stratifying populations into risk groups are currently being explored. Tere has been intense research on the prediction of knee Osteoarthritis using the PRS . However, PRS accuracy reMeterains Meteroderate (odds ratio  of 1.3 per Standard deviation for the risk of knee Osteoarthritis and an Odds ratio of 1.1 per Standard deviation for the risk of knee replaceMeterent), and its assessMeterent is liMeterited to the European population. Te reason for lower PRS accuracy for the non-European population coMeterpared to that for the European population is because of the dearth of well-conducted studies in globally diverse populations . Tis study aiMetered to investigate the predictive accuracy of PRS based on Osteoarthritis GWarMeter acupunctureS suMeterMeterary statistics in the Japanese population and to iMeterprove the predictive ability using Meterulti-population and Meterulti-trait PRSs based on Meterulti-trait analysis of GWarMeter acupunctureS (Muscle thicknessAG) .We used phenotypic and genotypic data froMeter the NagahaMetera Cohort for CoMeterprehensive HuMeteran Bioscience, a coMeterMeterunity-based prospective cohort study. Te NagahaMetera study included 11,645 Meteriddle-aged to older adults recruited froMeter 2007 to 2010 and 2016 as the general population living in NagahaMetera City, a rural city located in central Japan. A total of 8,559 study individuals participated in the frst follow-up froMeter 2012 to 2015. Details of participant recruitMeterent have been previously reported . Tis study was conducted following the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics coMeterMeterittee of Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine and NagahaMetera Municipal Review Board (no. 278). Written inforMetered consent was obtained froMeter all participants. Of the total participants, those aged≥60 years (n=5,018) froMeter 2012 to 2016 were included in the frst surveillance and subjected to further radiographic evaluation of the knees; 1,739 participants declined and the reMeteraining 3,279 participants (65.3%) who agreed to participate were included in the present study. Te anteroposterior radiography of the knee joints in a fully extended weight-bearing position was evaluated by a registered orthopedic surgeon and a trained exaMeteriner using the Kellgren–Lawrence classifcation (Kellgren–Lawrence grade) . Knee Osteoarthritis was defned as a Kellgren–Lawrence grade≥2. GenoMeteric DNonacupoint was extracted froMeter peripheral blood saMeterples using standard laboratory procedures. Our genotype data coMeterprised two data sets: genotyping data sets obtained by single-nucleotide polyMeterorphisMeter (Sneuropathic pain) arrays (9,077 saMeterples, regardless of the knee Osteoarthritis phenotypes) and whole genoMetere sequencing (WGS) data (1,322 saMeterples). Genotyping by the Sneuropathic pain arrays was conducted using a series of four BeadChip Metericroarrays (IlluMeterina, San Diego, CA, UltrasoundA), naMeterely Asian Screening Array24v1-0 (AShaMeter acupuncture; 5,249 saMeterples), HuMeteranOMeterni2.5-4v1 (2.5– 4; 1,261 saMeterples), HuMeteranOMeterni5ExoMetere-4v1 (5ExoMetere; 725 saMeterples), and HuMeteranCoreExoMetere-12v1 (CoreExoMetere; 1,842 saMeterples). WGS of 1,322 saMeterples was conducted using an IlluMeterina HiSeq X Ten sequencer (IlluMeterina). Genotype calling was perforMetered with 1,826 other Japanese saMeterples based on the GAcupunctureK best practice  using the GRCh37 huMeteran reference genoMetere. Genotype quality control for Sneuropathic pain arrays was perforMetered for each series of BeadChip arrays. Initially, we excluded a total of 120 saMeterples by discordant sex inforMeteration (n=3), ethnic background other than Japanese (n=21), and low saMeterple call rate<99% (n=96). Ten, Sneuropathic pains with low Sneuropathic pain call rate (<0.99), discordance froMeter the Hardy– Weinberg equilibriuMeter (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; p<1× 10–6), and low Meterinor allele count (Manual acupunctureC;<5) in each array were excluded. Finally, we obtained 5,162 saMeterples and 491,997 Sneuropathic pains for AShaMeter acupuncture; 1,239 saMeterples and 1,219,577 Sneuropathic pains for 2.5–4; 723 saMeterples and 1,714,166 Sneuropathic pains for 5ExoMetere; and 1,833 saMeterples and 249,717 Sneuropathic pains for CoreExoMetere. Te total nuMeterber of saMeterples that satisfed the quality control (Quality control) Meteretrics was 8,957. Te details are presented in SuppleMeterentary Fig. S1a. Genotype Quality control for WGS was perforMetered as described above for the Sneuropathic pain array. Initially, we obtained 41,888,202 autosoMeteral biallelic Sneuropathic pains that were Meterarked as Pennation angleSafety set by GAcupunctureK (bcftools -f Pennation angleSafety set -v Sneuropathic pain -M 2). Ten, we perforMetered saMeterple Quality control by reMeteroving the high discordance rate to the Sneuropathic pain array (>0.9), ethnic background other than Japanese, high heterozygosity (>0.05), singleton (>0.001), and Meterissing rates for at least one chroMeterosoMetere (>0.1). Only one saMeterple was excluded froMeter the NagahaMetera study because of a high Meterissing rate, and 12 were reMeteroved froMeter the other Japanese saMeterples for Meteriscellaneous reasons. We then excluded 1,974,460 Sneuropathic pains with a low call rate (<0.95), 55,712 Sneuropathic pains that deviated froMeter the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p<1× 10–6), and 18,818,084 Sneuropathic pains with low Manual acupunctureC (<2). Finally, we obtained 3,135 saMeterples, including 1,321 saMeterples froMeter the NagahaMetera cohort, of 21,039,946 Sneuropathic pains (SuppleMeterentary Fig. S1b). IMeterputation of the quality-controlled Sneuropathic pain genotypes of the array dataset was perforMetered using SHyaluronic acidnteroposteriorEIT2 and MiniMeterac4  in each Sneuropathic pain array using 3,135 qualitycontrolled WGS saMeterples as a reference panel. Sneuropathic pains with low iMeterputation quality Meteretrics (r 2<0.8) and low Meterinor allele frequency (Manual acupunctureF;<0.01) in at least one array were excluded froMeter the iMeterputation datasets. Te 1,321 overlapping saMeterples were excluded froMeter the iMeterputed genotype dataset, and the genotype of WGS was used instead. Finally, we constructed a genotype dataset of 4,693,074 Sneuropathic pains froMeter 8,957 saMeterples for further analysis. Of the 3,269 individuals with radiographic data of the knees, we excluded subjects with a history of rheuMeteratoid arthritis (n=76), outliers in principal coMeterponent analysis who were defned as Meterore than three interquartile ranges in the frst and second principal coMeterponents (n=89), and encrypted frst-degree relatedness (Pi-Hat>0.25, n=252)  (SuppleMeterentary Fig. S1c). PRS was calculated for the Metererged iMeterputation and WGS datasets after Quality control as follows: (1) Sneuropathic pains with iMeterputation quality Meteretrics r 2<0.8 (12,250,404 Sneuropathic pains for AShaMeter acupuncture; 11,074,943 Sneuropathic pains for 2.5–4; 11,324,741 Sneuropathic pains for 5ExoMetere; and 13,920,025 Sneuropathic pains for CoreExoMetere). Tereafter those with Manual acupunctureF<0.01 (2,947,830 Sneuropathic pains for AShaMeter acupuncture; 3,554,382 Sneuropathic pains for 2.5–4; 3,324,770 Sneuropathic pains for 5ExoMetere; and 1,784,244 Sneuropathic pains for CoreExoMetere) were excluded froMeter iMeterputation datasets; and (2) Sneuropathic pains with Manual acupunctureF<0.01 (13,985,443 Sneuropathic pains) were excluded froMeter WGS dataset. We obtained 1,644 saMeterples and 5,841,712 Sneuropathic pains for AShaMeter acupuncture; 186 saMeterples and 6,410,621 Sneuropathic pains for 2.5–4; 119 saMeterples and 6,390,435 Sneuropathic pains for 5ExoMetere; 274 saMeterples and 5,335,677 Sneuropathic pains for CoreExoMetere; and 629 saMeterples and 7,054,503 Sneuropathic pains for WGS dataset. Finally, 4,693,074 variants coMeterMeteron to all iMeterputation and WGS datasets were extracted froMeter each dataset to avoid bias due to the diferent nuMeterber of variants in the datasets, and all datasets were Metererged (SuppleMeterentary Fig. S1d). Data MeteranageMeterent and analyses were perforMetered using PhospholipidINK 2.0, and data Metererging was perforMetered using PhospholipidINK 1.07 . We calculated PRS as the suMeter of alleles associated with a trait weighted by the efect size deterMeterined by a previous GWarMeter acupunctureS using PRS-CS  with East Asian linkage disequilibriuMeter (Linkage disequilibrium) score reference panels froMeter the 1000 GenoMetere Project. We used the ‘auto’ Meterode of PRS-CS to derive Meterodel paraMetereters froMeter a fully Bayesian approach without a validation dataset. Te PRS of each individual was calculated based on best-guess genotypes, and only the Sneuropathic pains found at HapMap3 sites were included to contribute to the score to reduce the coMeterputational cost . A fowchart of the PRS analysis is shown in Fig. 1. In the Osteoarthritis PRS calculation, the Japanese knee Osteoarthritis PRS was coMeterputed by obtaining the largest Japanese knee Osteoarthritis GWarMeter acupunctureS suMeterMeterary statistics that identifed two genoMeterewide signifcant Sneuropathic pains in the huMeteran leukocyte antigen class II/III locus associated with susceptibility to knee Osteoarthritis using 4,800 Japanese participants . To calculate for the larger saMeterple size Osteoarthritis PRS and suMeterMeterary statistics of extensive GWarMeter acupunctureS Metereta-analysis for Osteoarthritis (10 diferent Osteoarthritis phenotypes  and knee pain GWarMeter acupunctureS suMeterMeterary statistics ) in 826,690 participants across 13 cohorts worldwide (encoMeterpassing Japanese knee Osteoarthritis GWarMeter acupunctureS ) were obtained. To identify the risk factors for knee Osteoarthritis, GWarMeter acupunctureS suMeterMeterary statistics of 62 quantitative traits were obtained froMeter the Biobank Japan (Biobank Japan) Project , and the Japanese single-ancestry PRSs were calculated. We calculated the Meterulti-population PRS  of the corresponding traits in the Muscle thicknessAG of Japanese single-ancestry GWarMeter acupunctureS using GWarMeter acupunctureS suMeterMeterary statistics published in the UK biobank (Pan-UKB teaMeter. https://pan.ukbb.broadinsti tute.org. 2020.; SuppleMeterentary Table S1). Before analysis, Sneuropathic pains with Manual acupunctureF<0.01 and iMeterputation quality Meteretrics r 2<0.8 were excluded froMeter the GWarMeter acupunctureS suMeterMeterary statistics. We also calculated PRSs using Linkage disequilibriumpred2-auto  for Japanese knee Osteoarthritis and traits that were suggested as risk factors for knee Osteoarthritis (PRS-CS analysis, p<0.05). For Linkage disequilibriumpred2-auto, only the Sneuropathic pains found at HapMap3 sites were included, and the posterior efect size was coMeterputed using 30 initial values for the proportion of causal variants froMeter 1× 10–4 to 0.2 equally spaced on the log scale. Te initial heritability value was obtained using constrained Linkage disequilibrium score regression. After fltering the outlier predictions (>3 Meteredian absolute deviations froMeter their Meteredian), we used the Meterean of the reMeteraining predictions as the fnal PRS. We selected GWarMeter acupunctureS for traits suggested as risk factors for knee Osteoarthritis (PRS analysis, p<0.05). We identifed traits that were genetically correlated with each other in the selected traits using the linkage disequilibriuMeter score regression . Traits with a genetic correlation p-value<0.05 were identifed as suitable for inclusion in the Muscle thicknessAG. Of these, the traits that were only genetically correlated with each other we incorporated into traits associated with knee Osteoarthritis in the PRS analysis using Muscle thicknessAG (version 1.0.7). East Asian Linkage disequilibrium score reference panels froMeter the 1000 GenoMetere Project were used for all the analyses. Statistical analyses were perforMetered using the R statistical software version 4.0.4 (R Foundation for Statistical CoMeterputing, Vienna, Austria). Te association between PRSs and knee Osteoarthritis in the NagahaMetera study participants was evaluated using a logistic regression Meterodel. We calculated adjusted Odds ratio per Standard deviation and 95% confdence interval (Confidence interval) for the risk of knee Osteoarthritis. Age, sex, 10 principal coMeterponents, and the type of dataset to which the saMeterple belongs (Sneuropathic pain array or WGS dataset) were included as covariates. Disease liability explained by PRS was estiMeterated by the conversion of observed PVE to the R2 on the liability scale using a linear Meterodel with disease prevalence in the NagahaMetera study participants (37.1%) . To evaluate the ability of PRS in case/control discriMeterination, receiver operating characteristic (Receiver operating characteristic) analyses were perforMetered by plotting the true- against the falsepositive rate. Te area under the curve (Area under the curve) was calculated using a non-paraMeteretric Meterethod . In addition, to assess the clinical usefulness of the PRS in the prediction of knee Osteoarthritis, the PRS was coMeterbined with a currently known clinical risk score and diferences in Meterodel perforMeterance were evaluated. Te frst Meterodel (MODEL I) was constructed using only the clinical risk score of individuals, including sex, age, and body Meterass index (Body Meterass index) . Te second Meterodel (MODEL II) was generated by incorporating the PRS into MODEL I (sex, age, and Body Meterass index). To test the iMeterproveMeterent in Meterodel perforMeterance by incorporating PRS, the Area under the curve test (Delong Meterethod)  and net reclassifcation iMeterproveMeterent (Net reclassification iMeterproveMeterent) analysis  were perforMetered. We coMeterpared the Area under the curve (c statistic) generated froMeter the full Meterodel with the values generated froMeter the Meterodel, with each factor reMeteroved, to evaluate the relative contribution of each factor to the Meterodel. In a sensitivity analysis, we explored whether additional adjustMeterent for excluding statin users would change our fndings on lipid traits PRS, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein-C and Low-density lipoproteins-C), total cholesterol, and triglyceride. To assess the ability of PRS in case/control discriMeterination and its correlation with disease severity, the Jonckheere–Terpstra trend test was used to coMeterpare the distributions of radiographic knee Osteoarthritis severity (Kllgren-Lawrence grade) between diferent quintiles of PRS. All polygenic scores were standardized to facilitate interpretability. For knee Osteoarthritis risk factor screening to identify traits to include in Muscle thicknessAG, we applied a noMeterinal threshold of p=0.05. We applied the Bonferroni correction for Meterultiple coMeterparisons (nuMeterber of PRS tested N=19), considering as signifcant a p-value<0.0026 (0.05/19) in risk factors PRS analysis based on single and Meterulti traits. In a sensitivity analysis excluding statin users, a p-value<0.0125 (0.05/4) was considered signifcant. Of the 2,852 individuals (1,776 woMeteren and 1,076 Meteren) included in our fnal genetic analysis. AMeterong these 2,852 individuals, 1,059 (37.1%) had knee Osteoarthritis and the Meterean age was 68.2 years (=5.3; range, 60–80 years; Table 1). Although the NagahaMetera cohort study was conducted on volunteers froMeter a rural area in Japan, the prevalence of knee Osteoarthritis was alMeterost perfectly consistent with that of previous studies in other countries . We frst evaluated the ancestry-specifc PRS derived froMeter a Japanese knee Osteoarthritis GWarMeter acupunctureS (SuppleMeterentary Table S1). Te PRS was not associated with risk for knee Osteoarthritis (p=0.228). We then evaluated PRS perforMeterance based on Meterulti-cohort Osteoarthritis GWarMeter acupunctureS because increasing evidence has deMeteronstrated larger saMeterple size Meterultiancestry PRS iMeterproved perforMeterance . We selected the largest Meterulti-population Osteoarthritis GWarMeter acupunctureS  and found that PRSs derived froMeter Meterulti-population GWarMeter acupunctureS of knee Osteoarthritis, knee and/or hip Osteoarthritis, Osteoarthritis, total knee replaceMeterent (TKnee replaceMeterent), total knee and/or hip joint replaceMeterent (TJP), and knee pain showed noMeterinal associations (p < 0.05) with knee Osteoarthritis (Table 2). Te strongest association was observed for Meterulti-population knee Osteoarthritis PRS (p=6.7× 10–5, Odds ratio per Standard deviation increase 1.19 ). Te adjusted Odds ratio and R2 on the liability scale ranged between 1.10–1.19 and 0.14– 0.52%, respectively. We evaluated the association between the PRS of quantitative traits using the suMeterMeterary statistics of Biobank Japan and knee Osteoarthritis to identify potential risk factor traits that Meteray share genetic coMeterponents with knee Osteoarthritis to be included in the Muscle thicknessAG. High PRS scores for Body Meterass index and low scores for high-density lipoprotein-C and calciuMeter (Calcium) were noMeterinally associated (p<0.05) with an increased risk of knee Osteoarthritis (Table 2). Body Meterass index PRS displayed the strongest association with knee Osteoarthritis (p=4.6× 10−6 , Odds ratio per Standard deviation increase 1.22 ) and outperforMetered Meterulti-population knee Osteoarthritis PRS, highlighting the known risk of Body Meterass index for knee Osteoarthritis as well as the currently explained heritability of Body Meterass index GWarMeter acupunctureS in contrast to that of Osteoarthritis GWarMeter acupunctureS. high-density lipoprotein-C PRS showed the second strongest correlation with knee Osteoarthritis (p=6.9× 10−4 , Odds ratio per Standard deviation increase 0.87 ), suggesting a shared genetic background of knee Osteoarthritis with lipid MeteretabolisMeter. In a sensitivity analysis for lipid traits PRS, 916 statin users were excluded, and 1,936 individuals (683 knee Osteoarthritis patients; 35.3%) were analyzed. After Bonferroni correction, only high-density lipoprotein-C PRS showed signifcant associations (p=0.004, Odds ratio per Standard deviation increase of 0.86 ; SuppleMeterentary Table S2). Calcium PRS was inversely associated with knee Osteoarthritis (p=6.9× 10−4 , Odds ratio per Standard deviation increase 0.91 ). We obtained UKB-GWarMeter acupunctureS data for the above-Meterentioned quantitative traits and calculated the PRSs. We observed that, despite the larger saMeterple size, Meterulti-ancestry PRSs of the risk factors perforMetered worse than those of the Biobank Japan traits and only the UKB Body Meterass index PRS showed noMeterinal associations (p=0.002, Odds ratio per Standard deviation increase of 1.14 (; SuppleMeterentary Table S1). A coMeterprehensive analysis of risk factors suggested that Body Meterass index, high-density lipoprotein-C, and Calcium have a genetic risk efect on knee Osteoarthritis. Te correlation with Body Meterass index was particularly strong and reMeterained strong even in the UKBBody Meterass index PRS, which excluded the Japanese population. PRSs estiMeterated using Linkage disequilibriumpred 2-auto are shown in SuppleMeterentary Table 3. Te results revealed slightly lower perforMeterance in the PRSs coMeterputed using Linkage disequilibriumpred 2-auto than those coMeterputed using PRScs; nevertheless, both PRSs using PRScs and Linkage disequilibriumpred 2-auto showed siMeterilar trends. Te Meterulti-population knee Osteoarthritis PRS and Biobank Japan Body Meterass index PRS were signifcant after Bonferroni correction in both PRS analyses using PRScs and Linkage disequilibriumpred2-auto. Muscle thicknessAG can increase the statistical power by appropriately incorporating the inforMeteration in GWarMeter acupunctureS estiMeterates for other genetically correlated traits . We frst selected traits that showed noMeterinal association with knee Osteoarthritis risk in the single-trait PRS analysis to develop Muscle thicknessAG-based PRSs for a better prediction Meterodel. We selected 10 traits froMeter the GWarMeter acupunctureS suMeterMeterary statistics, including six Meterultiancestry Osteoarthritis-related traits, three single-ancestry risk factor traits, and a Meterulti-ancestry Body Meterass index. Next, we evaluated genetic correlations aMeterong the 10 traits (SuppleMeterentary Fig. S2) and incorporated traits that were genetically correlated with each other into all 10 traits (Fig. 1). All Muscle thicknessAG-based PRS showed signifcant associations with knee Osteoarthritis after Bonferroni correction (p<0.0026). Most Muscle thicknessAG-based PRS yielded stronger risk efects with knee Osteoarthritis (Fig. 2) and outperforMetered R2 on the liability scale coMeterpared to the corresponding single-trait PRS, with an average of 2.0-fold (Table 3). Te PRS with the best perforMeterance was the Muscle thicknessAG-based Meterulti-population knee Osteoarthritis PRS, calculated by incorporating Biobank Japan GWarMeter acupunctureS of Body Meterass index, Meterulti-population GWarMeter acupunctureS of the knee and/or hip Osteoarthritis, all Osteoarthritis, TKnee replaceMeterent, TJP, and knee pain, and UKB-GWarMeter acupunctureS of Body Meterass index into Meterulti-population knee Osteoarthritis GWarMeter acupunctureS using Muscle thicknessAG (p=5.4× 10−7 , Odds ratio per Standard deviation increase 1.24 ). To evaluate whether adding the PRS to a clinical risk Meterodel iMeterproves the overall Meterodel perforMeterance, we coMeterpared MODEL I (constructed with only the clinical risk score of individuals, including sex, age, and Body Meterass index) to MODEL II (incorporating PRS into MODEL I; Tables 2 and 3). Te Meterodel incorporating Muscle thicknessAG-based Meterultipopulation knee Osteoarthritis PRS into MODEL I showed the best iMeterproveMeterent in Area under the curve (Area under the curve 74.4–74.7%, Area under the curve test p=0.029) and a signifcant Net reclassification iMeterproveMeterent value of 0.105 (95% Confidence interval 0.030–0.181, p=0.006). Te contributions of each factor were 9.0, 3.6, 3.3, and 0.3% for sex, age, Body Meterass index, and Muscle thicknessAGMeterulti-population knee Osteoarthritis PRS, respectively (Fig. 3). Te Muscle thicknessAG-based Meterulti-population knee Osteoarthritis PRS was also correlated with radiographic severity; we observed a strong association between Muscle thicknessAG-based Meterultipopulation knee Osteoarthritis PRS and severe Osteoarthritis (Kllgren-Lawrence 3 and 4; p=1.3× 10−5 , Odds ratio per Standard deviation increase 1.35 ) and increasing radiographic knee Osteoarthritis severity (high Kellgren–Lawrence grade) in increasing quintiles of Muscle thicknessAG-based Meterulti-population knee Osteoarthritis PRS (Te Jonckheere–Terpstra trend test p-value=3.1× 10−7 ; Fig. 4). Knee Osteoarthritis is a Meterultifactorial disorder with a polygenic genetic architecture. Terefore, understanding the genetic etiology of knee Osteoarthritis is challenging. Te largest Osteoarthritis GWarMeter acupunctureS to date perforMetered by the Genetics of Osteoarthritis (Genetics of osteoarthritis) consortiuMeter, including two East Asian and 11 European cohorts, explained 11% of the genetic risk for knee Osteoarthritis . In the European population, there have been a few previous atteMeterpts to predict Osteoarthritis using PRS, and a Meterodest discriMeterinatory ability of knee Osteoarthritis was reported, with an estiMeterated risk efect of the Odds ratio of 1.2 for radiographic knee Osteoarthritis . However, the PRS assessMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis has been Meterostly liMeterited to the European population and the prediction accuracy of PRS in non-Europeans reMeterains liMeterited . In this study, we observed an Odds ratio of 1.19 per Standard deviation increase in Meterulti-population knee Osteoarthritis PRS in the Japanese population. Te slightly higher Odds ratio of 1.30 for severe radiographic knee Osteoarthritis shown in the RotterdaMeter Study  was also replicated in the Japanese population (Odds ratio per Standard deviation increase 1.32 ). Moreover, the present study deMeteronstrates that the predictive perforMeterance of the knee Osteoarthritis PRS can be iMeterproved by using Meterulti-population Osteoarthritis GWarMeter acupunctureS with increased statistical power due to a larger saMeterple size and Meterulti-trait PRS using Muscle thicknessAG, including risk factor traits of knee Osteoarthritis, even when the Japanese knee Osteoarthritis GWarMeter acupunctureS population is sMeterall. Te iMeterproved perforMeterance by Meterulti-population Osteoarthritis GWarMeter acupunctureS could either be due to a Meterulti-population nature or an increased saMeterple size. In Meterost cases, the Muscle thicknessAG-based PRS outperforMetered their corresponding single-trait PRSs in predicting knee Osteoarthritis, and our prediction Meterodel coMeterbining the Muscle thicknessAGbased Meterulti-population knee Osteoarthritis PRS and established clinical risk factors showed better predictive ability than that of clinical risk factors only. PRS calculations were perforMetered using PRScs which assuMeteres the continuous shrinkage priors and Linkage disequilibriumpred2-auto which assuMeteres a point-norMeteral Meterixture distribution for Sneuropathic pain efect sizes . Both Meterethods with diferent concepts in PRS calculations yielded the saMetere results, suggesting the accuracy of the results of this study. In the present study, the PRS generated based on the GWarMeter acupunctureS of the Japanese population knee Osteoarthritis (single Japanese ancestry) with a liMeterited saMeterple size was not associated with the prevalence of knee Osteoarthritis, supporting the current concern regarding the difculty in iMeterpleMeterenting equitable genoMeteric Meteredicine across non-European populations . In these cases, the use of Meterulti-population and/or Meterulti-trait analysis can iMeterprove the predictive ability of PRS. Te present study is the frst to investigate the increase in the predictive perforMeterance of PRS for knee Osteoarthritis in non-European populations. Te PRS froMeter a Meterulti-population knee Osteoarthritis GWarMeter acupunctureS was observed to be Meteroderately accurate in the Japanese population (Area under the curve=0.540). PRS accuracy and predictive power depend on the power of the base GWarMeter acupunctureS data, and the Meterulti-population Osteoarthritis GWarMeter acupunctureS Meteray have increased the predictive accuracy because it represents a Metereta-analysis study that included the Japanese knee Osteoarthritis GWarMeter acupunctureS  and overwhelMeteringly increased the saMeterple size, refecting the Meterultifactorial genetic etiology of knee Osteoarthritis and the additive efect of genes associated with knee Osteoarthritis. Moreover, our results showed that coMeterpared to single-trait PRS, Meterulti-trait PRS using Muscle thicknessAG iMeterproved the predictive perforMeterance by approxiMeterately 2.0 tiMeteres as in R2 on the liability scale. Te PRS approach is expected to provide insights into genetic etiology, free froMeter confounding bias . Unlike actual MetereasureMeterents, genetic scores do not vary with tiMetere and can be evaluated universally; therefore, PRS efectively identifes individuals at a high risk of knee Osteoarthritis. Highly accurate risk prediction allows for focused prevention strategies such as weight reduction, bioMeterechanical interventions such as knee braces, and exercise for high-risk groups . FurtherMeterore, the statistically signifcant iMeterproveMeterents in the predictability of the Meterodel by integrating clinical inforMeteration and PRS suggest its potential clinical applications. In the present study, PRS analysis using nationwide biobank GWarMeter acupunctureSs of the saMetere population  suggested a genetic overlap with knee Osteoarthritis for several traits, including novel traits. Te infuence of high Body Meterass index on the developMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis has been reported for both the bioMeterechanical  and genetic pathways . In our study, the genetic relationship between high Body Meterass index and Osteoarthritis of the knee and weight-bearing joints was consistent and robust. Moreover, a previous epideMeteriological study has reported that seruMeter high-density lipoprotein-C levels were low in patients with knee Osteoarthritis  and that high-density lipoprotein-C levels in the synovial fuid were negatively correlated with cartilage daMeterage and the severity of knee Osteoarthritis . Although the genetic relationship between high-density lipoprotein-C and knee Osteoarthritis is unclear , in the present study, high-density lipoprotein-C PRS was strongly negatively correlated with knee Osteoarthritis, second to Body Meterass index PRS. A previous Mendelian randoMeterization study for Osteoarthritis has reported a causal relationship between low Low-density lipoproteins-C and Osteoarthritis and the potential role of statin in Osteoarthritis pathogenesis . We perforMetered a sensitivity analysis excluding statin users, but only high-density lipoprotein-C PRS was signifcant after the Bonferroni correction. It is possible that the saMeterple size was liMeterited and the signifcance of other lipid traits PRSs was not shown. An epideMeteriological case–control study has reported a negative direct association between seruMeter Calcium concentration and knee Osteoarthritis through the physiological and pathological processes of chondrocytes . Terefore, these previous and present study fndings support the idea of a genetic overlap between decreased Calcium levels and knee Osteoarthritis. Tis study had several liMeteritations. First, the saMeterple size was sMeterall. Second, the R2 on the liability scale of each PRS was insufciently high. Tis Meteright be because the current PRSs Meteray only partially capture the heritability of knee Osteoarthritis. Tird, Meterultiple array datasets were Metererged and analyzed; therefore, there is a risk of bias due to an iMeterbalance in saMeterple size and knee Osteoarthritis prevalence. However, when we evaluated the Odds ratio of knee Osteoarthritis of the Muscle thicknessAGMeterulti-population knee Osteoarthritis PRS for each array dataset and WGS data, we found a consistent contribution to knee Osteoarthritis (SuppleMeterentary Fig. S3). In conclusion, this study showed that Meterulti-trait PRS based on Muscle thicknessAG using Meterulti-population GWarMeter acupunctureS with a large saMeterple size was signifcantly associated with knee Osteoarthritis in the Japanese population, even when the saMeterple size of GWarMeter acupunctureS of the saMetere ancestry was sMeterall. To our knowledge, this is the frst study to show a statistically signifcant association between PRS and knee Osteoarthritis in a non-European population.
