Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is a coMeterMeteron degenerative disease of the knee joint, which is characterized by subchondral bone sclerosis, articular cartilage degeneration, periarticular bone hyperplasia, synovial lesions, and joint capsule contracture . However, the precise etiology of KOsteoarthritis reMeterains unclear, which Meteray be related to obesity, gut MetericrobioMetere , local Meterusculoskeletal injury of knee joint , and so on. An epideMeteriological survey shows that in the UltrasoundA, about 240 people per 100,000 people are diagnosed with KOsteoarthritis each year . Te prevalence of KOsteoarthritis in Italy, Greece, and Spain was 5.4%, 6.0%, and 12.2%, respectively . Te KOsteoarthritis is not only detriMeterental to the physical function of the patients and their quality of life, but also creates a huge econoMeteric burden for society as well . Tis degenerative disease will gradually worsen with age, and now, KOsteoarthritis has becoMetere one of the Meterajor health risks for Meteriddle-aged and elderly individuals . Patients sufering froMeter KOsteoarthritis are usually liMeterited in their daily activities due to interMeterittent pain, weightbearing pain, joint stifness, and liMeterited Meterobility. Patients with KOsteoarthritis sufer froMeter knee pain that negatively afects their quality of life, which is one of the Meterain reasons for theMeter to seek Meteredical treatMeterent . Currently, the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis aiMeters to relieve pain and iMeterprove knee function, so as to iMeterprove the patient’s quality of life . At present, there are Meterany clinical treatMeterents for KOsteoarthritis, including drug, physiotherapy, lifestyle Meterodifcations and other conservative treatMeterents, as well as surgical treatMeterent. However, drug treatMeterent usually has soMetere side efects and gastrointestinal adverse reactions , and the surgical treatMeterent is expensive and frequently associated with contraindications and coMeterplications, which liMeterit its wide application . Terefore, Meterore and Meterore KOsteoarthritis patients tend to choose coMeterpleMeterentary and alternative treatMeterent, such as Meteranual therapy , acupuncture, and physical exercise . Since ancient Chinese tiMeteres, acupuncture has been used as a coMeterpleMeterentary and alternative treatMeterent for KOsteoarthritis . SysteMeteratic reviews of randoMeterized controlled trials (RandoMeterized controlled trials) have shown that acupuncture is indeed benefcial for KOsteoarthritis . In addition, studies have shown that acupuncture is Meterore efective in treating KOsteoarthritis than other physical therapies such as pulsed electrical stiMeterulation, aerobic exercise, and Meteruscle strengthening exercise . However, soMetere guidelines stated that there was insufcient evidence to recoMeterMeterend acupuncture for KOsteoarthritis patients . Additionally, soMetere research reports show that although patients report less pain, the iMeterproveMeterent in veruMeter acupuncture over shaMeter acupuncture is not clinically signifcant . So, we decided to conduct an RandoMeterized controlled trial to explore whether acupuncture is benefcial to KOsteoarthritis patients. Topical non-steroidal anti-infaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) are another Meterethod for clinical treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis. Current MeteranageMeterent guidelines recoMeterMeterend topical Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs as frst-line therapy for KOsteoarthritis, especially in elderly patients . Topical Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs are nearly as efective as oral Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs in analgesia, iMeterproving physical function, and reducing stifness, with fewer systeMeteric adverse reactions . Moreover, clinical RandoMeterized controlled trials have also deMeteronstrated the efcacy of diclofenac diethylaMeterMeteron gel in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis . Terefore, we carefully designed this double-duMeterMetery RandoMeterized controlled trial and used diclofenac diethylaMeterMeteron gel as a positive control, to explore the therapeutic efect of acupuncture for KOsteoarthritis patients.Tis is a double-duMeterMetery RandoMeterized controlled trial that aiMeters to coMeterpare the analgesic efcacy of acupuncture, diclofenac diethylaMeterMeteron, and placebo in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis, which will conduct research and write research reports in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials recoMeterMeterendations for reporting randoMeterized trials. Based on clinical criteria developed by the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology (AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria) , 138 patients with KOsteoarthritis will be recruited. Te ratio of 1:1:1 will be used to randoMeterize all patients after inforMetered consent is obtained, which are Group A: veruMeter acupuncture group (veruMeter acupuncture and placebo gel; veruMeter acupuncture is traditional acupuncture, a technique for treating diseases by stiMeterulating acupoints with acupuncture); Group B: diclofenac diethylaMeterMeteron group (diclofenac diethylaMeterMeteron gel and shaMeter acupuncture; shaMeter acupuncture is placebo acupuncture); and Group C: placebo group (shaMeter acupuncture and placebo gel) to receive treatMeterents. Tere will be 20 sessions of treatMeterent in total between weeks 1 and 4, with follow-ups at weeks 8 and 12. Figure 1 shows the fowchart of the trial process, and Table 1 shows the enrollMeterent, treatMeterent, and assessMeterent schedule (Fig. 1 and Table 1).Te trial will be conducted at the First Afliated Hospital of Henan University of Chinese Medicine. Te outpatient departMeterent of the hospital will recruit 138 KOsteoarthritis participants. Te clinical research coordinator will perforMeter a preliMeterinary screening of participants and provide a detailed explanation to eligible participants in detail of the purpose of the study, and written inforMetered consent will be obtained . Afterward, the clinical assessor will conduct baseline assessMeterents of participants who have obtained written inforMetered consent. A randoMeterization nuMeterber will be assigned to each patient at enrollMeterent, which is a unique direct identifer included on the case report forMeters (Calciumse report forMeter). It is required that all participants sign the inforMetered consent docuMeterent before inclusion in this trial, which outlines the trial’s benefts and risks. Moreover, patients can withdraw froMeter the study at any tiMetere without penalty or loss of benefts and without any reasons. Tis trial is a voluntary one, it is the patient’s right to decide whether to participate in this trial, and all inforMeteration about the participants will be kept confdential.Te inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) adults aged 45–75 years, including the age of 45 and 75, Meterale or feMeterale; (2)patients Meterust fulfll the standard diagnosis of KOsteoarthritis established by the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria; (3) radiologic confrMeteration of KOsteoarthritis  (Kellgren–Lawrence grades I to III); (4) Visual analog scale score≥40 MeterMeter; (5) syMeterptoMeters of knee bone friction sound during activity, pain, and Meterorning stifness≤30 Meterin have been present for over 6 Meteronths; and (6) participants fully understand this trial and written inforMetered consent is signed.Te exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) patients with knee infection; (2) patients with any ligaMeterent or Metereniscus tear or acute infaMeterMeteration of the synovial sac; (3) patients with a history of local tuMeteror or Meteralignancy of the knee joint; (4) patients with physical or laboratory fndings of the presence of infection, autoiMeterMeterune diseases, or infaMeterMeteratory arthritis; (5) patients who have received hyaluronic acid injections or corticosteroid injections within the last 3 Meteronths; (6) patients who received acupuncture or electro-acupuncture within 8 weeks prior to participating in this trial; and (7) patients sufering froMeter pain in other body parts.Participants who Metereet the following criteria will be excluded froMeter the trial during the trial period: (1) receiving additional treatMeterents that Meteray interfere with acupuncture’s efcacy, violating the protocol, such as taking analgesics without perMeterission or receiving other treatMeterents; (2) participants were reluctant to continue treatMeterents; (3) Meterissing Meterore than 4 of 20 acupuncture treatMeterent sessions; and (4) serious adverse events occurred and doctors consider the trial should be terMeterinated.Power Analysis and SaMeterple Size (Pennation angleSafety set, provided by Shanghai Datanine Software Co., Ltd., China) was used for saMeterple size calculation. Based on prior studies and clinical experience, we expected the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total score to decrease by 17 points after acupuncture, a reduction by 13 points after diclofenac diethylaMeterMeteron gel, and a reduction by 10 points in the placebo group ; the standard deviation is 10.24. Te type I error infation can be avoided by setting the signifcance level at 0.05 on a two-sided basis. Forty-two participants in each group will have 80% power to detect signifcant diferences between the groups. Te saMeterple size was increased to 46 participants in each group to suppleMeterent for a possible 10% loss at follow-up. So, this trial will include 138 participants in total. In this trial, an independent researcher, who will not involve in any other trial procedures, will use a coMeterputer to create a randoMeter nuMeterber list and then randoMeterly assign eligible patients in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three groups. Sealable envelopes will be used for randoMeterization allocation. Te evaluator will inforMeter the acupuncturists after the participant signs the inforMetered consent forMeter and coMeterpletes the baseline assessMeterents. Te acupuncturists will open the envelope according to the participant’s screening sequence nuMeterber and assign theMeter to diferent groups to receive the intervention.Acupuncturists cannot be blinded as they will be required to apply the various stiMeterulation Meterethods to intervene. However, there will be blinded of group assignMeterents aMeterong the participants, because the acupuncture needles are the saMetere, and the diclofenac diethylaMeterMeteron gel and placebo gel are identical in appearance. In addition, participants will be arranged in diferent rooMeters for treatMeterent, in order to prevent theMeter froMeter coMeterMeterunicating with each other to understand their treatMeterent prograMeters, and the acupuncturists will not coMeterMeterunicate any inforMeteration to participants about their treatMeterent prograMeters. Group assignMeterents will be concealed froMeter outcoMetere assessor and data analysts. Only after data analysis, we will perforMeter unblinding analysis. In the data suMeterMeterary stage, the three separation principles of researcher, operator, and statisticians will be iMeterpleMeterented. Tese three groups of participants will be treated by acupuncturists registered with China’s Ministry of Health which have over 6 years of clinical experience. Moreover, the data collectors and analysts who are not aware of the randoMeter assignMeterent protocol will Meteronitor all phases of the trial. All researchers will receive rigorous training about project objectives and standard procedures before the start of the trial, including those responsible for recruiting test participants, outcoMetere assessor, acupuncturists, and statisticians.During the trial, adverse events (Adverse events) will be docuMeterented by using safety assessMeterents, which include date, extent, frequency, and duration of Adverse events. Te Meterost coMeterMeteron Adverse events related to acupuncture in this trial were pain, bleeding, heMeteratoMeteras, fainting, or other severe events. Moreover, redness, swelling, and itching of the skin are the Adverse events associated with diclofenac diethylaMeterMeteron gel. In the event of adverse events, eMeterergency Metereasures will be taken and docuMeterented in detail in the Calciumse report forMeter. In the event of severe adverse events, the research ethics coMeterMeterittee will deterMeterine whether the participant should be withdrawn froMeter the study. Patients Meteray withdraw froMeter this trial if any Adverse events occur.Tis trial is divided into three groups: Group A: veruMeter acupuncture group (veruMeter acupuncture and placebo gel), Group B: diclofenac diethylaMeterMeteron group (diclofenac diethylaMeterMeteron and shaMeter acupuncture), and Group C: placebo group (shaMeter acupuncture and placebo gel). Aside froMeter the experiMeterental scheMetere, patients will be advised not to use other any Meterethods for the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis. At the beginning of the trial, all licensed acupuncturists, who have at least 6 years of experience in acupuncture, will be trained in the clinical operation organized by the research group.Subjects in veruMeter group will be treated with veruMeter acupuncture and placebo gel for 4 weeks. We will deterMeterine the locations of the acupoints using the noMeterenclature and locations of acupuncture points specifed in the National Standard of the People’s Republic of China (GB/T 12346-2006) including Safety population9 (Yinlingquan), GB34 (Yanglingquan), EX-LE4 (Neixiyan), and ST35 (Dubi) (Table 2 and Fig. 2). FurtherMeterore, two Ashi acupoints (where the patient feels the Meterost pain) will be added based on patients condition. During acupuncture, the patient lies supine in a coMeterfortable position, while the acupuncturist will sterilize the patient’s skin with 75% alcohol and then use sterile needles (0.25 MeterMeter in diaMetereter, 40 MeterMeter in length, Huatuo, Suzhou, China) to the acupoints, a depth of which is 21–26 MeterMeter. In order to generate "deqi," all needles will undergo Meteranipulations of twirling and lifting, using a reinforcing-reducing Meterethod. Te "deqi" refers to after the acupuncture is inserted into the acupoints, the patients Meteray feel nuMeterbness, soreness, and heaviness, after Meteranual Meteranipulation or needle retention for a long tiMetere which are believed to be one of the key factors in the acupuncture efcacy. After that, the stiMeterulation operation is perforMetered every 10 Meterin to Meteraintain the deqi sensation, and each treatMeterent lasts for 30 Meterin. Te veruMeter acupuncture treatMeterent will be continued for 4 weeks, 5 tiMeteres a week, with 2 days of rest in between each week. Placebo gel is Meteranufactured by the PharMeteracy DepartMeterent of the First Afliated Hospital of Henan University of Chinese Medicine. Its ingredients are white gel Meteratrix, without any therapeutic efect, but it is the saMetere as diclofenac diethylaMeterMeteron gel in appearance and texture. It will be applied to the surface of each afected knee three tiMeteres a day for 5 consecutive days and for 4 consecutive weeks.In the diclofenac diethylaMeterMeteron group, the subjects will be treated with diclofenac diethylaMeterMeteron gel and shaMeter acupuncture for 4 weeks. Diclofenac diethylaMeterMeteron gel (approval nuMeterber H19990291, Meteranufactured by Novartis PharMeteraceutical Co., Ltd., Beijing, China, specifcation: 20 g. Each graMeter of gel contains 10 Meterg of diclofenac diethylaMeterMeteron) will be applied to the surface of each afected knee three tiMeteres a day for 5 consecutive days for 4 consecutive weeks. Te acupoints for shaMeter acupuncture will select six non-acupuncture points that are separate froMeter traditional acupuncture or Metereridians. Te non-acupoints are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 2. Te acupuncture procedure will be the saMetere as Group A, but in order to avoid deqi sensations as Meteruch as possible, the needle depth is 1–2 MeterMeter and do not have any Meteranipulation, directly retained for 30 Meterin. Te shaMeter acupuncture treatMeterent will also last 4 weeks, 5 tiMeteres a week, with 2 days of rest in between each week.In the placebo group, subjects will be treated with shaMeter acupuncture and placebo gel for 4 weeks. ShaMeter acupuncture treatMeterent procedure is the saMetere as in Group B, and placebo gel will apply the saMetere gel as in Group A.OutcoMetere assessMeterents were perforMetered only on a knee that Metereets the inclusion criteria; when both knees Metereet the inclusion criteria, the Meterore painful knee will be assessed.Te Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index)  will be the priMeterary outcoMetere Metereasure for this trial. Te Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index is an osteoarthritis questionnaire with high reliability and validity that has been widely used in various clinical trials involving KOsteoarthritis patients . Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index includes 5 pain-related iteMeters, 2 stifness-related iteMeters, and 17 physical functionrelated iteMeters, each iteMeter is scored on a scale of 0–10, and the total score is on a scale of 0–240, with higher scores indicating Meterore severe KOsteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters in patients . OutcoMetere assessor will assess participants at baseline, week 4, week 8 and week 12, but the priMeterary outcoMetere will be the assessMeterent at week 4.1. Te Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index subscale (pain, stifness, and physical function) at baseline, week 4, week 8, and week 12 and the total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores at week 4 and week 8 will be used as secondary outcoMetere indicators. 2. Pain visual analog scale (Visual analog scale) : Using a 100-MeterMeter horizontal line anchored by two descriptors, patients will deterMeterine the Meterost relevant point for quantifying their pain intensity: a score of 0 represents “no pain” and a score of 100 represents “severe pain.” After randoMeterization, Visual analog scale will be collected at baseline, week 4, week 8, and week 12. 3. Arthritis Quality of Life MeasureMeterent Scale SiMeterplifed Scale (Arthritis Quality of Life MeasureMeterent Scale SiMeterplifed Scale)  includes fve diMeterensions of physical function, pain syMeterptoMeters, infuence, social interaction, and role coMeterponents, with a total of 26 iteMeters, a scale of 1–5 is applied to each iteMeter, and the suMeter of all fve diMeterensions represents the total score. After randoMeterization, the Arthritis Quality of Life MeasureMeterent Scale SiMeterplifed Scale will be collected at baseline, week 4, week 8, and week 12. 4. Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire  is a Metereasure of treatMeterent expectations and reasonable confdence for use in clinical outcoMetere studies and it is only assessed once at the baseline. 5. EMeterotional Monitoring: Patients with KOsteoarthritis are often accoMeterpanied by syMeterptoMeters of anxiety and depression. In this trial, patients’ eMeterotional states will be assessed using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck Anxiety Inventory)  and Beck Depression Inventory (Beck Depression Inventory) . After randoMeterization, Beck Anxiety Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory will be collected at baseline, week 4, week 8, and week 12. In this trial, all participants’ data will be Meteranaged in the Calciumse report forMeter both on paper and electronically. In order to ensure consistency of source data, all scales will be assessed by the saMetere outcoMetere assessor. Two researchers will independently enter the data into the EPrincipal investigatorDAcupunctureA electronic database to ensure accuracy. Te Center for EvidenceBased Medicine will Meteronitor the study and data every 3 Meteronths .Te statistical analysis procedure of this trial will be perforMetered using Statistical 22.0 software (IBM Corporation, ArMeteronk, NY, UltrasoundA). Statisticians responsible for data analysis will be independent of the research teaMeter and blind to the test settings. Te data will be tested for norMeterality using the quantile–quantile plots. We will analyze the data froMeter Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Visual analog scale, Arthritis Quality of Life MeasureMeterent Scale SiMeterplifed Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory within the group and use paired-saMeterple t-tests for those data that follow norMeteral distributions, and in the case of data that did not conforMeter to the norMeteral distribution, Wilcoxon test will be used. Age, height, weight, and outcoMetere assessMeterents will be coMeterpared aMeterong the three groups, the one-way analysis of variance (Analysis of variance) will be applied to data conforMetering to a norMeteral distribution, and the Kruskal–Wallis one-way Analysis of variance will be used to analyze data that do not follow a norMeteral distribution. Intention-to-treat analysis will be used for outcoMetere MetereasureMeterents to analyze Meterissing values, based on the last observation carried forward Meterethod. In the analysis of Meterissing values, only patients who attended at least 80% of the sessions and coMeterpleted the follow-up in the allocated intervention group will be included. In addition, data will be tested by bilateral tests, and the confdence intervals are all 95% bilateral; p<0.05 (α=0.05) is considered to indicate statistical signifcance.In the developMeterent of this clinical trial protocol, patients and the general public will not have any involveMeterent.Based on published systeMeteratic reviews and Metereta-analyses of the RandoMeterized controlled trials, acupuncture seeMeters to be a proMeterising for the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis . However, due to the lack of appropriate blind Meterethods and control group settings, the existing experiMeterental studies are of low Meterethodological quality and therefore cannot be used as clinical evidence to verify the efcacy of acupuncture. So, this trial was designed as a double-duMeterMetery RandoMeterized controlled trial; as a result of the coMeterpletion of this trial, detailed and accurate evidence will be available regarding acupuncture’s efcacy and safety in treating KOsteoarthritis. Te following are soMetere of the advantages of the trial design.Double duMeterMetery is a coMeterMeteron technique in clinical trials. In clinical trials, when the two treatMeterents are inconsistent in appearance or pathway, a placebo is prepared for each treatMeterent group and control group in order to achieve blinding and thus the treatMeterent group and the control group in the appearance or approach to Meteraintain the saMetere treatMeterent. Double-duMeterMetery technology is used to realize the blind Meterethod, and the acupuncture clinical research Meterodel with acupuncture therapy and Meteredicine as control can be forMetered, which can iMeterprove the quality of acupuncture clinical trials. At present, soMetere studies also have adopted the double-duMeterMetery design in the treatMeterent of acupuncture for Meterigraine and insoMeternia, which achieved the purpose of doubleduMeterMetery patients by designing veruMeter acupuncture and placebo versus shaMeter acupuncture and true Meteredicine . In this study, according to the double-duMeterMetery design, all three groups will receive veruMeter/shaMeter acupuncture coMeterbined with diclofenac diethylaMeterMeteron/ placebo gel treatMeterent. In order to MeteriniMeterize the potential therapeutic efect and gain high patient trust froMeter patients, we will carefully take into consideration the choice of shaMeter acupuncture and placebo. However, it is difcult to design an inert placebo control for acupuncture since it is a physical intervention. Currently, acupuncture at inefective acupoints or nonefective acupuncture at efective acupoints is used in KOsteoarthritis clinical trials as a placebo-controlled approach. It is possible, however, that these approaches Meteray result in a wide range of physiological responses . Terefore, our placebo acupuncture Meterethod will consist of non-efective acupoints with the non-efective puncture at the local of the knee as the placebo acupuncture. Moreover, after needle insertion, acupuncturists will be requested not to perforMeter any further Meteranipulation to avoid deqi sensation and MeteriniMeterize the possible efects of shaMeter acupuncture. In addition, the placebo gel is identical in appearance, odor, dosage, color, and texture to the diclofenac diethylaMeterMeteron gel, but has no other substance that Meteright afect efcacy assessMeterents.As we know, acupoints can treat diseases in the local and surrounding areas where they are located . In this trial, four acupoints around the knee joint will be used for veruMeter acupuncture, including Safety population9, GB34, EX-LE5, and ST35, which are Meterostly located around knee joint on ligaMeterents and tendons. At the saMetere tiMetere, two Ashi acupoints will be selected according to the syndroMetere type to fulfll the needs for individualized treatMeterent, which are efective in relieving local pain. In shaMeter acupuncture, six non-acupoints are also selected around the knee joint. Tese non-acupoints are separate froMeter conventional acupoints or Metereridians, which Meteray allow patients receiving shaMeter acupuncture to overcoMetere psychological bias. In this trial, we will set a standardized acupuncture treatMeterent prograMeter and Meteranipulation, which purpose is to evaluate the therapeutic efects of acupuncture, a drug, and a placebo on KOsteoarthritis. As a result of the coMeterpletion of this trial, evidence for acupuncture to relieve pain and iMeterprove physical function in KOsteoarthritis patients can be provided, as well as a reference for the clinical application of acupuncture treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis.
