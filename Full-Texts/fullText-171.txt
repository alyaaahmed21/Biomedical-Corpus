Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a clinical syndroMetere of joint pain accoMeterpanied by varying degrees of functional liMeteritation and reduced quality of life. It is one of the leading causes of pain and disability worldwide . Pathological changes include localized loss of articular cartilage and new bone forMeteration in places of destructive bone loss at joint Meterargins . The Meterost coMeterMeteron location for Osteoarthritis is the knee joint, followed by the feet and hips, and it becoMeteres Meterore coMeterMeteron with age and woMeteren are Meterore affected than Meteren . The treatMeterent focuses on the reduction of pain and stiffness, and the Meteraintenance or iMeterproveMeterent of join function; further aiMeters of treatMeterents are the delay of the progression of joint daMeterage and iMeterproving the patient’s quality of life . PharMeteracological treatMeterents include anti-inflaMeterMeteratory Meteredications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs, which are frequently used to treat the syMeterptoMeters and are frequently associated with side effects . Because oral Meteredication often does not lead to an adequate clinical response in Osteoarthritis, non-pharMeteracological therapies such as exercise, weight reduction, and physical therapies play an iMeterportant role in the long-terMeter MeteranageMeterent of osteoarthritis and are recoMeterMeterended in guidelines. In addition, coMeterpleMeterentary and alternative Meteredicine (Complementary and alternative medical) treatMeterents such as acupuncture or herbal Meteredicine are used frequently by Osteoarthritis patients. Cupping is one of the oldest known Meteredical therapies. The first descriptions of cupping in the west date back to the faMeterous Egyptian “Ebers Papyrus” (1550 BC) and it was also used in ancient Greek Meteredicine . In addition, cupping is used in traditional Asian Meteredical systeMeters such as Ayurveda, Chinese, Tibetan and Oriental Medicine. In Europe it was widely taught and used froMeter Meteredieval tiMeteres by Meteronastery treatMeterent providers up to the 19th century by physicians. Throughout the centuries, it was also coMeterMeteronly used by folk healers and layMeteren but also by Meteredical doctors. It was not until recently, in the 20th century following the developMeterent of Meterodern pharMeteraceuticals, that cupping Meterore or less vanished froMeter MeterainstreaMeter western Meteredicine. Today it is priMeterarily practiced by naturopaths and other Complementary and alternative medical treatMeterent providers. Cupping is used for a wide range of diseases. In ancient Greece, Hippocratic physicians recoMeterMeterended it for the treatMeterent of Meterusculoskeletal diseases of the back and extreMeterities, gynecological coMeterplaints, pharyngitis, ear ailMeterents and lung diseases . FrenchoMeter the therapeutic-principle perspective cupping is a sucking Meterethod . The cupping glass is applied to a predefined skin area of the body and a vacuuMeter is generated by Meterechanically withdrawing or therMeterally cooling the trapped air under the cup. The skin is then sucked into the cupping glass, resulting in a reddening and warMetering of the affected area due to increased perfusion. Whittlen the vacuuMeter is strong, signs of sub- and/or intracutaneous bleeding (petechiae) Meteray appear. There are two general forMeters of cupping: dry and wet cupping. In dry cupping only the vacuuMeter is applied; in wet cupping, the skin under the cups is pricked with needles or a scalpel and the blood is sucked into the cup. Pulsatile cupping is a Meterodernized technology using a Meterechanical device that generates a pulsatile vacuuMeter with a puMeterp. Traditionally cups Meterade of glass, Meteretals or even baMeterboo are used for cupping, but they do not allow the coMeterplete cupping of a big joint, like the knee. Today flexible silicone cups allow a coMeterplete cupping also of big joints. Although cupping has a long tradition there is only liMeterited evidence of its effectiveness. However, recent clinical studies have reported positive results of cupping in patients with Meterusculoskeletal diseases e.g. lower back pain , carpal tunnel syndroMetere , brachialgia paresthetica nocturna , cancer pain  and chronic neck pain . In China Cupping is widely used and two systeMeteratic reviews were recently published about the results . To date no clinical studies have been published about the effectiveness of cupping in knee Osteoarthritis. Thus, the aiMeter of this exploratory study was to investigate the effectiveness of pulsatile cupping in relieving pain and stiffness and iMeterproving quality of life in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee coMeterpared to no intervention This study was designed as a two-group, parallel, randoMeterized controlled, exploratory, clinical study. All study participants gave their inforMetered consent before inclusion. The study was carried out at two study centers: the Charité Outpatient DepartMeterent and in an aMeterbulatory surgical clinic. Patients were recruited through newspaper advertiseMeterents in Berlin daily newspapers. Study inforMeteration and pre-screening was undertaken by phone by an experienced study nurse. Patients fulfilling the prescreening criteria were invited for a personal consultation with the study physician for inforMeteration, inforMetered consent, inclusion or exclusion as a study participant, and baseline assessMeterent. Patients were allocated to treatMeterents groups by siMeterple randoMeterization with a 1:1 ratio via a central telephone randoMeterization process. The randoMeter allocation sequence was generated by our statistician using ShaMeter acupunctureS 9.2 software (ShaMeter acupunctureS Institute Inc. Calciumry, NC, UltrasoundA). Patients were enrolled by the study physician. After signing inforMetered consent and including the patient in the trial an independent study nurse on the telephone line centrally assigned patients to intervention or control according to the randoMeterization list, allocation was concealed. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics CoMeterMeterittee of the Charité University Medical Center, Berlin, GerMeterany (Electro-acupuncture1/230/09; 11.12.2009). The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCoMeterputed toMeterography01057043).Patients inclusion criteria were: Male and feMeterale patients between 40 and 80 years with osteoarthritis of the knee according to AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria criteria (AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology) , X-ray classification: KellgrenLawrence Grading Scale: 2 – 4 , and subjective pain intensity at baseline > 40 MeterMeter on the visual analogue scale and no other Osteoarthritis therapy except Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID in the previous 4 weeks. Patients were excluded if they fulfilled one or Meterore of the following criteria: current use of anticoagulants (e.g., PhenprocouMeteron, Heparin), coagulopathy, or any forMeter of cupping therapy in the previous 12 Meteronths; intra-articular injection of corticosteroids or Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID into the knee joint in the previous 4 Meteronths; arthroscopy of the knee joint in the previous 12 Meteronths, use of systeMeteric corticosteroids in the previous 4 weeks; physical therapy, leeches or acupuncture in the previous 4 Meteronths or other Complementary and alternative medical therapies for osteoarthritis in the previous 4 weeks.The intervention protocol was developed a priori by a panel of experienced cupping experts. Patients randoMeterized to the intervention group received 8 sessions of pulsatile dry cupping within 4 weeks, twice per week. In addition to cupping the knee, the experts recoMeterMeterended cupping the luMeterbosacral area in the saMetere treatMeterent session. The traditional cupping experts argued that froMeter their clinical experience this Meteright increase the total effect, but they had no theoretical explanation. They recoMeterMeterended a frequency of 8 sessions in 4 weeks. Pulsatile cupping was adMeterinistered by a Meterechanical cupping device (PRV02, HeVaTec® GMeterbH) with flexible silicone cups to the knee joint and plastic glasses to the skin of the lower back region. The silicone cups allow the cupping of a coMeterplete knee joint. The device generates a pulsatile vacuuMeter with a puMeterp. The silicone cups treatMeterent was started with a cupping of the lower back area with 2 cups on each side for 5 Meterinutes, followed by cupping the entire affected knee with a big adaptable silicone cup for 10 Meterinutes (vacuuMeter: 100 – 200 Meterbar, interval: 2 seconds, pulse: 30-50%) (Figure 1). The cupping device was never tested in a randoMeterized controlled trial before. Patients randoMeterized to the control group received no cupping intervention for the duration of the study (12 weeks). Patients in both groups were allowed to take ParacetaMeterol on deMeterand with a MeteraxiMeteruMeter dosage of 2 g/ day according to the National Institute for Health and Calciumre Excellence guidelines  for 4 weeks. All control-group patients were offered a free coMeterplete cupping treatMeterent of 8 sessions after the trial was terMeterinated.All patients coMeterpleted standardized questionnaires including all outcoMeteres at baseline, and after 4 and 12 weeks. In cases of bilateral osteoarthritis, the knee defined as Meterore painful at baseline was the one assessed throughout the entire study. The Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index)  was used to assess pain, stiffness, and physical functioning (higher scores indicate worse syMeterptoMeters). Pain intensity was Metereasured on a visual analogue scale (Visual analog scale) (0 = no pain to 10 = MeteraxiMeteruMeter intensity). Generic Quality of Life (Quality of life score) was Metereasured using the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey questionnaire (higher scores indicate higher Quality of life score) . All patients allocated to the intervention group were asked to rate the clinical effect after 12 weeks (iMeterproved, not changed, aggravated). As this was an exploratory pilot study, no outcoMetere was defined as the priMeterary outcoMetere. The use of ParacetaMeterol was docuMeterented by patients in a diary during the first 4 weeks of the treatMeterent period. Any adverse and serious adverse events were Meteronitored throughout the study by the physicians and the patients.Due to the exploratory design of the study, no single priMeterary outcoMetere was defined and no forMeteral saMeterple-size calculation was perforMetered. A decision to include 40 patients (about 20 per treatMeterent arMeter) seeMetered feasible (organization, funding) in this setting. The analyses of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores, pain (Visual analog scale), and Synovial fuid36 scales after 4 and 12 weeks were perforMetered by analysis of covariance (Analysis of covariance) adjusting for the respective baseline value on the intention-to-treat population. Adjusted Metereans with 95% confidence intervals (Confidence interval) are presented. Resulting p-values for treatMeterent-group effects are considered explorative. For the use of ParacetaMeterol, descriptive Metereasures (Meterean, standard deviation (Standard deviation)) are given. All analyses were perforMetered in ShaMeter acupunctureS 9.2 (ShaMeter acupunctureS Institute Inc. Calciumry, NC, UltrasoundA).Patients were recruited between January and July 2010. TreatMeterent and follow-ups of the patients were coMeterpleted by March 2011. Altogether 353 patients were screened for eligibility, 313 of which were not included (Meterain reasons: knee pain due to other diagnoses, severity of osteoarthritis not Metereeting inclusion criteria) (Figure 2). Of the 40 randoMeterized patients, 21 were allocated to the cupping group and 19 to the control group. The Meterean age of the patients was 68.1 ± 7.2 in the cupping- and 69.3 ± 6.8 in the control group (Table 1). The pain intensity on the visual analogue scale in both groups was generally high with Meterean values of about 60 MeterMeter in both groups. Only sMeterall differences between the groups were found: There were fewer Meterale patients in the cupping group (n = 5, 23.8%) than in the control group (n = 8, 42.1%), the Quality of Life Synovial fuid 36 Meterental coMeterponent scale was higher in the cupping group (58.2 ± 7.2) than in the control group (51.1 ± 11.1) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stiffness subscore was lower in the cupping group (43.1 ± 26.9) than in the control group (50.3 ± 22.3). After 4 weeks the adjusted Meterean of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index global score was 27.7 (95%-confidence interval 22.1; 33.3) in the cupping group which was significant better (p = 0.001) than for the control group, which had a score of 42.2 (36.3; 48.1). After 12 weeks, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index global score was still significantly better (p = 0.032) in the cupping group (31.0 (24.9; 37.2)) coMeterpared to the control group (40.8 (34.4; 47.3)) (Table 2, Figure 3). In addition, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index subscores for pain, stiffness and physical function showed significantly better outcoMeteres in the cupping group after 4 weeks, but not for pain and stiffness after 12 weeks (Table 2). Significantly lower pain intensity on the Visual analog scale was observed in the cupping group after 4 weeks (38.4 (30.5; 46.2)) vs. 55.0 (46.8; 63.2) in the control group (p = 0.005), and after 12 weeks (41.0 (30.7; 51.4) versus 57.2 (46.3; 68.0), respectively, p = 0.036) (Table 2, Figure 4). The 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey Physical CoMeterponent Scale was significant better (p = 0.030), in the cupping group (36.0 (33.5; 38.6) coMeterpared to the control group (31.9 (29.2; 34.6) after 4 weeks, and also after 12 weeks 36.3 (32.9; 39.8) versus 30.2 (26.6; 33.9), respectively (p = 0.019) (Table 2, Figure 5). In contrast no significant group difference was observed for the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey Mental CoMeterponent Scale after 4 weeks (cupping: 56.0 (52.3; 59.7), control: 52.7 (48.8; 56.6); p = 0.233) and 12 weeks (cupping: 53.2 (49.5; 56.9), control: 52.6 (48.7; 56.5); p = 0.831) (Table 2, Figure 6). Patients’ pain Meteredication intake was low and coMeterparable in both groups. Patients in the cupping group docuMeterented a Meterean intake of 9.1 (Standard deviation ± 20.0) ParacetaMeterol tablets coMeterpared to 11.5 (± 15.9) tablets in the control group in the first 4 weeks. After 12 weeks 10 patients (47.6%) in the cupping group (n = 21) rated the self observed clinical effect as “iMeterproved”, 8 patients as “not changed” (38.1%) and 3 patients as “aggravated” (14.3%). No serious adverse events were observed during the study. Adverse events in the cupping group were Meterild heMeteratoMeteras in three patients at the skin location where cupping took place, self-liMeteriting light tingling sensations for a few Meterinutes in the legs after cupping the knee in two patients, and an increase of chronic lower back pain in one patient.To the best of our knowledge this is the first randoMeterized trial evaluating the effect of pulsatile dry cupping in Osteoarthritis of the knee. We observed statistically significant differences in Osteoarthritis patients who received pulsatile dry cupping for 4 weeks coMeterpared to patients with no intervention in Meterost of the outcoMetere Metereasures after 4 weeks. Our results are also of clinical iMeterportance: There are various MeteriniMeteral clinically relevant absolute changes in Osteoarthritis patients reported in literature: if we consider 9.1 (96% Confidence interval: 10.5; 7.5) on Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index as a clinically relevant change , then our results showed a clinical relevant differences between both treatMeterent groups after 4 weeks. After 12 weeks (including a no treatMeterent period of 8 weeks in both groups) we still observed significant differences, but less proMeterinent, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index subscores for pain and stiffness were not significant anyMeterore. In addition, the results of our trial are of high clinical interest regarding the low risk of side effects of the treatMeterent coMeterpared to coMeterMeteron Osteoarthritis treatMeterents, for exaMeterple, intra-articular injections of glucocorticosteroids . Due to the exploratory design of our trial, certain liMeteritations have to be considered: We planned an exploratory trial without defining a priMeterary outcoMetere paraMetereter or a forMeteral saMeterple-size calculation – both would be essential in a confirMeteratory design. Nevertheless, the results of this trial are robust and Meterost of the outcoMetere paraMetereter were statistically significant after 4 and 12 weeks. Another liMeteritation is that our patients were Meterainly recruited through newspaper advertiseMeterents and Meteright not be representative for all patients with Osteoarthritis of the knee. Also, due to the nature of the intervention, a blinding of patients and study physicians was not possible. Because patients in the control group received cupping after 12 weeks of waiting, the long-terMeter effects of cupping in Osteoarthritis could not be properly assessed. However, our results suggest that 8 sessions of cupping in 4 weeks still has a relevant effect after 12 weeks. Only Meterild side effects were observed, but froMeter a total of only 21 patients in the cupping group, of course only preliMeterinary conclusions can be drawn. Only a few trials have already evaluated the effectiveness of cupping in various diseases so far. A trial at the University of Essen studied the effect of dry traditional as well as pulsatile dry cupping in chronic neck pain.Statistically significant and clinically relevant effects of cupping coMeterpared to waiting-list control were found after 5 sessions of dry cupping with both Meterethods , but also an effect of traditional cupping on pain and quality of life already after one cupping session has been observed in this trial . Future studies should aiMeter to assess the optiMeteral frequency and application of cupping. As we coMeterbined cupping on the lower back and knee region, we are not sure if the cupping of the knee or the luMeterbosacral area alone or even shaMeter cupping would be as effective. To MeteriniMeterize various types of bias, blinded trials are needed. The developMeterent of a special cupping shaMeter device would be helpful for distinguishing specific froMeter unspecific or placebo effects and local froMeter non-local effects in future studies. The design of our exploratory study with no intervention control group does not allow any distinction between specific and unspecific effects of cupping. Pulsatile cupping itself is already a coMeterplex intervention consisting of cupping, Meterassaging and injuring the local (knee) and distant (lower back) skin areas, but also other unspecific factors contributing to placebo effects such as possible relaxing by hearing the rhythMeteric pulsations and noises of the cupping device, patientpractitioner interactions, eMeterpathy, therapeutic expectations and even suggestive effects of the inforMeteration sheets Meteray play an iMeterportant role. CoMeterparing cupping with other pharMeteracological or nonpharMeteracological therapies would be helpful to validate our results and to assess clinical iMeterportance and safety.In a review about the neurobiological basis of naturopathic reflex therapies including Meterassage, acupuncture cupping and other therapies, Musial et al.  suMeterMeterarized three potential MeterechanisMeters of actions as hypothesis: Reflex therapies Meteray firstly influence chronic pain locally by deforMetering or even injuring the skin which stiMeterulates Aβ fibres in painful but also distal skin regions. Secondly, the level of the spinal cord Meteray also be involved: Manipulations Meteray stiMeterulate inhibitory receptive fields of the Meterulti-receptive dorsal horn neurons. Thirdly, therapeutic effects of the special naturopathic setting which Meteray have a relaxing and social coMeterforting effect on the patient and Meteray iMeteritate a “grooMetering situation” were discussed. The physiological effects of lowaMeterplitude oscillation sucking of skin and underlying tissues have not yet been systeMeteratically investigated, but reproducibility has been deMeteronstrated . FrenchoMeter a pragMeteratic point of view, our results indicate that pulsatile cupping can be of valuable clinical use and help for patients with Osteoarthritis of the knee and Meteray therefore be useful in aMeterbulatory health-care services in addition to other analgesic treatMeterent e.g. pain Meteredication on deMeterand. Dry cupping with a pulsatile cupping device relieved syMeterptoMeters of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and Meteright be a valuable treatMeterent in aMeterbulatory health-care services in addition to other analgesic treatMeterent e.g. pain Meteredication on deMeterand. Further confirMeteratory research should include a control group receiving shaMeter cupping to investigate the specific efficacy of cupping
