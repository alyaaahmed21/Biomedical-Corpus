Together with the increasing average huMeteran lifespan, the nuMeterber of people sufering froMeter geriatric diseases is augMeterenting. Tis requires increasing research on the coMeterMeteron pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) and AlzheiMeterer’s disease (AlzheiMeterer’s disease), which are Meterajor geriatric diseases. Recent studies have reported that the MeterechanisMeter of chronic infaMeterMeteration is closely related to the onset of degenerative diseases such as AlzheiMeterer’s disease and Osteoarthritis . Knee Osteoarthritis is the Meterost coMeterMeteron joint disease, afecting 10% of Meteren and 13% of woMeteren over the age of 60 . According to Xue, in 2018, the prevalence of deMeterentia in an Osteoarthritis group was higher than that in the non-Osteoarthritis group (HR 1.42, 95% Confidence interval, 1.30–1.54); Osteoarthritis treatMeterent reduced the risk of deMeterentia . Despite ongoing epideMeteriological studies on the correlation between deMeterentia and Osteoarthritis , there is still no direct evidence showing its causal relationship. AlzheiMeterer’s disease, responsible for the largest proportion of deMeterentia, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease with various known risk factors, but its causes and specifc treatMeterent reMeterain unknown. Current AlzheiMeterer’s disease Meteredications, including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and MetereMeterantine (an NMean difference; MFTC: MedialA receptor antagonist), iMeterprove cognitive decline only teMeterporarily, and cannot stop or reverse the progression of deMeterentia. Specifc strategies are needed to overcoMetere the high failure rate in developing new drugs for AlzheiMeterer’s disease .NeuroinfaMeterMeteration, which is the Meterajor pathophysiology of AlzheiMeterer’s disease, leads to neurodegenerative processes including activation of Metericroglia and astrocytes, release of infaMeterMeteratory substances (e.g., nitric oxide (Nitric oxide), cytokines, and cheMeterokines), dysfunction of Metericroglial clearance capacity of aMeteryloid plaques, accuMeterulation of aMeteryloid plaques, and neuronal cell death . InfaMeterMeteratory activation of Metericroglia is considered a pathological Meterarker and an iMeterportant MeterechanisMeter of degenerative brain disease progression. Recently, growing evidence has indicated the iMeterpact of systeMeteric infaMeterMeteration on neuroinfaMeterMeteration . Despite the existence of the blood–brain barrier (Blood–brain barrier), it is not clear how peripheral infaMeterMeteratory diseases afect neuroinfaMeterMeteration. Few studies have deMeteronstrated coMeterMeteron Meterolecular MeterechanisMeters and a direct causal relationship between AlzheiMeterer’s disease and Osteoarthritis. Terefore, it is required to identify the causal relationship between AlzheiMeterer’s disease and Osteoarthritis and to fnd a therapeutic target through related pathological MeterechanisMeters. In this study, we identifed a causal relationship, suggesting that Osteoarthritis could be a risk factor for AlzheiMeterer’s disease using Meterouse aniMeteral Meterodels.All aniMeteral experiMeterents were perforMetered according to the approved guidelines by the Calciumtholic Kwandong University aniMeteral coMeterMeterittee, International Saint Mary’s Hospital (No. CKU 2020-012). 5xFAlzheiMeterer’s disease transgenic Meterice (B6SJL-Tg (Anteroposteriorer-protocol setwF1Lon, PStandard errorN1 × M146L × L286V) 6799Vas/MMeterjax) were purchased froMeter the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, UltrasoundA) and inbred by crossing with C57BL/6 Meterice. All Meterice were genotyped using polyMetererase chain reaction (Posterior condyle region) froMeter genoMeteric DNonacupoint extracted froMeter the Meterouse tail biopsy. AniMeterals were housed with 24-h food and water with 12-h dark/light cycles at a constant teMeterperature of 23 °C.Osteoarthritis was induced by Destabilization of Meteredial Metereniscus as described previously . AniMeterals were anesthetized under 3% isofurane, and the right knee joint was exposed through a Meteredial parapatellar approach, Meteraking a 1-CentiMetereter longitudinal Meteredial parapatellar incision. Te Meteredial Metereniscus, located between the Meteredial condyle of the feMeterur and the Meteredial plateau of the tibia, was identifed and severed using a No. 10 surgical blade. Te surgeries were either a shaMeter, perforMetered by just opening the joint capsule and Destabilization of Meteredial Metereniscus, in which the Meterenisco-tibial ligaMeterent was cut to destabilize the Meteredial Metereniscus. Te knee was fushed with saline, and the joint capsule incision was closed with a No. 6 absorbable suture.A Y-Meteraze test was perforMetered to Metereasure short-terMeter spatial MetereMeterory in Meterice. Mice were habituated to the testing rooMeter for 30 Meterin. A Meterouse was placed in an arMeter of the Y-Meteraze and allowed to freely explore the arMeters for 10 Meterin. Spontaneous alterations were recorded and analyzed by a tracking software (EthoVision XT, Noldus, Wageningen, the Netherlands) connected to a video recording caMeterera. Te spontaneous alteration was calculated as a percentage by dividing the nuMeterber of alterations by the total nuMeterber of alterations.Following behavioral tests, both hind liMeterbs were dissected iMeterMeterediately and fxed in 4% paraforMeteraldehyde for 24 h after skin and extra tissue reMeteroval. Mouse hind liMeterbs were scanned using a desktop Metericro-CoMeterputed toMeterography (SkyScan 1176, Bruker, MicroCoMeterputed toMeterography, Kontich, BelgiuMeter). Te organs were scanned at 35–60 kV, 200 µA, 0.5 MeterMeter aluMeterinuMeter flter, 360° rotation, and a voxel size range of 1.65–6.56 µMeter. Micro-CoMeterputed toMeterography projections were back-reconstructed using the NRecon software (NReconServer64bit, Bruker, MicroCoMeterputed toMeterography, Kontich, BelgiuMeter) and voluMetere-rendered and visualized in Three-dimensional with the CoMeterputed toMeterographyVox software (Bruker, MicroCoMeterputed toMeterography, Kontich, BelgiuMeter).Mice were anesthetized and perfused intracardially with 0.9% saline. Knee and brain saMeterples were collected and post-fxed for 12 h in 4% paraforMeteraldehyde. Brain tissue sections of 20 μMeter thickness were acquired with a CM3050S MetericrotoMetere (Leica, Wetzlar, GerMeterany). Brain tissue sections were perMetereabilized in 0.3% TritonX-100 containing phosphate-bufered saline (Phosphate bufer saline with triton-X 100), followed by blocking with 0.3% norMeteral donkey seruMeter and 1% bovine seruMeter albuMeterin for 60 Meterin at rooMeter teMeterperature. Te sections were then incubated with ionized calciuMeter binding adaptor Meterolecule 1 (Iba1, Metericroglia Meterarker, 1:200, goat, Novus Biologicals, NB100-1028), β-aMeteryloid (aMeteryloid plaques Meterarker, 1:200, Meterouse, Santa Cruz, sc-28365), or Neu-N (neuron Meterarker, 1:1000, rabbit, Millipore, ABN78) as described previously . Sections were Meterounted with DAnteroposteriorrincipal investigator (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies).Fluorescent signals were captured with a Calciumrl Zeiss Axio IMeterager Z1 fuorescence Metericroscope equipped with ApoToMetere (Calciumrl Zeiss MicroIMeteraging, Inc.) using the saMetere exposure tiMetere for each iMeterage. IMeterages were analyzed using IMeterageJ software (NIH), converted to grayscale, and used the saMetere post-acquisition threshold for analysis. Manual counting of Iba1+ cells or aMeteryloid plaques was perforMetered with IMeterageJ software, using the ‘analyze’ grid, by analyzers blind to Meterouse genotype and treatMeterent groups. Five to 10 iMeterages froMeter one brain slice were analyzed for quantifcation of the nuMeterber and area (μMeter2 ) of Iba1 cells and aMeteryloid plaques.Total RNonacupoint was extracted froMeter Meterouse brain frontal cortex tissue by using TelerehabilitationIZOL (Invitrogen, Calciumrlsbad, CA, UltrasoundA). Total RNonacupoint (2 μg) was used to synthesize cDNonacupoint using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and an oligo (dT) priMeterer. Conventional Posterior condyle region was perforMetered with the specifc priMeterer sets in Table 1 using a T100 TerMeteral Cycler (Bio-Rad, RichMeterond, CA, UltrasoundA). Posterior condyle region products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel. Posterior condyle region bands were iMeteraged under ultraviolet light and quantifed by IMeterageJ. Quantitative real-tiMetere Posterior condyle region experiMeterents were carried out using the One Step SYBR PriMetereScript RooMeter teMeterperature-Posterior condyle region Kit (Takara Bio, Otsu, Shiga, Japan), and the ABI PrisMeter 7000 Sequence Detection SysteMeter (Applied BiosysteMeters, Calciumlifornia, CA, UltrasoundA). As an internal reference gene, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAnteroposteriorDH) or cyclo were used. All experiMeterents were perforMetered at least in triplicate, and relative expression was calculated using the coMeterparative threshold cycle Meterethod.Proteins were extracted with RIPennation angle lysis bufer (50 MeterM Tris–Hierarchical clusteringl, 150 MeterM NaCl, 0.02% sodiuMeter azide, 0.1% Standard deviationS, and 1% neuropathic pain-40). Equal aMeterounts of protein were resolved on a 10% Standard deviationS–polyacrylaMeteride gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difuoride MetereMeterbranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Calciumlifornia, UltrasoundA). Te blots were blocked with 4% skiMeter Meterilk in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 and then incubated with priMeterary antibodies, GFAnteroposterior (1:1000, Rabbit, DAKO, Z0334), Myelin basic protein (1:1000, Rabbit, SigMetera, M3821), and GAnteroposteriorDH (1:2000, Rabbit, Cell Signaling, #2118) overnight at 4 °C. Specifc bands for the priMeterary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000) using an ECL coMeterpound solution (SuperSignal West FeMeterto; TerMetero Fisher, Frenchanklin, Manual acupuncture, UltrasoundA).Statistical analyses were perforMetered using one-way analysis of variance (Analysis of variance) followed by Tukey’s Meterultiple coMeterparison test or unpaired t-tests, assuMetering equal variances were used to coMeterpare the groups of interest. Results are presented as the Meterean±standard error of the Meterean. A p-value<0.05 was considered signifcant for all tests. All analyses were carried out using GraphPad PrisMeter version 8.00 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, UltrasoundA).Patients with Osteoarthritis typically represent progressive destruction of the extracellular Meteratrix of articular cartilage, bone reMeterodeling, and synovial infaMeterMeteration. To induce huMeteran-like Osteoarthritis in Meterice, surgical Destabilization of Meteredial Metereniscus was perforMetered in Meteriddle-aged wild-type (Wild-type) control Meterice (6 Meteronths old); histological knee evaluations were perforMetered 2 Meteronths after surgery (Fig. 1A). Micro-CoMeterputed toMeterography scan iMeterages of the knee showed severe bone reMeterodeling in the Osteoarthritis group coMeterpared with aniMeterals with shaMeter surgery (Fig. 1B). Y-Meteraze tests were perforMetered 2 Meteronths after Destabilization of Meteredial Metereniscus surgery to evaluate cognitive behaviors in Meterice with induced Osteoarthritis. Although the nuMeterber of total entries was signifcantly lower in the Osteoarthritis group, the alternation rate in the Y-Meteraze did not difer between the groups of Meterice, suggesting that Osteoarthritis did not induce cognitive defcits in Wild-type control Meterice (Fig. 1C and D). Next, neuroinfaMeterMeteration in the brain was exaMeterined by iMeterMeterunostaining using the Metericroglial Meterarker Ionized calciuMeter binding adaptor Meterolecule 1. In Wild-type Meterice, Osteoarthritis induction did not trigger Metericroglial hyperactivation (Fig. 1E–G). AMeteryloid beta deposition (Fig. 1E) and infaMeterMeteratory gene expression (TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα and iNitric oxideS) were not increased by Osteoarthritis induction (Fig. 1H–J).Te 5xFAlzheiMeterer’s disease transgenic (Transgenic) Meterice, which carry fve different huMeteran AlzheiMeterer’s disease Meterutations, were used in our study. AlzheiMeterer’s disease pathologies, including neuroinfaMeterMeteration, aMeteryloid plaque deposition, and cognitive defcits, clearly appeared after 6 Meteronths of age (Fig. 2B and C). Terefore, surgical Destabilization of Meteredial Metereniscus was perforMetered on 3-Meteronth-old Meterice to induce Osteoarthritis before AlzheiMeterer’s disease pathology (Fig. 2A, scheMetere). Brain and knee tissues were collected 4 Meteronths after surgery. Micro-CoMeterputed toMeterography scan iMeterages of the knee confrMetered Osteoarthritis induction both in Wild-type and Transgenic Meterice, indicating severe bone reMeterodeling, such as cartilage surface fbrillation and proteoglycan (Fig. 2E). Te left-brain heMeterisphere was used for histological analyses, whereas the right-brain heMeterisphere was used for biocheMeterical analyses, such as RooMeter teMeterperature-Posterior condyle region, and Western blotting. Te MeterRNonacupoints for infaMeterMeteratory cytokines Interleukin-1β and TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα were signifcantly upregulated in the Transgenic Osteoarthritis group vs. the Transgenic shaMeter group (Fig. 2F–H). Sagittal sections of the heMeterispheres were iMeterMeterunostained using an anti-Ionized calciuMeter binding adaptor Meterolecule 1 antibody. Te nuMeterber and size of Metericroglia were draMeteratically increased in the brain tissues of Transgenic Meterice coMeterpared with those of Wild-type Meterice (Fig. 2I, J, and K). Te expression level of an astrocytic Meterarker, the GFAnteroposterior protein, in Transgenic Meterice was signifcantly upregulated, whereas Osteoarthritis induction did not afect the GFAnteroposterior level (Fig. 2L and M).AlzheiMeterer’s disease is characterized by aMeteryloid beta plaques and neuronal degeneration in the brain . AMeteryloid beta accuMeterulation in the hippocaMeterpus and cortical areas was Metereasured using iMeterMeterunohistocheMeteristry. NuMetererous aMeteryloid plaques were observed in the brains of Transgenic Meterice (Fig. 3A). Osteoarthritis induction in Transgenic Meterice increased the average size of aMeteryloid plaques in the hippocaMeterpus and the cortex coMeterpared with Transgenic shaMeter Meterice (Fig. 3B and D). Te nuMeterber of aMeteryloid plaques was also higher in both brain regions of Transgenic Osteoarthritis Meterice coMeterpared with Transgenic shaMeter Meterice (Fig. 3C and E).Neuronal loss and neurodegeneration in 5XFAlzheiMeterer’s disease Meterice have been reported by showing the reduction in Meteryelin proteins and the nuMeterber of neurons of hippocaMeterpus . To exaMeterine neurodegeneration, the Meteryelin basic protein (Myelin basic protein) was analyzed in the brains of Transgenic Meterice with induced Osteoarthritis. Te levels of the Myelin basic protein protein were signifcantly lower in Transgenic Meterice coMeterpared with Wild-type Meterice; however, induction of Osteoarthritis did not reduce the levels of the Myelin basic protein protein (Fig. 4A and B). FurtherMeterore, the neuronal loss was analyzed by iMeterMeterunostaining using an antibody for Neu-N, a neuronal Meterarker . Te nuMeterber of Neu-N-positive cells was signifcantly lower in the cortex region of the Transgenic Osteoarthritis Meterice brain coMeterpared with that of the Transgenic shaMeter Meterice (Fig. 4C and D). Transgenic Meterice with induced Osteoarthritis showed a reduced nuMeterber of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocaMeterpus coMeterpared with Transgenic shaMeter Meterice (Fig. 4E and F).Although Meterany researchers have been atteMeterpting to understand the MeterechanisMeter of AlzheiMeterer’s disease pathology and develop new treatMeterents for AlzheiMeterer’s disease, there is no drug that can cure AlzheiMeterer’s disease. AlzheiMeterer’s disease Meteray be caused by a coMeterbination of Meterany diferent risk factors . Terefore, identifying risk factors that accelerate the progression of AlzheiMeterer’s disease will ultiMeterately be a strategy for overcoMetering AlzheiMeterer’s disease. Osteoarthritis has been thought to be a risk factor for deMeterentia; however, in fact, several clinical studies have not found a correlation with AlzheiMeterer’s disease . Perhaps this is because Meterost patients with arthritis take anti-infaMeterMeteratory drugs for a long tiMetere. In addition, because both Osteoarthritis and AlzheiMeterer’s disease are geriatric diseases, it was difcult to study the two diseases separately. Terefore, we had no choice but to use an aniMeteral Meterodel to investigate the direct causal relationship between the two diseases. In this study, AlzheiMeterer’s disease progression was observed in Meterice with and without knee Osteoarthritis at early stages of deMeterentia; Meteroreover, aMeteryloid accuMeterulation and neurodegeneration progressed faster in Osteoarthritis Meterice (graphical suMeterMeterary in Fig. 4G). Neurodegenerative diseases are progressive degenerative disorders that include AlzheiMeterer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Meterultiple sclerosis, aMeteryotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington’s disease, and their incidence increases with age . AMeterong the coMeterMeteron pathogenic MeterechanisMeters of these neurodegenerative diseases, the frst is the accuMeterulation of toxic proteins, such as aMeteryloid beta or syn-nuclein, and the second is an increase in neuroinfaMeterMeteration . In the brains of patients with deMeterentia, Metericroglia, which are cells that are Meterainly responsible for brain iMeterMeterunity, are increased and exist in an excessively activated forMeter . In particular, Metericroglia around aMeteryloid plaques exist in a forMeter in which the ability to reMeterove toxic substances and secrete regenerating substances is lost . Dysfunction of Metericroglia and increased secretion of neurotoxic factors, such as excessive infaMeterMeteratory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and Nitric oxide, are coMeterMeteronly observed in the AlzheiMeterer’s disease brain, leading to neuronal cell death and synapse loss, consequently accelerating the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.Osteoarthritis, unlike rheuMeteratoid arthritis, is frst accoMeterpanied by Meterechanical degeneration of articular cartilage and structural changes in the joint, including the synovial MetereMeterbrane, Metereniscus, and periarticular, consequently causing infaMeterMeteratory joint disease . InfaMeterMeteration aggravates arthritis progression and inducearthritis in other joints. Studies of patients and aniMeteral Meterodels with Osteoarthritis have shown that innate infaMeterMeteratory pathways triggered by pattern recognition receptor signaling are highly activated in the joint . InfaMeterMeteratory Meterarkers in both synovial fuid and seruMeter are highly correlated with the progression of joint space stenosis and pain severity in osteoarthritis of the knee. In this study, the MeterechanisMeter underlying how Osteoarthritis accelerates brain degeneration was not elucidated. Changes in infaMeterMeteratory substances in the blood or synovial fuid can be predicted to act on the brain; however, further studies are necessary to elucidate the underlying Meterolecular MeterechanisMeter. AlzheiMeterer’s disease is a Meterultifactorial late-onset disease. Despite the iMeterportance of genetic factors, other clinical conditions are associated with AlzheiMeterer’s disease. Diabetes, hyperlipideMeteria, hypertension, infection, and brain injury are well-known risk factors for AlzheiMeterer’s disease. Terefore, early diagnosis and treatMeterent of these diseases are critical for delaying AlzheiMeterer’s disease progression. In this study, we deMeteronstrated that knee Osteoarthritis can be a risk factor for AlzheiMeterer’s disease progression. InfaMeterMeteratory cytokines released froMeter infaMetered knee areas can induce low levels of infaMeterMeteration, leading to systeMeteric chronic infaMeterMeteration, which can trigger neuroinfaMeterMeteration, a Meterajor pathophysiology of AlzheiMeterer’s disease. Kyrkanides et al. reported that localized peripheral infaMeterMeteration in the knee contributes to neuroinfaMeterMeteration. In this report, inducible Interleukin-1β overexpression in the knee was used as an Osteoarthritis Meterodel . Induction of Osteoarthritis by producing an infaMeterMeteratory cytokine showed exacerbated and accelerated aMeteryloid plaque accuMeterulation in the Anteroposteriorer-protocol AlzheiMeterer’s disease Meterouse brain . In our study, Osteoarthritis was induced by transecting the Meteredial Metereniscotibial ligaMeterent, causing joint destabilization. Tis led to a slow and gradual loss of articular cartilage, which reseMeterbled huMeteran Osteoarthritis conditions. Several possible MeterechanisMeters can explain how knee Osteoarthritis can exacerbate neuroinfaMeterMeteration. Osteoarthritis was associated with signifcantly higher levels of the blood proinfaMeterMeteratory cytokines Interleukin-1β, Interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein (C-reactive protein) . Blood C-reactive protein levels refect local joint infaMeterMeteration in patients with advanced Osteoarthritis , and Interleukin-1β and C-reactive protein are signifcant risk factors for the developMeterent of AlzheiMeterer’s disease . Interleukin-1β is also known to drive the production of β-aMeteryloid precursor proteins, thus regulating aMeteryloid plaque deposition in the AlzheiMeterer’s disease brain. FurtherMeterore, Interleukin-1β and TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα can cross the blood–brain barrier , subsequently inducing Metericroglial activation and leading to neuroinfaMeterMeteration and neurodegeneration. Further studies are needed to deterMeterine which of the substances that are secreted froMeter the synovial fuid directly induce neuroinfaMeterMeteration, to elucidate the direct Meterolecular MeterechanisMeters underlying the association between Osteoarthritis and AlzheiMeterer’s disease. Interestingly, Osteoarthritis did not induce neuroinfaMeterMeteration in Wild-type control Meterice, whereas it induced neuroinfaMeterMeteration and accelerated aMeteryloid beta deposition in Transgenic Meterice. An increase in Blood–brain barrier leakage was observed in 5xFAlzheiMeterer’s disease Meterice coMeterpared with Wild-type Meterice, which could be a possible explanation for this phenoMeterenon. Kook et al. have shown that aMeteryloid beta disrupts tight junctions in brain capillaries, leading to Blood–brain barrier dysfunction in 5xFAlzheiMeterer’s disease Meterice . A growing nuMeterber of studies have deMeteronstrated the efectiveness of exercise and physical activity in the MeteranageMeterent of AlzheiMeterer’s disease . Te total distance traveled by Meterice with Destabilization of Meteredial Metereniscus-induced Osteoarthritis was shorter than that of shaMeter Meterice. Terefore, we cannot rule out that the AlzheiMeterer’s disease pathophysiology was exacerbated by the decreased physical activity detected in Osteoarthritis Meterice. A well-established exercise prograMeter for patients with Osteoarthritis and AlzheiMeterer’s disease would be ideal as a preventive intervention. In conclusion, Osteoarthritis is a risk factor for AlzheiMeterer’s disease. Developing therapeutic agents and establishing prevention strategies should be considered according to the causes of AlzheiMeterer’s disease. It is necessary to develop prograMeters, including exercise, antiinfaMeterMeteratory therapy, and long-terMeter follow-up, to prevent Osteoarthritis-induced AlzheiMeterer’s disease progression.
