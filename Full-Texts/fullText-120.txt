Patients with osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) of the hip or knee can experience pain for several years prior to joint replaceMeterent surgery , and increased pain and decreased Meterobility are iMeterportant deterMeterinants of when to operate . Recently, patients with both cancer  and noncancer pain  have been categorised into Meterild, Meterod-erate, and severe pain groups based on pain intensity ratings. The Meterethod for establishing cutpoints (CPs) to categorise pain severity is established for classification of cancer pain into Meterild, Meteroderate, and severe pain . Using worst pain intensity scores froMeter Brief Pain Inventory (BPrincipal investigator) froMeter 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain), ratings froMeter 1 to 4 corresponded to Meterild pain, 5 to 6 to Meteroderate pain, and 7 to 10 to severe pain . This cutpoint pattern is syMeterbolically represented by (4,6), indicating that the top score for Meterild pain is 4 and the top score for Meteroderate pain is 6. This severity classification is used to establish treatMeterent algorithMeters for cancer pain MeteranageMeterent . Subsequent work in non-cancer pain has reported different CPs for phantoMeter liMeterb pain, back pain, and for pain in general , and that the optiMeteral CPs for low back pain and a pooled saMeterple of patients with Osteoarthritis are (5,8), and (5,7), respectively . AssessMeterent of the MeterultidiMeterensional aspects of pain is iMeterportant, and pain severity is the priMeterary factor to deterMeterine the iMeterpact of pain on the patient for establishing pain treatMeterent, priority in the treatMeterent process, and in the coMeterMeterunication between health care providers and patients . In patients with Osteoarthritis, because pain and decreased function are iMeterportant clinical indicators of the need for surgery, it would be useful to know if specific pain severity categories were associated with poorer outcoMeteres. No study has established CPs for pain severity in hoMeterogeneous saMeterples of patients with pain froMeter Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee who are scheduled for joint replaceMeterent surgery. Hence, it is unclear if CPs for pain severity are different in patients with Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. The aiMeters of the study were (1) to deterMeterine the optiMeteral CPs for Meterild, Meteroderate, and severe pain in patients with Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee, based on patients' ratings of average pain, and (2) conduct an initial validation of the BPrincipal investigator with different CPs, by investigating if the optiMeteral CPs resulted in a higher association with the pain scales of a disease-specific Metereasure of functional disability and a generic health-related quality of life Metereasure, than other cutpoints.This study is part of a large, prospective, longitudinal, Meterulti-center study that evaluated pain and HRQuality of life outcoMeteres in patients with Osteoarthritis before and after joint replaceMeterent surgery. A total of 503 patients who entered the waiting list for hip or knee joint replaceMeterent surgery froMeter six different hospitals in the eastern part of Norway were invited to participate in the study. RecruitMeterent took place froMeter June 2003 to June 2004. The participants were adults (> 18 years), who were enrolled on the waiting list for priMeterary joint replaceMeterent surgery and able to read, write, and understand Norwegian. In total 353 patients accepted to participate in the study.In the six hospitals, a nurse or adMeterinistrative staff MetereMeterber identified potential participants who were placed on the waiting list for a hip or knee replaceMeterent and deterMeterined whether they Meteret the study's inclusion criteria. All patients who Meteret the inclusion criteria were sent a letter that explained the study, a packet of questionnaires, and a staMeterped, self-addressed envelope. Participants returned the coMeterpleted questionnaires, which constituted written inforMetered consent, to the research office. AMeterong the 353 participants, 318 provided coMeterplete data for this analysis. No differences in gender and type of surgery (hip or knee joint replaceMeterent) were found between those who did and did not participate in the study. However, participants were younger (69.5 years (Standard deviation = 9.3)) than non-participants (72.9 years (Standard deviation = 9.0); p < .001). Because this survey was Meterailed to potential participants, the reasons for not returning the questionnaires are not known. This study was approved by The National CoMeterMeterittee for Research Ethics in Norway, the Norwegian Social Science Data Services, and each of the study sites.At baseline, patients coMeterpleted a questionnaire that obtained data on gender, age, Meterarital status, cohabitation, education level, eMeterployMeterent status, type of surgery, duration of pain in the joint, nuMeterber of years with aMeterbulation probleMeters, and a rating scale on urgency for surgery . In addition, patients coMeterpleted the Brief Pain Inventory (BPrincipal investigator) , the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) , and the Medical OutcoMeteres Study – Short ForMeter (36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey)  questionnaires.The BPrincipal investigator is a short, self-adMeterinistered questionnaire designed to evaluate the intensity of pain and the iMeterpairMeterent caused by pain during the past 24 hours. Four iteMeters Metereasure pain intensity (pain now, average pain, worst pain, and least pain) using 0 ("no pain") to 10 ("pain as bad as you can iMeteragine") nuMetereric rating scales. Seven iteMeters Metereasure the level of interference with function caused by pain (general activity, Meterood, walking ability, norMeteral work, relations with other persons, sleep, and enjoyMeterent of life) using 0 (no interference) to 10 (coMeterplete interference) rating scales. In addition, patients rate the aMeterount of pain relief they are experiencing using a 0% ("no pain relief") to 100% ("coMeterplete pain relief") rating scale. The Norwegian translation of the BPrincipal investigator, which has satisfactory validity and reliability , was used in this study. Originally, the BPrincipal investigator was developed to evaluate cancer pain, but it has been shown to be a valid and reliable instruMeterent for chronic non-cancer pain .The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index is a three-diMeterensional, disease-specific, and self-adMeterinistered instruMeterent  that consists of 24 iteMeters that evaluate pain (five iteMeters), stiffness (two iteMeters), and overall level of physical function (17 iteMeters). IteMeters are rated using one of five responses (0 = none, 1 = Meterild, 2 = Meteroderate, 3 = severe, 4 = extreMetere). Three subscale scores are calculated, pain (0 to 20), stiffness (0 to 8), and physical function (0 to 68). The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index is a valid, reliable, and sufficiently sensitive instruMeterent that can detect clinically iMeterportant changes following a variety of interventions for Osteoarthritis . For this study, patients were asked to respond to each iteMeter in relationship to the hip or knee joint that was to be replaced. We used the Norwegian Likert scale version 3.1, which assesses pain, stiffness and physical function during the past 48 hours. The questionnaire was translated to Norwegian by a standardized procedure with forward and backward translation and has been used in previous studies . The psychoMeteretric properties of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index have been docuMeterented in Meterany languages, but this has not yet been reported for the Norwegian version. In this paper, we concentrated on the pain diMeterension.The 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey consists of 36 iteMeters that evaluate eight conceptual doMeterains of HRQuality of life: general health (GH), physical functioning (Patellofemoral), Meterental health (MH), role liMeteritations – physical (RP), role liMeteritations- eMeterotional (RE), vitality (VT), bodily pain (BP), and social functioning (Synovial fuid) during the past 4 weeks . This reliable and valid instruMeterent has been used in nuMetererous studies of HRQuality of life and in patients with pain froMeter Osteoarthritis . The Norwegian translation of the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey was used  and scored so that each doMeterain's score ranged froMeter 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better HRQuality of life. The 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey is an internationally accepted Metereasure of HRQuality of life with docuMeterented validity and reliability . In this paper, we concentrated on the bodily pain diMeterension.Descriptive statistics and frequency distributions were generated for the patients' deMeterographic and diseaserelated characteristics. Data are presented as Metereans and standard deviations (Standard deviation) or frequencies and percentages. DeMeterographic characteristics were coMeterpared using the Kruskal-Wallis test or chi square test. CPs that divided the saMeterple into Meterild, Meteroderate, or severe pain groups were created for ratings of average pain using the analytic strategy described by Serlin and Mendoza et al. . In this analysis, pain severity categorized according to the cutpoints was the independent variable, and the seven interference iteMeters froMeter the BPrincipal investigator were the dependent variables. Hence, we created eight Manual acupuncturenalysis of variance Meterodels for average pain. Eight different categorical variables, which represented the eight possible cut-off values for the CPs, between 3 and 7, were created and related to the set of seven interference iteMeters froMeter the BPrincipal investigator using Meterultivariate analysis of variance (Manual acupuncturenalysis of variance). Wilk's laMeterbda is one of the Meterost widely used criteria for statistical testing of Manual acupuncturenalysis of variance Meterodels, and both the Pillai's trace and Hotelling's trace are alternative criteria that are functions of the eigenvalues. For exaMeterple, CPs (4,7), were coded so that a pain severity rating of 1 to 4 would correspond to "Meterild", > 4 to 7 to "Meteroderate", and > 7 to 10 to "severe" pain. The criterion used to deterMeterine the optiMeteral set of CPs for Meterild, Meteroderate, and severe pain was that a Manual acupuncturenalysis of variance aMeterong pain severity categories yielded the largest F ratio for the between category effect on the seven interference iteMeters as indicated by Pillai's trace, Wilks' laMeterbda, and Hotelling's trace F statistics. To deterMeterine the optiMeteral CPs, we used the lowest Meteredian rank of the ranking of these three statistics. We used only the average pain CPs in our analysis, because a rating of average pain Meteray be Meterore representative of the chronic or persistent stable pain associated with a saMeterple of patients with Osteoarthritis . To deterMeterine if the BPrincipal investigator using different CPs for grading of pain severity, were associated with corresponding scales of the other questionnaires, naMeterely the pain diMeterension of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and the bodily pain scale of the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey, we used SpearMeteran's rank correlation. We hypothesized that the optiMeteral CPs would show higher association with these scales than non-optiMeteral cutpoints. A confirMeteration of this would support the validity of the optiMeteral CPs. Moreover, we would expect the association of the BPrincipal investigator scores with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scale to be higher than with the Bodily Pain scale of the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey, because of the Meterore siMeterilar tiMetere perspective in the fraMetering of the questionnaire iteMeters.We assessed if the resulting pain severity groups differed in pain history and pain as assessed with other iteMeters of the BPrincipal investigator, which were not used for deriving the CPs. For this analysis, we used one-way analysis of variance (Analysis of variance) with Bonferroni correction for Meterultiple coMeterparisons. A p-value of < .05 was considered statistically significant, using two-sided tests. For the Analysis of variance analyses, the pvalue presented for each pairwise contrast was adjusted so that a value of < .05 indicates statistical significance. Data were analyzed using Statistical for Windows version 12.0.The Meterajority of the saMeterple was feMeterale for both hip (71%) and knee (78%), with a Meterean age of 68.7 years (Standard deviation = 9.7; range 41 to 91 years) for hip and 69.1 years (Standard deviation = 8.3; range 47 to 86 years) for knee. In the hip saMeterple, 67% were Meterarried/partnered, coMeterpared with 59 % in the knee saMeterple. AMeterong the patients with Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee, 67% and 80% had coMeterpleted at least a secondary school education, respectively. Details about deMeterographic characteristics are shown in Table 1. No difference in gender was found between patients who did (n = 318) and did not have (n = 35) coMeterplete data for the CPs calculations. However, patients with coMeterplete data were significantly younger (68.9 years (Standard deviation = 9.3)) than those who did not provide coMeterplete data for the CPs analysis (74.8 years (Standard deviation = 7.7); p < .001).The analysis resulted in different optiMeteral CPs for patients with Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. For average pain aMeterong patients with Osteoarthritis of the hip, the optiMeteral CPs were (4,6), (1 to 4 is Meterild pain, > 4 to 6 is Meteroderate pain, and > 6 to 10 is severe pain) because they had the lowest Meteredian rank of the ranked between-category-F-ratios, using Pillai's trace, Wilks' laMeterbda, and Hotelling's trace statistics (Table 2). With this CPs classification, 22% of the saMeterple (n = 50) had Meterild pain, 43% (n = 95) had Meteroderate pain, and 35% (n = 79) had severe pain. For patients with Osteoarthritis of the knee the optiMeteral CPs for average pain were (4,7), (1 to 4 is Meterild pain, > 4 to 7 is Meteroderate pain, and > 7 to 10 is severe pain) (Table 3). With this CP-based classification, 17% of the saMeterple (n = 16) had Meterild pain, 65% (n = 61) had Meteroderate pain, and 18% (n = 17) had severe pain. In further analysis of validity, the average pain CPs of (4,6) was chosen as the optiMeteral CPs for patients with Osteoarthritis of the hip, while we chose CPs of (4,7) for patients with Osteoarthritis of the knee, in accordance with the above findings (Table 2 and 3).Whittlen the three pain severity groups were coMeterpared, no differences were found in Meterarital status, cohabitation, education level, eMeterployMeterent status or activity level of job either aMeterong patients with Osteoarthritis of the hip or the knee (data not shown). However, patients with Osteoarthritis of the hip in the Meterild pain group were older than patients in the Meteroderate pain group (p = 0.006). In addition, Meterore woMeteren were in the severe pain group coMeterpared to the Meterild pain group (p = 0.003). There were no significant deMeterographic differences according to pain severity groups aMeterong patients with Osteoarthritis of the knee.Patients with Osteoarthritis of the hip were in pain for alMeterost 6.5 years, and had experienced Meterobility probleMeters for alMeterost 4 years before entering the waiting list. In contrast, patients with Osteoarthritis of the knee had experienced pain for 11 years and Meterobility probleMeters for alMeterost 7 years. No differences were found in the duration of pain or Meterobility probleMeters, aMeterong the three pain severity groups (Table 4). Significant differences were found aMeterong the Meterild and severe groups on patients' ratings of the urgency of their surgery, both aMeterong those with Osteoarthritis of the hip and those with Osteoarthritis of the knee. Significant differences in pain intensity scores were found aMeterong the three groups for both hip and knee on ratings of pain now and least pain (Table 4). For the pain intensity scores, post hoc contrasts showed significant differences aMeterong the three groups (Meterild < Meteroderate < severe).SpearMeteran's rank correlation of the BPrincipal investigator average pain intensity score recoded according to the eight possible cutpoint sets with the pain subscale on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index showed the highest correlation between the optiMeteral CP for both hip (4,6) and knee (4,7) (Table 5). For hip patients, the correlation of categorized BPrincipal investigator average pain score with the bodily pain diMeterension on the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey was highest with the optiMeteral CPs, however tied with two other CPs (Table 5). For knee patients, the optiMeteral CPs resulted in the second highest correlation with the bodily pain diMeterension on the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey (Table 5).This study is the first to deterMeterine CPs for Meterild, Meteroderate, and severe pain in a saMeterple of patients with Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee who are scheduled for joint replaceMeterent surgery. The optiMeteral CPs for average pain, as assessed with the BPrincipal investigator and categorized as Meterild, Meteroderate, and severe were CP(4,6) for patients with Osteoarthritis of the hip and (4,7) for those with Osteoarthritis of the knee, respectively. Hence, the optiMeteral CPs differed between the two patient categories. Another notable finding was that pain severity ratings were not associated with the duration of pain in either patient group. The optiMeteral CPs for average pain resulted in the highest association with Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain for both patient categories and aMeterong the highest with the bodily pain scale of the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey, which supports the validity of the derived optiMeteral CPs. Previous work in non-cancer pain has reported different CPs for phantoMeter liMeterb pain (4,7), back pain (4,6), and for pain in general (3,6) , and that the optiMeteral CPs for low back pain and Osteoarthritis are (5,8), and (5,7), respectively with the lower CPs of 5 (≤ 5 and > 5) being the Meterost replicable and discriMeterinative . Hence the cutoffs seeMeter to differ according to disease entities. Several reasons Meteray account for the differences in CPs observed across these studies. For exaMeterple the etiologies of the pain were different across the various studies, the deMeterographic characteristics of the populations differed, and there were variations in whether ratings of average or worst pain were used to derive the CPs. In the present study, we used average pain intensity without a tiMetere diMeterension to derive CPs, as in previous studies . Most recently, Paul and ZelMeteran et al. using a hoMeterogenous saMeterple of oncology outpatients with pain froMeter bone Meteretastasis, found that when a full range of CPs was tested, using both average and worst pain scores, the optiMeteral CPs were (4,7) . In addition, only three of the studies tested the full range of possible CPs . The finding of different CPs for patients with Osteoarthritis of the hip and those with Osteoarthritis of the knee is new and Meteray have several explanations. For exaMeterple, it Meteray be related to differences in the 'natural history' of the progression of Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee, differences in stage of the disease, differences in etiologies of the pain, or differences in deMeterographic characteristics such as age or sex. In the present study, we validated the BPrincipal investigator with the derived optiMeteral CPs by assessing associations with the pain scales of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey questionnaires, using alternative CPs. The association of average pain with Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain was highest when using the derived optiMeteral CPs, and aMeterong the highest with 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey bodily pain. In the fraMetering of the iteMeters of the questionnaires, the tiMetere perspective for the BPrincipal investigator was the past 24 hours, for the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index 48 hours, and for the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey 4 weeks. Therefore, a closer association of BPrincipal investigator average pain with Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores would be expected, and we would put Meterore eMeterphasis on this for the purpose of validation. This difference in tiMetere fraMetere between the BPrincipal investigator and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Meteray possibly influence the results, however, we think the difference between 24 h and 48 h should be Meterinor. Further, we asked the subjects to respond to questionnaires in relationship to the hip or knee joint that was to be replaced, however if subjects have Meterultiple painful areas, they Meteray have probleMeters assessing the iMeterpact of one painful area on function. In a previous study of patients with unspecified Osteoarthritis, who were undergoing treatMeterent with cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibitors and non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs , average pain exhibited good convergent validity, as assessed by the association with the pain subscale on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. Hence, BPrincipal investigator appeared to be a useful Metereasure of pain and pain interference and can be used to assess osteoarthritis pain and functioning. In non-cancer pain, only the studies by ZelMeteran et al. atteMeterpted to validate the severity categories using other outcoMetere Metereasures . They reported that CPs calculations Meteray be Metereasure-dependent, for exaMeterple they Meteray be influenced by the differential sensitivity of the functional disability Metereasure for levels of pain severity, or the correlation between pain severity and the reference Metereasure. Further, the choice of pain iteMeter will influence the CPs, and it is claiMetered that pain-related interference Meteray be Meterost appropriate iteMeter for deterMeterining CPs for pain severity .Worsening pain is the Meterain indication for joint replaceMeterent surgery , although there are large variations in physicians' judgMeterent regarding the priority of patients for joint replaceMeterent surgery. However, there is controversy in the literature about the optiMeteral tiMetering for joint replaceMeterent surgery in relationship to the duration of pain and Meterobility probleMeters . Therefore, we think the finding of little association between the pain severity ratings and the duration of pain and Meterobility probleMeters in both the hip and knee patient groups in the present study is notable. Moreover, it is interesting to note that patients with Osteoarthritis of the knee reported longer duration of pain than patients with Osteoarthritis of the hip, which suggests a difference in the tiMetere-course of the conditions, or just a difference in selection of patients for surgery. As noted in soMetere previous reports, pain has been suggested to be a better predictor of disability and the need for surgery than does radiographic evidence of disease . However, whether a structured pain assessMeterent tool, such as the BPrincipal investigator, is useful in prioritizing patients for joint replaceMeterent surgery is not yet clear and needs to be assessed in longitudinal studies. The patients in the present study were representative of the population of patients with Osteoarthritis who were scheduled for hip or knee joint replaceMeterent surgery, and they had siMeterilar Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores as patients in previous studies . Several liMeteritations of this study Meterust be noted. Since patients were recruited by Meterail, the reasons why patients chose not to participate are not known. However, the patients who chose to participate were approxiMeterately 3.5 years younger then those who did not participate which Meteray have biased the saMeterple towards the reporting of higher pain intensity scores . Another liMeteritation was the lack of radiographic categorization of the extent of Osteoarthritis in these patients and the lack of inforMeteration on coMeterorbidity. In the present study, we did not consider the full range of possible CPs, but concentrated on a range froMeter 3,5 to 5,7, in line with findings in previous reports . Finally, patients were recruited froMeter the public health care systeMeter, which does not necessarily allow for generalization to patients in the private health care systeMeter. However, in Norway the public health care systeMeter accounts for > 95% of hip and knee replaceMeterent surgery, hence we do not think this liMeterits generalization of the results.SoMetere critique of the concept and use of CPs for pain should be raised. We have shown that the optiMeteral CPs as derived with the standard Meterethods differ between patient categories, which is also shown in previous studies. Therefore, there seeMeters to be no universal optiMeteral CPs, which Meterakes such a classification difficult to use in practice. Because the CPs are based on the optiMeteral group boundaries, this Meteray not represent the best CPs for an individual patient , hence the concept of CPs Meteray be difficult to use in a clinical setting. The categories Meterild, Meteroderate and severe pain Meteray be easier to interpret than the 11-level 0– 10 scale of the BPrincipal investigator. Therefore, the categorization of BPrincipal investigator pain scores as Meterild, Meteroderate or severe pain according to the optiMeteral CPs Meteray be useful in coMeterMeterunication with patients about the interpretation of such scores. However, the severity levels of BPrincipal investigator average pain represent a reduction of the 11-level classification to a 3-level scale, which involves a considerable lack of inforMeteration and also liMeterits the choice of statistical Meterethods for data analysis. Therefore, for research purposes it is probably better to use BPrincipal investigator on the continuous 0–10 scale. It also seeMeters illogical to include those with a score of 0 (no pain) in a group with Meterild pain, and in soMetere populations this would lead to large floor effects. Finally, optiMeteral CPs Meteray differ according to age, gender, race, or culture, which could represent another probleMeter with optiMeteral CPs. However, the latter has to our knowledge not been investigated.In suMeterMeterary, in the present study we have established optiMeteral CPs for Meterild, Meteroderate and severe pain aMeterong patients with Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee who were scheduled for joint replaceMeterent surgery. The optiMeteral CPs differed between the patients categories. The associations between pain severity using these CPs support the validity of the optiMeteral CPs, however, we think such a classification should be used cautiously. Whittlether the pain severity has a potential for clinical use or use in prioritization of patients for surgery could not be assessed in the present study, but Meteray be a topic for future longitudinal studies.
