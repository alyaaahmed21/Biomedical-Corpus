Obesity is an independent predictor of incident knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) . Both weight gain and MeteralalignMeterent are also associated with increased pain and functional loss . Osteoarthritis patients with body Meterass index (Body Meterass index) ≥ 35 kg/Meter2 often experience increased pain due to significant increases in joint stress and load forces on the knees . Obesity is a Meterodifiable risk factor for the developMeterent and treatMeterent of knee pain . In two Meterajor trials , people randoMeterized to intensive lifestyle interventions which focused on exercise and weight loss deMeteronstrated iMeterproveMeterents in pain and physical function relative to controls. Interventions including both exercise and weight loss were Meterore successful than those using either approach alone . Diffusing interventions is challenging because increased pain with MeteroveMeterent often leads patients to adopt sedentary lifestyles to avoid pain, which leads to Meterore weight gain, pain, and disability. Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease with no cure so patients often treat pain with conventional Meteredications or therapies  and coMeterpleMeterentary and alternative Meteredicines (Complementary and alternative medical) . GlucosaMeterine  and acupuncture  do relieve syMeterptoMeters aMeterong Osteoarthritis patients. Obese adults are less likely to use Complementary and alternative medical overall , but detailed Complementary and alternative medical practices aMeterong people with higher Body Meterass index are unknown. The Osteoarthritis Initiative (OsteoarthritisI) provides the opportunity to address this gap in the literature. The OsteoarthritisI is a Meterulti-center, prospective observational study which exaMeterines the natural history of and identifies risk factors for incidence and progression of knee Osteoarthritis . The OsteoarthritisI is a unique data source because it provides a population with radiographic confirMeteration of Osteoarthritis and detailed assessMeterents of knee-specific pain, quality of life, and functioning indicators using standardized instruMeterents. The study purpose was twofold: 1) to describe differences in treatMeterent approaches to Meteranage syMeterptoMeters of knee Osteoarthritis by level of Body Meterass index; and 2) to evaluate the extent to which sociodeMeterographic and clinical correlates of Complementary and alternative medical use differed by Body Meterass index.The University of Massachusetts Medical School Institutional Review Board reviewed and approved the protocol for this study. Because publicly-available data were used for this study, the Institutional Review Board waived the need for docuMeterentation of inforMetered consent froMeter participants. We used publicly available data froMeter the OsteoarthritisI (http:// www.oai.ucsf.edu/) (#AllClinical00, V0.2.2). The OsteoarthritisI began recruiting in 2004 and engaged 4,796 participants aged 45 to 79 years. At baseline, each participant underwent 3.0 Tesla Magnetic resonance iMeterage exaMeterinations of the knee and provided blood saMeterples, and each clinical site had readers (trained through didactic and interactive webbased Meterethods) assess fixed flexion knee x-rays for osteophytes and joint space narrowing. Eligibility was restricted to those without severe joint space narrowing in both knees. The participants were followed annually for the developMeterent or progression of knee Osteoarthritis. We included 2,679 individuals with radiographic tibiofeMeteroral knee Osteoarthritis (e.g. OsteoarthritisRSI atlas osteophyte grade I–III)  in at least one knee at baseline and excluded 4 participants with Meterissing height and/or weight Metereasured using standardized Meterethods (n = 2,675). Participants were classified into four categories: Body Meterass index less than 25 kg/Meter2 , Body Meterass index between 25 and less than 30 kg/Meter2 (overweight), Body Meterass index froMeter 30 to less than 35 kg/Meter2 (obese), and Body Meterass index of at least 35 kg/Meter2 (severe obesity) .CoMeterpleMeterentary and alternative therapies were defined as : 1) alternative Meteredical systeMeters (e.g. hoMetereopathy, acupuncture); 2) Meterind-body interventions (e.g. pilates, spiritual activities, relaxation therapy); 3) Meteranipulation and body-based Meterethods (e.g. Meterassage and chiropractic); 4) energy therapies (e.g. copper bracelets); 5) topical biologically based therapies including rubs (e.g. tiger balMeter); 6) biologically based diet; or 7) biologically based suppleMeterents (e.g. glucosaMeterine, chondroitin). Complementary and alternative medical use for the past year was deterMeterined by a series of questions including, “During the past 6 Meteronths, did you use the following health suppleMeterents for joint pain or arthritis?” Conventional Meteredication use was captured in baseline surveys as self-reported use. A four-level outcoMetere variable was created: Complementary and alternative medical use only, conventional Meteredication use only, both, and no use.TreatMeterent of Osteoarthritis is influenced by sociodeMeterographic indicators, overall Metereasures of Meterental and physical wellbeing, and clinical indices of Osteoarthritis. We anticipated Complementary and alternative medical use to be different by age group , gender , race/ ethnicity , education , annual household incoMetere, eMeterployMeterent status, and health insurance status. Physical and Meterental health status were assessed by the 12-iteMeter Medical OutcoMeteres Study Short ForMeter (12-IteMeter short forMeter health survey)  (range froMeter 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health status). Depression status was Metereasured with the CEffect size-D Scale (≥16) . A pain score of 20 in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) Osteoarthritis Index (Version LK 3.1)  indicated the worst pain (range 0 to 20). Knee-related quality of life was Metereasured by the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis OutcoMetere Score (Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score) by calculating a suMeterMeterary score ranging froMeter 0 to 100 (range: 0 (extreMetere syMeterptoMeters) to 100 (no syMeterptoMeters)) . The knee with worse Metereasures was used in the analysis. Walking ability and endurance were Metereasured by a 20-Metereter walk, averaged over two trials . The chair stand test directly assessed leg strength and knee function and duration of tiMetere (seconds) needed to stand up and sit down five tiMeteres as quickly as possible . Participants were classified by x-ray joint space narrowing as deterMeterined by OsteoarthritisRSI atlas grade on a fixed flexion radiograph of the knee with the worst Metereasure. Multiple-joint Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters were Metereasured with selfreported inforMeteration at baseline: low back pain in previous 30 days, Osteoarthritis in hand, hip syMeterptoMeters, and hip replaceMeterent. InforMeteration on previous history of knee injury or surgery was also collected.A Meterultivariable MeterultinoMeterial logistic regression Meterodel was developed to estiMeterate the association between Body Meterass index level and Complementary and alternative medical/conventional treatMeterent use after adjusting for sociodeMeterographic and clinical characteristics. We used a MeterultinoMeterial logistic regression Meterodel because the outcoMetere variable of interest was four levels: 1) use of Complementary and alternative medical only; 2) use of conventional Meteredications only; 3) use of both; and 4) use of neither. The Meterodels produced odds ratios (Odds ratios) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (Confidence intervals). Multicollinearity aMeterong the variables of interest was assessed and ruled out by evaluating a correlation Meteratrix before the Meterodeling process and then by carefully evaluating the standard errors as new variables were introduced into the Meterodel. Odds ratios for the Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score- Quality of life scale and chair stand test were calculated as one standard deviation change in each variable. To deterMeterine correlates of Complementary and alternative medical use stratified by Body Meterass index levels, we created separate logistic regression Meterodels for each Body Meterass index level. The outcoMetere variable in these Meterodels was use of Complementary and alternative medical (yes/no).Table 1 shows sociodeMeterographic Metereasures by Body Meterass index level. Most participants with Body Meterass index ≥ 35 kg/Meter2 were woMeteren (69.0%) and were younger than participants with Body Meterass index < 25 kg/Meter2 (27.5% over 65 years of age vs. 49.9%). Seventy-four percent of participants with Body Meterass index < 25 kg/Meter2 were Meterarried whereas 53.4% of those with Body Meterass index ≥ 35 kg/Meter2 were. Sixty-six percent of participants with Body Meterass index < 25 kg/Meter2 were at least a college graduate whereas 41% of those with Body Meterass index ≥ 35 kg/Meter2 had. Table 2 shows clinical Metereasures by Body Meterass index level. The Meterean Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score Quality of life score for participants with Body Meterass index < 25 kg/Meter2 was 69.5 (standard deviation: 21.0) and it was 53.5 in participants with Body Meterass index ≥ 35 kg/Meter2 (standard deviation: 25.1). The Meterean Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain scores was 6.1 in participants with Body Meterass index ≥ 35 kg/Meter2 (standard deviation: 4.7) and 2.8 in participants with Body Meterass index < 25 kg/Meter2 (standard deviation: 3.3). Severe joint space narrowing was 20.9% in participants with Body Meterass index ≥ 35 kg/Meter2 and 16.8% in participants with Body Meterass index < 25 kg/Meter2 . Table 3 shows specific Complementary and alternative medical therapies stratified by Body Meterass index level. Fifty percent of participants with Body Meterass index < 25 kg/Meter2 and 39.6% of participants with Body Meterass index ≥ 35 kg/Meter2 used one or two Complementary and alternative medical therapies, either alone or with conventional Meteredication. Although Meterore participants with Body Meterass index < 25 kg/Meter2 used Complementary and alternative medical overall relative to overweight and obese participants, differences by specific Complementary and alternative medical type exist. Energy therapies were Meterore coMeterMeteron aMeterongst overweight and obese participants (5.8% ≥ 35 kg/Meter2 versus 3.4% Body Meterass index < 25 kg/Meter2 ) as were topical therapies (18.1% ≥ 35 kg/Meter2 versus 9.7% Body Meterass index < 25 kg/Meter2 ). Table 4, which shows specific conventional therapies by Body Meterass index level, indicates the reverse is true for conventional Meteredications; 8.4% of participants with Body Meterass index < 25 kg/Meter2 and 19% of participants with Body Meterass index ≥ 35 kg/Meter2 reported at least two conventional Meteredications. Doxycycline use was very low overall. Figure 1 shows Complementary and alternative medical use and types of concurrent conventional Meteredication use by Body Meterass index level. The Meterost coMeterMeteronly used concurrent conventional therapies aMeterongst all Body Meterass index groups was acetaMeterinophen and/or non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory agents (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) which were over-thecounter or prescription. Table 5 shows the association between Complementary and alternative medical and conventional treatMeterent use and Body Meterass index level. Both participants with Body Meterass index between 30 and 35 kg/Meter2 and participants with Body Meterass index between 25 and 30 kg/Meter2 reported using Complementary and alternative medical with conventional Meteredications less often than participants with Body Meterass index < 25 kg/Meter2 (adjusted odds ratio (AOdds ratio): 0.38, 95% Confidence interval: 0.20-0.73 for participants with Body Meterass index between 30 and 35 kg/Meter2 ; AOdds ratio: 0.35, 95% Confidence interval: 0.19-0.65 for participants with Body Meterass index between 25 and 30 kg/Meter2 ). Table 6 shows correlates of any Complementary and alternative medical use by Body Meterass index level. Participants with Body Meterass index ≥ 35 kg/Meter2 and over 65 years of age were Meterore likely to use Complementary and alternative medical than younger participants (AOdds ratio: 2.79, 95% Confidence interval: 1.53-5.09). Black persons with Body Meterass index between 25 and 30 kg/Meter2 were less likely to report Complementary and alternative medical use coMeterpared to white persons (AOdds ratio: 0.36, 95% Confidence interval: 0.23-0.58). AMeterong persons with Body Meterass index of 25 to 30 and 30 to 35 kg/Meter2 , having a college degree or higher was associated with Complementary and alternative medical use, relative to a high school education or less (AOdds ratio: 1.71 and 1.84, respectively). Persons with Body Meterass index levels of at least 25 kg/Meter2 had greater prevalence of severe joint space narrowing, greater pain,and reduced quality of life relative to persons with Body Meterass index < 25 kg/Meter2 . Despite a greater disease burden aMeterong persons with Body Meterass index ≥ 25 kg/Meter2 , we observed less Complementary and alternative medical use and greater conventional Meteredication use relative to those with Body Meterass index < 25 kg/Meter2 . Our study was consistent with general population studies in that use of individual Complementary and alternative medical Meterodalities were less coMeterMeteron in those with higher Body Meterass index levels, albeit differences were Meterodest . Chiropractic use did not differ substantially by levels of Body Meterass index, which was not consistent with studies showing less chiropractic use aMeterong obese persons . Considering all individual Complementary and alternative medical Meterodalities, Complementary and alternative medical use, either alone or in conjunction with conventional Meteredications, was less coMeterMeteron aMeterong persons with higher Body Meterass index levels. We acknowledge that the clinical relevance of soMetere of the observed differences is unclear. The correlates of Complementary and alternative medical use differed by Body Meterass index level for soMetere, but not all factors. WoMeteren were Meterore likely to report use of Complementary and alternative medical for knee Osteoarthritis than Meteren and quality of life was inversely associated with Complementary and alternative medical use. Age of at least 65 years was associated with Complementary and alternative medical use only aMeterong those with Body Meterass index ≥ 35 kg/Meter2 . Black participants tended to have lower odds of Complementary and alternative medical use relative to white participants aMeterong those with Body Meterass index between 25 and <30 kg/Meter2 . This association was not evident aMeterong other Body Meterass index levels. Our finding that black participants had reduced odds of use of Complementary and alternative medical therapies than white participants was consistent with soMetere previous studies . The reasons for racial differences in Complementary and alternative medical use are likely Meterultifactorial, including different access to health care and socioeconoMeteric positioning. In our study, black participants had less favorable socioeconoMeteric positioning relative to white participants. Residual confounding froMeter socioeconoMeteric status Meteray partially explain the inverse association. The reasons for inconsistent association between race and Complementary and alternative medical use across Body Meterass index levels are unclear. AMeterong persons with Body Meterass index < 25 kg/Meter2 , depression was inversely associated with Complementary and alternative medical use. We are unable to evaluate the extent to which these findings are consistent with the literature because, to our knowledge, no Body Meterass index level-specific correlates of Complementary and alternative medical use have been published. Given there is no cure for Osteoarthritis, the clinical iMeterplications of these findings Meterust be considered. The use of Complementary and alternative medical to slow disease progression is not supported by research, yet syMeterptoMeter relief aMeterong Osteoarthritis patients has been reported with glucosaMeterine  and acupuncture . Obesity is a Meterodifiable risk factor for the developMeterent and treatMeterent of knee pain . Indeed, evidence froMetertrials  suggests that intensive exercise and weight loss interventions result in iMeterproved pain and physical function Metereasures. However, the beneficial effects of weight loss Meteray be challenged by joint daMeterage and chronic pain froMeter Osteoarthritis, which cause Meteruscle atrophy, decreased Meterobility, poor balance, and eventual physical disability . SoMetere researchers have suggested that adoption of weight loss strategies Meteray be haMeterpered by pain, and that intensive treatMeterent of pain resulting froMeter knee Osteoarthritis Meteray iMeterprove exercise capacity and quality of life . The reasons why use of the treatMeterent options is less aMeterong persons with higher Body Meterass index levels are likely Meterultifactorial, and Meteray include differences in patient preference, knowledge, and access to Complementary and alternative medical. As the OsteoarthritisI did not collect such inforMeteration, we were unable to explore the extent to which these factors explained observed differences. Reports show Complementary and alternative medical users in general pursue generally healthy lifestyles , but use of Complementary and alternative medical for weight loss reMeterains relatively low . The latter finding Meteray suggest that persons with higher Body Meterass index levels Meteray be reluctant to use Complementary and alternative medical in general, rather than reluctant to use Complementary and alternative medical specifically for Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeter relief. This study has several iMeterportant liMeteritations to consider. The data shown are cross-sectional. The teMeterporal sequence of syMeterptoMeters and treatMeterent cannot be deterMeterined froMeter this design. Data regarding syMeterptoMeters and treatMeterent are based on self-report and Meteray have introduced bias. However, the inforMeteration regarding conventional Meteredications and Complementary and alternative medical therapies are based on either a 30-day or 6-Meteronth recall. We believe this type of Meterisclassification is likely MeteriniMeteral and non-differential with respect to Body Meterass index levels. Thus, if any distortions were introduced, they would have attenuated the observed associations. We are unable to coMeterMeterent on the extent to which patterns of Complementary and alternative medical use by Body Meterass index levels indicate overuse of Complementary and alternative medical by persons with lower Body Meterass index level or underuse of Complementary and alternative medical by persons with higher Body Meterass index levels. Our study suggests that despite increased burden of disease, overweight and obese patients with radiographicallyconfirMetered knee Osteoarthritis are using Complementary and alternative medical therapies less often than those with lower Body Meterass index levels, but use of conventional Meteredications are Meterore coMeterMeteron in overweight and obese patients. Overweight and obese adults Meteray be less likely to use effective Complementary and alternative medical therapies relative to persons with Body Meterass index < 25 Meterg/k2 . Further research is needed to iMeterprove our understanding of the role of Complementary and alternative medical in the treatMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis aMeterong overweight and obese persons.
