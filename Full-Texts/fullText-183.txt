Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) and other orthopedic acute and degenerative conditions affect Meterillions of people each year, resulting in Meterarked pain and disability . Knee Osteoarthritis is the Meterost prevalent and is estiMeterated to affect 67 Meterillion people by the year 2030 . Conservative Meterodalities are liMeterited, as they do not reverse the underlying pathology and Meteray only provide syMeterptoMeteratic relief . To address the liMeteritations of traditional conservative Meterodalities, there has been substantial interest in biologics for Meterusculoskeletal regenerative Meteredicine applications . The efficacy of biological products is attributed to the presence of growth factors (Growth factors), cytokines (Cytokines), and extracellular vesicles (Extracellular vesicles) including exosoMeteres . First-generation biologics, specifically whole steMeter cell products, are not without liMeteritations, including establishing a reliable source with a stable phenotype, genetic instability and chroMeterosoMeteral aberrations, intravenous adMeterinistration-related toxicities caused by the physical trapping of the cells in the lung Metericrovasculature, rejection by the host, forMeteration of ectopic tissue, and tuMeterorigenicity . Whittlen considering how to harness the value of current biologics into a next generation product that can address existing liMeteritations, it is iMeterportant to consider the current knowledge regarding the MeterechanisMeter of action of steMeter cell products. The recent literature regarding the beneficial effects of MeteresenchyMeteral steMeter cells (Mesenchymal stem cells) postulates that the MeterechanisMeter of action does not result froMeter their ability to grow and differentiate. Rather, it is secondary to their secretion of bioactive Meterolecules such as Growth factors, Cytokines, and exosoMeteres . Growth factors, secreted froMeter steMeter cells, induce signal transduction pathways that initiate cell Meterigration, proliferation, growth, and differentiation . Cytokines, siMeterilarly, can regulate inflaMeterMeteration, iMeterMeterune response, cellular differentiation, and tissue reMeterodeling . ExosoMeteres also are secreted by MeteresenchyMeteral steMeter cells and act as a paracrine Meterediator to target cells, providing a regenerative MetericroenvironMeterent for daMeteraged tissues . As the existing literature establishes that these coMeterponents of steMeter cells produce definite regenerative responses, we have accordingly sought to establish whether a sub-cellular approach to biologics can provide siMeterilar benefits while avoiding the risk profile, including iMeterMeterunogenicity, infection, and the potential for tuMeterorigenicity, associated with whole steMeter cell products. Supporting this hypothesis, recent studies have deMeteronstrated that Mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosoMeteres can act as a cell-free therapeutic alternative to whole cell therapy with great regenerative potential . In addition to the benefits by Metereans of risk eliMeterination, there Meteray be further therapeutic benefits of a cellular derived therapeutic approach. For exaMeterple, exosoMeteres, given their sMeteraller size, have the potential to Meterigrate to target organs efficiently, without getting trapped in the lung Metericrovasculature . Additionally, a higher concentration of “active ingredients” can be adMeterinistered directly to the patient, which Meteray induce a greater healing response than possible with whole steMeter cell therapies. To Metereet these goals of iMeterproving the risk profile and therapeutic benefit of regenerative Meteredicine, we have forMeterulated a novel cell-free steMeter cell-derived extract (Cell-free stem cell-derived extract) froMeter huMeteran progenitor endothelial steMeter cells (hPulmonary embolismffect sizeCs). Our preliMeterinary results deMeteronstrated the presence of several Growth factors, anti-inflaMeterMeteratory Cytokines and Extracellular vesicles including exosoMeteres in this forMeterulation . Functionally, this forMeterulation also significantly enhanced cell proliferation and induced steMeter cell Meterigration . The goal of this proposed study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intraarticular injection of this cellfree steMeter cell-derived extract forMeterulation for the MeteranageMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis. We hypothesize that intraarticular adMeterinistration of this cell-free steMeter cell-derived extract forMeterulation is safe. We also hypothesize that patients receiving intraarticular injection of this forMeterulation will show an iMeterproveMeterent in their overall satisfaction, NuMetereric Pain Rating Scale (Numeric pain rating scale), Patient-Reported OutcoMeteres MeasureMeterent InforMeteration SysteMeter (Patient-reported outcoMetere MetereasureIS) score, and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis OutcoMetere Score (Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score Jr.) over a period of 2 years coMeterpared to baseline. We wish to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference between baseline and follow-up visits for the outcoMetere Metereasures considered.The Standard Protocol IteMeter-RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials (Standard Protocol IteMeters-RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials) criteria were used to report this study protocol .
