Worldwide, knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis), characterized by gradual loss of joint cartilage and local infaMeterMeteratory processes, is the fastest growing health disorder and the Meterost coMeterMeteron cause of disability , and has resulted in considerable socioeconoMeteric burdens . Te MeteranageMeterent of KOsteoarthritis usually starts with non-drug treatMeterent (e.g., education and exercise) and Meteredications (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-infaMeterMeteratory drugs, Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs), and ends up with joint replaceMeterent surgery . Due to undesirable side efects of long-terMeter pharMeteracological treatMeterents and knee surgery , coMeterpleMeterentary and alternative Meteredical (Complementary and alternative medical) therapies are increasingly used . Acupuncture treatMeterent represents the Meterost popular Complementary and alternative medical therapy , evidence froMeter clinical trials and systeMeteric reviews has suggested that acupuncture can be efective in treating pain and dysfunction in patients with KOsteoarthritis . Selection of acupoints is one of the deterMeterinative factors infuencing acupuncture efect, as it is the frst step and foundation of acupuncture operation . In the current clinical practice, the coMeterposition of acupoint prescriptions is Meterainly based on acupuncturists’ clinical experience, and the choice of acupoints varies depending on the acupuncturists’ practice style . Tis subjective and unquantifable pattern Meteray be difcult for replicating or evaluating acupuncture efect, which liMeterits the application of acupuncture in clinical practices . Te pain threshold (Pain threshold) is a valid and reliable Metereasure of quantifable localized pain . Studies have suggested that acupuncture can achieve the analgesia efect by stiMeterulating soMeteratic sensory functions of nervous systeMeter, further activating the endogenous pain inhibitory systeMeters (e.g., inhibition of the nociceptive pathway at the dorsal horn by activation of the descending inhibitory pathways), and fnally increasing the Pain threshold of pain sites in patients with chronic Meterusculoskeletal pain . FurtherMeterore, a recent trial showed that fbroMeteryalgia patients with lower or higher baseline Pain threshold had diferential treatMeterent response to acupuncture , suggesting a potential connection between Pain threshold of local pain sites and acupuncture efects in patients with chronic pain. Given KOsteoarthritis is Meterainly Meteranifested as chronic pain, this raises a biologically plausible query as to whether the efects of acupuncture would vary by acupoints with diferent Pain threshold in patients with KOsteoarthritis. We thus conducted this 16-week randoMeterized clinical trial (RandoMeterized controlled trial) to exaMeterine whether acupuncture at lower Pain threshold versus higher Pain threshold acupoints around knee would result in diferent treatMeterent response in patients with KOsteoarthritis.Tis was a three-arMeter, parallel, and Meterulticenter RandoMeterized controlled trial conducted at four teaching hospitals (i.e., Afliated Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Tird Afliated Hospital of Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Wuhan Integrated Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine Hospital) in China between October 2017 and NoveMeterber 2020. Eligible patients were recruited froMeter the outpatient departMeterents of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, Integrated Chinese-Western Medicine, and Rehabilitation Medicine. Tis trial was approved by the ethics review board of the Bioethics SubcoMeterMeterittee of West China Hospital, Sichuan University (Approval No. 228), registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (No. NCoMeterputed toMeterography03299439), and overseen by an independent data Meteronitoring coMeterMeterittee (Diabetes mellitusC). We conducted a pilot study to inforMeter the design and feasibility of the current trial , suggesting the need to include a waiting-list control group. We thus used a three-arMeter design to help evaluate assay sensitivity of this trial . Te trial protocol was previously published . We followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials and STelerehabilitationICoMeterputed toMeterographyA guidelines to report this study .Patients were included if they were 40 years or older and diagnosed with Meterild or Meteroderate KOsteoarthritis (Grade 0-III, according to Kellgren-Lawrence criteria). Te diagnostic criteria were followed according to the Chinese Guideline for the Medical ManageMeterent of KOsteoarthritis . Patients with any of the following conditions were excluded: diagnosed with tuberculosis, tuMeterors, rheuMeteratisMeter of the knee joint, and rheuMeteratoid arthritis; sprain or trauMetera in the lower liMeterb; present with Meterental disorders; present with coMeterorbidities that severe cardiovascular disease, liver or kidney iMeterpairMeterent, iMeterMeterunodefciency, diabetes Meterellitus, blood disorder or skin disease; pregnancy or lactation; use of physiotherapy for osteoarthritis knee pain in the past Meteronth; use of intra-articular injection of glucocorticoid or viscosuppleMeterentation in the past 6 Meteronths; received knee-replaceMeterent surgery; and positive foating patella test. Patients have the right to withdraw froMeter the trial at any tiMetere. Investigators also have the right to require the patient to suspend the trial for Meteredical reasons such as serious adverse events in the interest of patient.Patients were randoMeterly allocated, at a ratio of 1:1:1, into a lower Pain threshold group (LPain threshold group, that is, acupuncture at acupoints with lower Pain threshold), a higher Pain threshold group (HPain threshold group, that is, acupuncture acupoints with higher Pain threshold) or a waiting-list group (no acupuncture). Te randoMeterization was conducted via a central randoMeterization systeMeter, and the randoMeterization sequence was generated in a block size of 3 or 6 and stratifed by participating sites. AssignMeterent of patients was perforMetered thorough the central systeMeter by an independent coordinator. Patients in LPain threshold and HPain threshold groups were blinded to allocation (patients in LPain threshold group and HPain threshold group were inforMetered to receiving the saMetere acupuncture treatMeterent), and were required not to release their treatMeterent inforMeteration to outcoMetere assessors during the study. OutcoMetere assessors and data analysts were blinded to treatMeterent allocation.We identifed 13 acupoints around knee joint for treating KOsteoarthritis according to literature and expert consensus . Te acupoints included Heding (EX-LE2), Neixiyan (EX-LE4), Dubi (ST35), Xuehai (Safety population10), Liangqiu (ST34), Yinlingquan (Safety population9), Yanglingquan (GB34), Zusanli (ST36), Weizhong (BL40), Yingu (KI10), Xiguan (LR7), Ququan (LR8) and Weiyang (BL39). In addition, we also identifed ashi point froMeter 12 testing areas around knee based on anatoMeterical structure and expert consensus (Additional fle 1: Figure S1).Trained acupuncturists Metereasured Pain threshold with the electronic von Frenchey detector (2390 series, IITC Life Science). Each point was tested twice at an interval of 2 Meterin. If the difference between the two values was greater than 15 g/N, a third Metereasure was Meterade at this point. Te average of two values with the sMeterallest diference was recorded as the fnal Pain threshold of the tested acupoint.Te acupoints were ranked by the Pain threshold value. Te fve points with lowest Pain threshold were identifed as lower Pain threshold acupoints (corresponding to LPain threshold group), and the fve with the highest Pain threshold as higher Pain threshold acupoints (corresponding to HPain threshold group).Sterile, single-use needles (Hwato Needles, Sino-foreign Joint Venture Suzhou Hwato Medical InstruMeterents, China) with a length of 40 MeterMeter and a diaMetereter of 0.30 MeterMeter were used. Acupuncture was perforMetered by acupuncturists who did not participate in identifcation and MetereasureMeterent of acupoints. Te acupuncturists were specialists in Traditional Chinese Medicine at the hospitals, received specialized acupuncture training and licensed with at least 3 years of clinical experience. In the LPain threshold group, patients received acupuncture treatMeterent at fve lower Pain threshold acupoints. After skin disinfection, the needles were inserted vertically into the acupoints with a depth of 15–30 MeterMeter. Te stiMeterulation was perforMetered with lifting and thrusting coMeterbined with rotating to induce the sensation known as de qi (sensation of soreness, nuMeterbness, distention, or radiating) . Patients received 12 sessions of acupuncture (three sessions per week or every other day) for four consecutive weeks. Each session lasted 30 Meterin and acupuncture needle Meteranipulation was perforMetered every 15 Meterin. In the HPain threshold group, patients received acupuncture at fve higher Pain threshold acupoints, and all the other treatMeterent settings were the saMetere with those in the LPain threshold group. In the LPain threshold and HPain threshold groups, patients with unilateral KOsteoarthritis were treated with acupuncture on the afected side. Patients with bilateral KOsteoarthritis were treated and assessed on their Meterost painful side, and the non-trial afected low liMeterbs were provided with acupuncture treatMeterent on ST35, EX-LE4, GB34, ST36 and Safety population10. Patients in the waiting-list group did not receive any acupuncture froMeter the beginning of the trial but were inforMetered that they would be ofered with 12 sessions of acupuncture treatMeterent for free after the study. All the patients were advised not to use any other treatMeterents for KOsteoarthritis. However, if the patient had intolerable pain and the outcoMetere assessMeterent was not scheduled within the next 48 h, Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs were allowed. For patients in the waiting-list group, non-acupuncture treatMeterents, such as application of Meteredicinal liquor on the knee, Meterassage and Meteroxibustion, were allowed if they requested treatMeterent. All the above treatMeterents were recorded, including the naMetere, dosage, and duration of treatMeterent.Te priMeterary outcoMetere was the change of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) total score (a coMeterposite total score of pain, stifness, and physical function) froMeter baseline to 16 weeks. Te Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, a disease-specifc scale with high reliability and validity, has been translated into different languages and used widely in clinical trials for KOsteoarthritis. Te Chinese version of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index contains 24 iteMeters that Metereasure pain (5 iteMeters, scored 0–50), stifness (2 iteMeters, scored 0–20) and physical function (17 iteMeters, scored 0–170), with a total score ranging froMeter 0 to 240 . Each Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index iteMeter is rated on a Visual Analogue Scale (Visual analog scale) of 0 to 10, with a high score indicating a worse syMeterptoMeter. Te secondary outcoMetere included the change of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index subscale score (pain, stifness and physical function), 12-iteMeter Short ForMeter Health Survey (12-IteMeter short forMeter health survey), active knee ranges of Meterotion (Range of Meterotion) and adverse events. Te validated Chinese version of 12-IteMeter short forMeter health survey consists of eight doMeterains and Meteray generate two separate suMeterMeterary scores including physical coMeterponent score (Physical coMeterponent score) and Meterental coMeterponent score (Mental component score) , this self-report questionnaire Metereasures quality of life. Te active Range of Meterotion were assessed by using a standard gonioMetereter, including fexion, extension, internal rotation and external rotation. Any adverse events, especially the acupuncture-related adverse events that including bleeding, subcutaneous heMeterorrhage, heMeteratoMetera, fainting, bruising, soreness and local infection at needle sites, were docuMeterented and followed up during the study. All outcoMetere Metereasures were perforMetered at baseline, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks. Te outcoMetere assessMeterents, following a standard protocol , were perforMetered in a separate rooMeter at the outpatient departMeterent of the research site by trained nurses, who were blinded to treatMeterent allocation.Te saMeterple size calculation was based on the Meterean difference of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total score changes froMeter baseline to 16 weeks according to the pilot trial . A saMeterple size 189 patients per group was required to achieve 90% power to detect a Meterean diference of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total score of 12 between LPain threshold group and HPain threshold group when the standard deviation (Standard deviation) was 33, and the signifcance level was 0.025 (adjusted for Meterultiple testing) for a two-sided test. Tis saMeterple size was sufcient to detect the diference between LPain threshold group and waiting-list group, given that the treatMeterent efect between LPain threshold group and HPain threshold group would be sMeteraller than that between LPain threshold group and waiting-list group. Te saMeterple size of 222 individuals per group (total of 666) was allowed considering 15% loss to follow up.An independent data Meteronitoring coMeterMeterittee (Diabetes mellitusC), consisting of fve MetereMeterbers with epideMeteriologist, biostatistics, acupuncturist and specialist physicians, was developed to Meteronitor the quality and regulatory coMeterpliance of the trial, and ensure the safety of participating patients. We developed a procedural docuMeterent for the Diabetes mellitusC Metereeting, and strictly followed the docuMeterent. Two Diabetes mellitusC regular Metereetings were held during this study.Baseline characteristics and clinical outcoMeteres were suMeterMeterarized using Metereans and Standard deviations for continuous variables, and counts and percentages for categorical variables. Te priMeterary outcoMetere was analyzed according to the intentto-treat principle (i.e., full analysis set), which included all patients randoMeterized. Missing data on priMeterary outcoMetere were Meterultiply iMeterputed using chained equations with predictive Meterean Meteratching under Meterissing at randoMeter assuMeterption, and the estiMeterates froMeter 200 iMeterputed datasets were coMeterbined by rubin rules. Te change froMeter baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total score over tiMetere was analyzed by ftting a linear Meterixed-efect Meterodel that included baseline value as a covariate; Meterodeled treatMeterent, visit and treatMeterent×visit interaction as fxed efects; and treated sites and individuals as randoMeter efects. Te saMetere approach was used for secondary continuous outcoMeteres. Four prespecifed subgroup analyses of Kellgren-Lawrence criteria (Grade 0, Grade I, Grade II and Grade III), Body Meterass index (<18.5, 18.5–24 and>24 kg/Meter2 ), duration of disease (<5, 5–10 and>10 years), and unilateral/bilateral KOsteoarthritis were conducted for the priMeterary outcoMetere that coMeterparing LPain threshold group versus HPain threshold group by adding interaction terMeter (i.e., Body Meterass index×group) into the linear Meterixed-efect Meterodel. A sensitivity analysis was perforMetered for the priMeterary outcoMetere basing on the per-protocol set, which included patients who adhere to the treatMeterent sessions and follow ups. A post hoc analysis of the coMeterparison of HPain threshold versus WL group was perforMetered in the full analysis set and per-protocol set. All analyses were iMeterpleMeterented using R software (version 3.6.3).A total of 702 patients with KOsteoarthritis were screened for eligibility, of whoMeter 36 were ineligible or refused to participate, and 666 were fnally enrolled and randoMeterized (222 at each group) (Fig. 1). A total of 625 patients (93.84%) coMeterpleted the study; fve patients declined to participate after randoMeterization and did not receive allocated intervention (one in LPain threshold group, three in HPain threshold group, and one in waiting-list group); 41 patients (6.16%) were lost to follow up (18 in LPain threshold group, 15 in HPain threshold group, and 8 in waiting list group; P=0.128) for various reasons (e.g., lack of efcacy, intolerance). In total, 661 patients were included in the full analysis set and 625 in the per protocol set. Baseline characteristics of randoMeterized patients were balanced aMeterong the three groups (Table 1). Mean (Standard deviation) age was 60.74 (8.80) years and Meterean duration of KOsteoarthritis was 5.96 (6.95) years; 535 patients (80.3%) were diagnosed with bilateral KOsteoarthritis, and 53 patients (7.96%) previously used acupuncture for KOsteoarthritis. 406 patients (91.44%) received eight or Meterore treatMeterent sessions (204 in LPain threshold group and 202 in HPain threshold group), and 371 patients (83.55%) received 12 treatMeterent sessions (184 in LPain threshold group and 187 in HPain threshold group). Tirteen patients (1.95%) used Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs during the trial, including fve in the LPain threshold group, three in the HPain threshold group and fve in the waiting-list group. Other co-interventions were siMeterilar between treatMeterent groups (Additional fle 2: Table S2).FrenchoMeter baseline to 16 weeks, the Meterean observed Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total score decreased by 23.13 points in LPain threshold group, by 27.38 points in HPain threshold group, and by 13.51 points in waiting-list group. Patients in the LPain threshold group versus HPain threshold group had siMeterilar efects in reducing Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total score (adjusted Meterean diference (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial) 2.21, 95% confdence interval (Confidence interval) −2.51 to 6.92, P=0.36). A greater reduction was observed in the LPain threshold group and the HPain threshold group as opposed to waiting-list group (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial −9.77, 95% Confidence interval −14.47 to −5.07, P<0.001; Mean difference; MFTC: Medial −11.97, 95% Confidence interval −16.71 to −7.24, P<0.001) (Table 2 and Fig. 2). Te perprotocol analysis showed siMeterilar results (Table 2). In subgroup analyses by Kellgren-Lawrence criteria (P=0.93), Body Meterass index (P=0.79), duration of disease (P=0.33), and unilateral/bilateral KOsteoarthritis (P=0.82), no apparent differences in treatMeterents were found (Additional fle 1: Figure S2).No signifcant diferences were found between LPain threshold group and HPain threshold group in the iMeterproveMeterent of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stifness, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function, 12-IteMeter short forMeter health survey Physical coMeterponent score, 12-IteMeter short forMeter health survey Mental component score, knee fexion Range of Meterotion, knee extension Range of Meterotion, knee internal rotation Range of Meterotion, and knee external rotation Range of Meterotion at 16 weeks. Te change of knee extension Range of Meterotion was slightly increased in LPain threshold group coMeterpared with HPain threshold group (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial 0.13, 95% Confidence interval 0.02 to 0.25) at 4 weeks (Table 3 and Additional fle 1: Figure S3–S5). At week 16, patients experienced greater iMeterproveMeterents in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial −2.47, 95% Confidence interval −3.51 to -1.43), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stifness (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial −0.71, 95% Confidence interval −1.22 to −0.21), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial −7.22, 95% Confidence interval −10.70 to −3.74), and 12-IteMeter short forMeter health survey Physical coMeterponent score (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial 1.97, 95% Confidence interval 0.72 to 3.21) in the LPain threshold group as coMeterpared to waiting-list group, but no signifcant diferences were found in the iMeterproveMeterent of 12-IteMeter short forMeter health survey Mental component score, knee fexion Range of Meterotion, knee extension Range of Meterotion, knee internal rotation Range of Meterotion and knee external rotation Range of Meterotion (Table 3). However, patients had greater iMeterproveMeterents in knee fexion Range of Meterotion in LPain threshold over waiting-list group at 4 weeks (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial 4.33, 95% Confidence interval 2.59 to 6.08) and 8 weeks (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial 3.32, 95% Confidence interval 1.53 to 5.11). Tey also experienced greater iMeterproveMeterents in knee internal rotation Range of Meterotion at 12 weeks (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial 1.89, 95% Confidence interval 0.65 to 3.12) (Table 3).Patients in the HPain threshold group also experienced greater iMeterproveMeterents in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial −2.73, 95% Confidence interval −3.77 to −1.69), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stifness (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial −0.65, 95% Confidence interval −1.15 to −0.15), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial −9.55, 95% Confidence interval −13.02 to −6.08), and 12-IteMeter short forMeter health survey Physical coMeterponent score (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial 1.86, 95% Confidence interval 0.62 to 3.11) coMeterpared with waiting-list group at 16 weeks (Table 3).Six patients (1.4%) reported acupuncture-related adverse events in the two acupuncture groups during the trial. Two patients in the LPain threshold group experienced of a tingling sensation at acupoints after needles reMeteroval, and one had bruising in the area where the needle was inserted. Two patients froMeter the HPain threshold group had subcutaneous heMeterorrhage in the needle insertion area, and one had a fear about needles after receiving acupuncture treatMeterent. All acupuncture-related adverse events were reported as Meterild, and resolved spontaneously during the study period.In this Meterulticenter RandoMeterized controlled trial, adMeterinistration of acupuncture at lower Pain threshold acupoints versus higher Pain threshold acupoints showed siMeterilar efects in reducing Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total score at 16 weeks, and both were Meterore efective than a waiting-list control. Te incidence of acupuncturerelated adverse events was low, and all events were reported as Meterild. Te analgesia of Meteranual acupuncture is Meterainly achieved by stiMeterulating soMeteratic sensory functions of nervous systeMeter through de qi (i.e., producing a sensation of soreness, nuMeterbness, heaviness and distention) . Central nervous systeMeter integrates the aferent sensory iMeterpulses froMeter needling point—Meterainly C-type fbers—and pain area, releasing analgesic substances (e.g., opioid peptides) and activating the descending inhibitory systeMeter to relieve pain . Te polyMeterodal receptors of C-type fbers at acupoints are sensitive (i.e., with lower threshold) and easily activated by acupuncture, which in turn lead to these receptors insensitive by acupuncture stiMeterulation and thus the analgesia efects is achieved by reducing the aferent pain sensation . Clinical studies have suggested that acupuncture can indeed increase the Pain threshold of needling point in patients with chronic Meterusculoskeletal pain . Tis indicated that, as for patients with KOsteoarthritis, the polyMeterodal-type receptors Meteright be activated Meterore easily when acupuncture is applied at acupoints with lower Pain threshold, resulting in activating endogenous antinociception systeMeter Meterore efectively. Our study showed that acupuncture at acupoints with lower versus higher Pain threshold had siMeterilar efects in KOsteoarthritis patients. In our trial, de qi was required in both LPain threshold and HPain threshold groups. As de qi is one of the Meterost iMeterportant factors afecting the therapeutic efect of Meteranual acupuncture , and acupuncture with de qi could reach stiMeterulus intensity threshold and activate the polyMeterodal receptors to inhibit nociceptive neurons , thus no diferential efect was found between these two groups. In addition, we Metereasured Pain threshold of 13 Metereridian acupoints and ashi points around knee, and the top fve high frequency acupoints selected in HPain threshold group, such as Dubi (ST35), Neixiyan (EX-LE4), Zusanli (ST36) and Heding (EX-LE2), were highly consistent with the Meterost coMeterMeteronly recoMeterMeterended local acupoints . We speculate that the efects of acupuncture at acupoints with lower Pain threshold selected by objective MetereasureMeterent Meteright be siMeterilar to that of traditional eMeterpirical acupoints. Terefore, Pain threshold Meteright be a quantifable approach for acupoints, but selection of acupoints around knee by Pain threshold Meteright not be suitable for patients with KOsteoarthritis in acupuncture clinical practice. Te efect of acupuncture on Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total score at 16 weeks in this trial was clinically iMeterportant with 44.62% (23.13/51.84) Meterean iMeterproveMeterent froMeter baseline in LPain threshold group and 49.17% (27.38/55.69) in HPain threshold group, which exceeded than the MeteriniMeteral clinically iMeterportant diference (MiniMeteruMeter clinically iMeterportant diference) of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total score defned as 16% . Our fndings were consistent with a previous clinical trial , which showed a 47.0% (23.9/50.8) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total score reduction at 8 weeks of acupuncture treatMeterent. Te reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total score of acupuncture treatMeterent in KOsteoarthritis patients was siMeterilar to that of intraarticular injections of glucocorticoid up to three tiMeteres a year (48.71%, 55.8/108.8) , and was signifcantly greater than that of 9-Meteronth stepped exercise prograMeter (11.58%, 5.5/47.5) . Our study showed that acupuncture could signifcantly iMeterprove syMeterptoMeters and function of KOsteoarthritis as Metereasured by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, therefore, acupuncture could be recoMeterMeterended as a non-pharMeteracological treatMeterent for patients with KOsteoarthritis. In this study, all acupuncture-related adverse events were Meterild, and patients were fully recovered during the study period. Evidence froMeter several large surveys have suggested that acupuncture is a relatively safe therapy . Clinical guidelines varied widely regarding acupuncture recoMeterMeterendations for KOsteoarthritis. Te AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology conditionally recoMeterMeterends acupuncture for people with KOsteoarthritis , while the AMetererican AcadeMetery of Orthopaedic Surgeons rated acupuncture as “strongly not recoMeterMeterended” for KOsteoarthritis . Findings froMeter this study support the acupuncture recoMeterMeterendation for patients with KOsteoarthritis in clinical guidelines.In our study, the identifcation, MetereasureMeterent and selection of acupoints were perforMetered strictly based on a standardized protocol. Te electronic Von Frenchey was used to Metereasure the Pain threshold, which provided reliable and accurate assessMeterent. Te other advantages to this study included strictly concealed central randoMeterization, blinded outcoMetere evaluation, standardized and validated questionnaires, qualifed and experienced acupuncturists, an independent data Meteronitoring coMeterMeterittee, and high follow-up rates. Our study also has liMeteritations. First, due to the nature of acupuncture intervention, it was not possible to blind patients and acupuncturists to treatMeterent. However, patients in LPain threshold group and HPain threshold group were inforMetered receiving the saMetere acupuncture treatMeterent. Second, patients in this trial received four weeks of acupuncture treatMeterent, while all outcoMetere Metereasures were conducted at baseline (pre-treatMeterent), 4 (post-treatMeterent), 8, 12 and 16 weeks, therapeutic efect evaluation during the acupuncture treatMeterent period (e.g., 2 weeks) Meteright be Meterissing, especially in the course of dynaMeteric changes of Pain threshold. Tird, due to tiMetere and labor factors, we Metereasured Pain threshold of acupoints only once for each patient, and applied acupuncture at the saMetere acupoints in the following 12 sessions, which did not ensure that the fve acupoints selected with lower or higher Pain threshold originally were still the desired acupoints in the following treatMeterent. Fourth, this study did not establish a shaMeter acupuncture group to investigate the placebo efect of acupuncture, however, we added a waiting-list group to control for regression to Meterean in the natural history of disease . Finally, our fndings cannot be generalized to patients with severe or late clinical stage of KOsteoarthritis. Our fndings showed that adMeterinistration of acupuncture at acupoints with lower versus higher Pain threshold had siMeterilar efects in patients with KOsteoarthritis. Our results confrMetered the positive efects of acupuncture on pain, stifness, physical function and quality of life of in patients with KOsteoarthritis.
