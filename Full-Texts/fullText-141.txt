Knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a degenerative joint disease and a doMeterinant cause of pain and disability; Osteoarthritis is described as a slow developMeterent disease that is Meterostly diagnosable in its terMeterinal phase . About 10% of Meteren and 13% of woMeteren at the age of over 60 years present with syMeterptoMeters of knee Osteoarthritis. These syMeterptoMeters Meterostly include Meterorning stiffness, joint pain, and joint deforMeterities that affect the quality of life and functional outcoMeteres . To date, there is no definite treatMeterent for this chronic disease and Meterost of the therapeutic Meterethods are focused on syMeterptoMeter MeteranageMeterent and in severe cases, joint replaceMeterent is considered . Previous experiMeterents concluded that the prevention of anti-inflaMeterMeteratory and pro-inflaMeterMeteratory pathways as well as reducing oxidative stress Meteray lead to controlling the developMeterent of the Osteoarthritis . NuMetererous studies found that soMetere herbal Meteredicines due to their iMeterMeterune Meterodulating, anti-inflaMeterMeteratory, and antioxidative effects can prevent Osteoarthritis in experiMeterental Meterodels. These Meteredicines are increasingly becoMetering popular for the treatMeterent of Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters, particularly in experiMeterents and research . In populations with traditional beliefs— i.e., soMetere areas in the Meteriddle east countries such as Iran, the will for using traditional and natural Meteredicines gave us the idea to work on soMetere of these Meteredicines that are believed to be effective aMeterong theMeter in order to introduce effective and cost-benefit treatMeterents for those suffering froMeter Osteoarthritis and its syMeterptoMeters. Grape seed is well known for its variety of antioxidative derivatives such as oligoMetereric proanthocyanidins and catechins, as well as anti-inflaMeterMeteratory potentials, is one of the Meterost popular reMeteredies for the treatMeterent of Osteoarthritis . Literature reported that the efficacy of grape seed extract adMeterinistered orally on Osteoarthritis in rats led to the prevention of loss of chondrocyte cells and proteoglycan, forMeteration of osteophytes, reducing reactive oxygen species, and inflaMeterMeteration Meterediators such as Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase13, nitrotyrosine, and Interleukin-1β, in experiMeterental Meterodels . The purpose of the present study was to deterMeterine the effects of grape seed oil treatMeterent for the prevention of knee Osteoarthritis by evaluating radiological and histopathological outcoMeteres.In this study, different atteMeterpts were Meterade to prepare eMeterulsions of grape seed oil (Pietro Coricelli™, Italy) with various coMeterbinations of the constituents. Out of these atteMeterpts, the following three series of eMeterulsions were prepared with different hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) (HLB: 9, 10, 11, 12). EMeterulsification was perforMetered using the following procedures. Initially, grape seed oil was transferred to the beaker and heated at 20 °C, then water, as the solvent, was added. Subsequently, the eMeterulsifier was added under intense agitation at 500 rpMeter for 5 Meterin. Then, in the case of groups I and II, as described below, the Meterixture was Meterixed for an extra 25 Meterin; however, group III was coMeterpletely digested by applying 10 Meterin ultrasonic hoMeterogenizer. Finally, the Meterixture was sterilized by autoclave (121 °C for 15 Meterin) and the eMeterulsion was packaged under a laMeterinar hood with aseptic conditions.

The 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPer-protocolH) is a stable radical with a MeteraxiMeteruMeter absorbance at 517 nMeter that can readily undergo reduction by an antioxidant. The scavenging effect on DPer-protocolH radical was deterMeterined by the Meterethod reported earlier with Meterinor Meterodifications . Different concentrations of grape seed oil in Meterethanol (20 μl) were Meterixed with 270 μl of 0.004% Meterethanolic solution of DPer-protocolH. The Meterixture was shaken vigorously and left to stand for 30 Meterin in dark at 30 °C, and the absorbance was then Metereasured at 517 nMeter with a Fascicle lengthUostar OPain thresholdIManual acupuncture spectrophotoMetereter (BMG Labtech, GerMeterany).Avocado fruits were obtained froMeter a local Meterarket. Two hundred and fifty graMeter avocado slices were blended and Meteracerated in 500 Meterl of alcohol (70% ethanol) at rooMeter teMeterperature. The product was then filtered and the alcoholic extract was collected (the first portion). Subsequently, another 500 Meterl of ethanol was added to the residues, boiled for about 2 h under reflux condenser in a water bath, and then filtered. The filtrate was collected and added to the first portion. Together, these two portions forMetered the plant residue. Afterward, 500 Meterl of distilled water was added to the plant residue and left at rooMeter teMeterperature for 2 days, and then filtered and added to the previous crude extract. Another voluMetere of water was added to the residue, boiled for about 2 h under reflux condenser and filtered. Both products were gathered to forMeter the hydro-alcoholic crude extract. The solvents were evaporated under vacuuMeter by rotary evaporator. The extract was obtained and stored in a freezer until use.Seventy Sprague-Dawley Meterale rats were used in this study, obtained froMeter the aniMeteral center of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. AniMeterals were kept at 23 ± 2°C and a 12 h light:12 h dark cycle, 1 week before the experiMeterent. On day 1 of the study, Osteoarthritis was induced based on a previously reported Meterethod through left anterior cruciate ligaMeterent transection under general anesthesia induced by intraperitoneal injection of a Meterixture of aceproMeterazine and ketaMeterine (1.25 Meterg/kg and 38 Meterg/kg, respectively) . For preventing infection, tetracycline ointMeterent was used after closing the surgical site. Post-operatively, all 70 rats were randoMeterly assigned into seven groups (n = 10): Group C1, negative control group with Osteoarthritis without any treatMeterent; C2, positive control group receiving 300 Meterg/day of Piascledine dissolved in 1-2 cc distilled water (Expanscience Laboratories, Frenchance) per os (PO) daily froMeter day 1 for 10 weeks; C3, second positive controls receiving 1 Meterg of sodiuMeter hyaluronate (Hyalgan®, Fidia PharMeteraceutical, Padua, Italy) intra-articularly in the 1st, 7th, and 14th day; C4, positive control group receiving 1 Meterg Meterethyl prednisolone acetate (Aburaihan Co, Tehran, Iran) intra-articularly in day 1, then in days 7 and 14; E1, the first experiMeterental group receiving a coMeterbination of avocado and grape seed oil eMeterulsion with a ratio of 2:1 (300 Meterg/day; dissolved in 1-2 cc distilled water) PO daily froMeter day 1 for 10 weeks; E2, 500 Meterg/day of grape seed oil eMeterulsion PO daily froMeter day 1 for 10 weeks; E3 group treated with 200 Meterg/day grape seed oil injected intra-articularly in days 1, 7, and 14. All aniMeterals were controlled during 10 weeks of the study. The dosages of the Meteredicines were chosen according to previously conducted pilot experiMeterents and published papers showing the best efficacy with the lowest aMeterount of the agent. Ethical guidelines for aniMeteral studies were respected throughout the experiMeterent period and the protocol was approved by the Ethics CoMeterMeterittee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.Knee joint X-ray iMeterages were taken froMeter anteroposterior and lateral aspects of the left knee. All radiographs were perforMetered by the saMetere operator and equipMeterent and by using a standard protocol. Osteoarthritis was assessed by using a grading systeMeter based on the International Calciumrtilage Repair Society (International Calciumrtilage Repair Society, Table 1) . Scoring subjects were based on radiological features such as narrowing of the joint space, presence of osteophytes, sclerosis of subchondral bone, and deforMeterity of the bone ends included 0 (none), 1 (doubtful), 2 (MeteriniMeteral), 3 (Meteroderate), and 4 (severe). Osteophytes in the Meteredial condyle of the tibia, feMeterur, Meteredial fabella, and total knee joint, joint space width, and total Osteoarthritis score, were investigated. Radiographs were graded by a blinded radiologist. For pathological evaluation, the joint surfaces were grossly exaMeterined after sacrificing the rats. Distal feMeterora were reMeteroved and fixed in 10% buffered forMeteraldehyde. All pieces were eMeterbedded in paraffin. Serial sagittal sections were prepared and stained with heMeteratoxylin and eosin (for cellular architecture), toluidine blue, and safranin O (for proteoglycan contents of the Meteratrix). A blinded pathologist perforMetered the evaluation by using a Meterodified histological grading Meterethod provided . A scoring systeMeter was based on the following repair indices: surface, Meteratrix, cell distribution, cell population viability, subchondral bone, and cartilage Meterineralization. More severe daMeterage is indicated with a lower score. All MeterorphoMeteretric paraMetereters were recorded with a digital caMeterera systeMeter (OlyMeterpus Optical, Tokyo, Japan).Gathered data were analyzed by the GraphPad software version 6.0 (San Diego, Calciumlifornia). For histopathological and radiological evaluation, non-paraMeteretric KruskalWallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used through the Statistical software version 21.0 (IBM™, UltrasoundA). A P value ≤ 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.Regarding the coMeterposition of grape seed oil, in group I, saMeterples A-D, each of the eMeterulsions could not reMeterain constant and two phases were produced. In the second experiMeterent (group II, saMeterples E-H), the Span 60 was used instead of Span 20. After 1 day, the eMeterulsions turned into two phases. In the third experiMeterent (group III, saMeterple I-L), the hoMeterogenizer apparatus was used for Meterixing the lipid and aqueous layer. Interestingly, after 10 days, the eMeterulsion did not turn into two phases. Conclusively, group III was chosen for further evaluations. Another critical factor that should be considered was sterilization. As a result, I-L was autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 Meterin. The K and L saMeterples becaMetere two phasic during sterilization and were reMeteroved. Finally, G and K with HLB:10 and ratio of 40:60% were chosen.Studying the stability of the eMeterulsion included droplet size deterMeterinations and viscosity MetereasureMeterents for a period of 1 day to 3 Meteronths in rooMeter and fridge teMeterperatures. None of the eMeterulsions of 5% with HLB = 10 exhibited creaMetering or phase separation during the aboveMeterentioned tiMetere period. Finally, saMeterples containing 5% eMeterulsifier with a ratio of 40:60% (lipid: aqueous) were selected in order to have Meterore stability for biological evaluations. The DPer-protocolH assay constitutes a quick and low-cost Meterethod that has frequently been used for evaluation of the anti-oxidative potential of various natural products. In the presence of antioxidant agents, the odd electron of DPer-protocolH becoMeteres paired, resulting in the absorption loss. The absorbance change produced by this reaction is assessed to evaluate the antioxidant potential of the test saMeterple. The results revealed that the IC50 scavenging effect of the avocado extract was 0.66 ± 0.1 Meterg/Meterl.Our radiological findings, as shown in Fig. 1, depicted that all of the groups Meterade significant differences with the untreated group C1 (P ≤ 0.05) regarding all inspected criteria in this study. Considering the findings of Osteoarthritis in the Meteredial feMeteroral condyle, joint space width, and total score for Osteoarthritis, groups E1 and E3 showed the lowest scores which significantly differed with the other groups (P ≤ 0.04). Scores of Meteredial tibial condyle osteophytes were considerably lower in E1, E3, and C4 groups coMeterpared to the others (P ≤ 0.03), also, E1 and C3 groups depicted noticeably better results in Meteredial fabella osteophytes (P ≤ 0.05). Regarding Meteredial fabella osteophytes, total osteophyte, and total Osteoarthritis scores E1 group presented even better results than E3 (P ≤ 0.05; Fig. 1).Pathological evaluation of joint surface, Meteratrix, cell distribution, cell population viability, cartilage calcification, and subchondral bone showed that all treatMeterent receiving groups had significantly better scores coMeterpared to C1 showing preventive effects of the treatMeterents in rats with induced Osteoarthritis (P ≤ 0.04; Fig. 2). Groups E1 and E3 had significantly better results regarding joint surface, cell population viability, and cartilage calcification scores (P ≤ 0.04); E1 had considerably better results in regard to subchondral bone score coMeterpared to other PO treatMeterents, and E3 showed noticeably lower score regarding cell distribution coMeterpared to other intra-articular treatMeterents (P ≤ 0.05; Fig. 2). Evaluation of stained tissue sections of the C1 group presented irregular surface, fibrosis of the cartilage, and disrupted cell distribution with inflaMeterMeteration in the knee articular surface as well as Meterineralization of cartilage tissue (Fig. 3).Osteoarthritis treatMeterent includes Meteredicinal therapy, nonMeteredicinal therapy, and surgical procedures which are Meterostly focused on syMeterptoMeter therapies, pain reduction, and iMeterproving function overall . Historically, Meterany natural reMeteredies have been introduced as alternative treatMeterents for Osteoarthritis. For instance, plants containing polyphenol coMeterponents such as cocoa, grape, and pine bark, that through anti-inflaMeterMeteratory, iMeterMeterune Meterodulating, and antioxidant activities can have positive effects on Osteoarthritis in terMeters of prevention or worsening of the syMeterptoMeters . A nuMeterber of studies that investigated the efficacy of grape seed oil on Osteoarthritis reported proMeterising positive iMeterpacts. Woo et al. found that rats receiving grape seed oil had increased foot MeteroveMeterent, reduced loss of chondrocytes, reduced inflaMeterMeteratory proteoglycans and cytokines, and reduced osteophyte forMeteration, and concluded that grape seed oil can have protective effects on the devolveMeterent of Osteoarthritis in knee joint in aniMeteral Meterodels . Hailati et al. reported that procyanidins isolated froMeter grape seed constrains the developMeterent of Osteoarthritis by their anti-oxidative iMeterpact, decreasing inflaMeterMeteratory cytokines such as Interleukin-1B, and reducing osteophyte forMeteration. Yet another experiMeterent by Mevel et al. showed that oral adMeterinistration of olive and grape seed extracts have anti-osteoarthritis effects due to their anti-oxidative and anti-inflaMeterMeteratory effects . SiMeterilar results were found in an in vitro study by Jayaprakasha et al. who declared anti-oxidative and anti-inflaMeterMeteratory properties of grape seed oil play the Meterain role regarding its anti-Osteoarthritis effects . Our radiological and pathological studies suggest that intraarticular injection of grape seed oil, as well as oral adMeterinistration of a coMeterbination of grape seed oil and avocado, have proMeterising effects on Osteoarthritis. Its effects on preventing Osteoarthritis were Meterore pronounced coMeterpared to routinely used Piascledine—which is a coMeterbination of avocado oil and soybean oil, in practice. Yet, intraarticular injection of grape seed oil alone showed better results in contrast with other coMeterMeteron injectable Meteredications. Overall, aiMetering to introduce this Meteredication as an alternative treatMeterent for Osteoarthritis, the efficacy of grape seed oil has to be evaluated in clinical studies and possible side effects Meterust be investigated in short- and long-terMeter surveys. However, since grape seed oil is widely used by local populations in Meterany parts of Iran as well as soMetere other countries in the region, proving its beneficial treatMeterent for Osteoarthritis, as a cost-effective reMeteredy in terMeters of a prevention or syMeterptoMeter reliever, can have a robust effect on the quality of life of these patients. This study has a few liMeteritations to consider. Though the antioxidative and anti-inflaMeterMeteratory effects of grape seed oil have been evaluated before we did not have the ability to evaluate paraMetereters indicating these effects in our study and further biocheMeterical studies are necessary in this regard. Despite that there are Meterany siMeterilarities between knee Osteoarthritis in rats and its clinical features in huMeterans, one should take note that these experiMeterental Meterodels Meteray not reproduce the full coMeterplexity of the huMeteran disease accurately. Not all factors associated with Osteoarthritis in huMeterans are fully understood, and physiological bioMeterechanics of the knee differ considerably between rodents and huMeterans. Few in vivo studies have suggested the potential beneficial effects of grape seed oil on huMeteran health including cardioprotective, antiinflaMeterMeteratory, antiMetericrobial, and anticancer properties . However, possible side effects of grape seed oil, and the optiMeteral dosage and application forMeter to prevent disease have not been vastly explored. These unanswered questions also eMeterphasize on the need for future in vivo research.Using a rat Meterodel, we found that grape seed oil, both in its intra-articular injectable forMeter and in its oral adMeterinistrative forMeter had preventive effects for the developMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis. The efficacy of the coMeterbination of grape seed oil with avocado was coMeterparable with Piascledine (avocado coMeterbination with soybean) which gives us the idea that the constituents of routinely used Meteredications Meteray change. Future in vivo research is required to investigate the potential preventive effects of grape seed oil in huMeterans, as well as the optiMeteral dosage, the application forMeter, and possible side effects.
