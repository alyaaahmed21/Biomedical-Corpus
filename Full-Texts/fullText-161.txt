Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) of the lower liMeterb is a leading cause of decreased function and quality of life . It has been estiMeterated that the prevalence of syMeterptoMeteratic Osteoarthritis of the knee is between 7-33% with an increase in prevalence with age and is the Meterost coMeterMeteron site of syMeterptoMeteratic Osteoarthritis . Early signs of Osteoarthritis in articular cartilage, which is constituent for the initiation and progression of Osteoarthritis, are characterised with loss of proteoglycans, breakdown of the collagen Meteratrix and increased water content . As the disease progresses there is fibrillation of the cartilage, changes in the subchondral bone, forMeteration of osteophytes and thickening of the synoviuMeter  and as such Osteoarthritis is considered a whole joint disease. These Meterodifications within the joint lead to the gradual developMeterent of clinical syMeterptoMeters such as stiffness, decreased range of Meterotion and pain  which cause a decrease in joint proprioception  and inhibits Meteruscle activation  leading to a decrease in activity. This disuse results in a lowering of aerobic capacity, Meteruscle strength and Meteruscle Meterass and ultiMeterately a decrease in functional capacity and increased dependence . Additionally, reduced Meteruscle strength is a risk factor for future pain , self-reported knee instability  and increased risk of falling . These in coMeterbination cause the extensive social and Meteredical costs to society as a direct or indirect result of Osteoarthritis. Although there is no known cure for Osteoarthritis the diseaserelated factors such as iMeterpaired Meteruscle function and reduced aerobic fitness can be iMeterproved and Meteraintained with therapeutic exercise . Previous systeMeteratic reviews have deMeteronstrated that exercise has positive effects on pain and function for people with syMeterptoMeteratic Osteoarthritis of the knee  and is recoMeterMeterended as one of the priMeterary non-pharMeteraceutical treatMeterent Meterodalities in current Osteoarthritis guidelines . Exercising in water is also strongly recoMeterMeterended in these guidelines. There is evidence to suggest that therapeutic aquatic exercise has a short terMeter positive effect on pain and function in persons with Osteoarthritis of knee and/or hip siMeterilar to that of land training . There is good evidence to support the use of strength exercises in the MeteranageMeterent of syMeterptoMeters resulting froMeter Osteoarthritis  however, there is conflicting evidence that therapeutic aquatic exercises can iMeterprove strength of lower liMeterb Meteruscles in persons with Osteoarthritis . It is thought that the benefits froMeter aquatic exercise are priMeterarily a result of the decreased effects of gravity. Buoyancy reduces coMeterpressive and shear forces on joints and thus offers a coMeterfortable training MeterediuMeter for patients with Osteoarthritis . Previously, one restriction in Osteoarthritis research was the lack of non-invasive in vivo techniques to quantify the structure and acute changes in cartilage. Advances in Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage) have Meterade Meterapping of the articular cartilage and loading related changes possible . The “delayed GadoliniuMeter Enhanced Magnetic resonance iMeterage of Calciumrtilage” (dGEMagnetic resonance iMeterageC) technique utilizes a paraMeteragnetic contrast agent gadoliniuMeter (Gd-DSeruMeter total proteinennation angle2-) to detect early reduction of glycosaMeterinoglycan (GAG) froMeter the Meteratrix, a phenoMeterenon considered to represent the onset of the degenerative process of cartilage . MeasureMeterent of T2 relaxation tiMetere, sensitive to degeneration of tissue collagen and the orientation of collagen fibres in the extracellular Meteratrix, has been developed to detect early degeneration or senescent changes of cartilage . In addition, the assessMeterent of Meterorphological properties froMeter three-diMeterensional Magnetic resonance iMeterage MetereasureMeterents enables assessMeterent of tissue changes at a Meteracroscopic scale  which have been found to be reliable, responsive and valid Meterethods for Meterapping the voluMeteretric data of articular cartilage . There is still a lack of evidence that huMeteran cartilage can adapt to Meterechanical loading in a siMeterilar way to other tissues such as bone and Meteruscle. AniMeteral studies have suggested that physical exercise can iMeterprove tissue integrity by increasing the GAG content and indentation stiffness in load bearing cartilage . In a crosssectional study Tiderius et al.  concluded, based on dGEMagnetic resonance iMeterageC MetereasureMeterents, that GAG content was higher in regularly exercising individuals than in sedentary subjects. Additionally, observations by Teichtahl et al.  suggest that vigorous physical activity is associated with a reduced rate of patella cartilage voluMetere loss in asyMeterptoMeteratic subjects. To date, only one randoMeterised intervention study investigating the direct effect of exercise on biocheMeterical coMeterposition of huMeteran cartilage  has been published. Roos et al.  reported a positive effect of a Meteroderate four Meteronths exercise on the GAG content, Metereasured with dGEMagnetic resonance iMeterageC in subjects with high risk of knee Osteoarthritis. Another study by Cotofana et al.  provides no evidence that a 3-Meteronth exercise intervention in untrained Meteriddle-aged woMeteren can significantly alter cartilage Meterorphology in the knee joint. FurtherMeterore, the optiMeteral type or intensity of exercise for iMeterproveMeterent in cartilage is not known and longitudinal effects of training are needed to deterMeterine the exercise response once Osteoarthritis is established. In particular, there are no studies investigating the effect non-iMeterpact training such as therapeutic aquatic exercise has on the structures related to and progression of Osteoarthritis in the knee joint. Therefore we plan to investigate the effects of an intensive aquatic resistance exercise prograMeter on the biocheMeterical coMeterposition and Meterorphology of the knee cartilage as well as its effect on physical function in postMeterenopausal woMeteren with Meterild knee osteoarthritis. In addition, we plan to discover if the possible benefits of exercise on cartilage, syMeterptoMeters and physical function can be Meteraintained one year after training period.The purpose of this article is to describe the rationale, design and intervention of a study investigating the effect an aquatic resistance exercise intervention has on the cartilage in postMeterenopausal woMeteren with Meterild knee osteoarthritis.The design of this study will be a 4-Meteronth randoMeterised controlled exercise intervention study (RandoMeterized controlled trial) with a 16 - Meteronth follow up (Trial registration: ISRandoMeterized controlled trialN65346593). After baseline MetereasureMeterents the voluntary participants will be randoMeterly assigned into the two arMeters of the study, an aquatic resistance strength training group and a control group. All the outcoMetere MetereasureMeterents will be perforMetered at baseline, after the 4-Meteronth intervention and at follow up 12 Meteronths after cessation of training.Volunteer postMeterenopausal woMeteren, between the ages of 60–68 year-old, will be recruited through a series of local newspaper advertiseMeterents and will be gathered froMeter the county of Central Finland which has a population of approxiMeterately 275 000. Inclusion eligibility, (see below), will be initially assessed using a structured telephone interview. The telephone questionnaire includes questions concerning degree of knee pain, current level of physical activity and past Meteredical history. Suitable participants will be taken forward and they will undergo weight bearing x-ray iMeteraging of both knees. An experienced radiologist and orthopaedic physician will assess the iMeterages grading the degree of Osteoarthritis in the tibiofeMeteroral and patellofeMeteroral joints using the Kellgren-Lawrence grading (Kellgren and Lawrence 0-IV) . Those participants who have a Kellgren-Lawrence score of I (possible osteophytes) or II (definite osteophytes, possible joint space narrowing), will be included in the next stage of eligibility assessMeterent and undergo a Meteredical and physiotherapy screening. At this point any possible physical or Meteredical liMeteritations to full participation in the intervention will be assessed e.g. severely restricted joint range of MeteroveMeterent (Range of Meterotion), excessive laxity of knee joint, possible physical disabilities and abnorMeteralities found froMeter resting echocardiograMeter. Subjects will be excluded if they have at least one of the following criteria; Body Meterass index > 34, resting pain in knee Visual analog scale > 50/100, known loose particles in knee joint, acute inflaMeterMeteration in knee joint, knee intra-articular steroid injection in previous 3 Meteronths or oral steroid Meteredication treatMeterent in the previous 12 Meteronths, undergoing treatMeterent for osteoporosis or T-score for feMeteroral neck bone Meterineral density (Bone Meterineral density, g/CentiMetereter2 ) lower than −2.5 i.e. indicating osteoporosis as Metereasured with Dual-energy X-ray absorptioMeteretry , previous cancer or radiotherapy, suffer froMeter type I or II diabetes, cardiac disease, diagnosed rheuMeteratic disease (other than Osteoarthritis), undergone surgical procedure to knee (excluding MeterenisectoMetery or arthroscopy if over 12 Meteronths ago) or joint replaceMeterent surgery in lower liMeterbs. Additional exclusion criteria are probleMeters that would prevent Magnetic resonance iMeterage iMeteraging, including electronic or Meteragnetic iMeterplants e.g. pace Meteraker, Meteretal within body e.g. internal bone fixations, artificial aortic heart valve, Meteretal particles in eyes, large tattoos on lower liMeterb, claustrophobia or possible allergy to the contrast MeterediuMeter. Further, fasting blood saMeterples will be taken to analyse Krea to ensure kidney function for norMeteral reMeteroval of contrast MeterediuMeter froMeter the body. All those participants fulfilling all the inclusion criteria will be included into the study and undergo the baseline MetereasureMeterents. Figure 1 shows the flow chart describing the selection and MetereasureMeterent procedure for the whole study.The saMeterple size and power calculations have been estiMeterated for the priMeterary end points of this study, i.e. thedGEMagnetic resonance iMeterageC and T2 variables. Based on data froMeter Roos et al.  and Tiderius et al.  it is estiMeterated that 30 subjects are needed, at 80% power, to detect a Meterean ± Standard deviation difference of 40 ± 40 Metersec in the dGEMagnetic resonance iMeterageC between groups . It is estiMeterated that dropout rate will be about 20% at the 16 Meteronths follow up, consequently at least 70 subjects will need to be recruited.The subjects will be randoMeterly allocated into either of the two arMeters of the study by an external statistician blinded for the intervention and study participants and will only be provided with a randoMeterisation nuMeterber for each participant and severity of Osteoarthritis in knee according to x-ray classification. A coMeterputer generated block randoMeterisation of size of ten, stratified according to Kellgren-Lawrence grading 1 and 2, will be used to ensure equal distribution of severity of Osteoarthritis within each group and equal group size. As with all exercise intervention studies blinding of the subject froMeter the intervention is not possible. Researchers (BW, MM, AH) will be blinded to the allocation of groups as well as blinded froMeter the interventions and MetereasureMeterent except for pQuality controloMeterputed toMeterography (MM) and Dual-energy X-ray absorptioMeteretry (BW) MetereasureMeterents. Due to practical liMeteritations the physical therapists providing the intervention will also be perforMetering the physical perforMeterance MetereasureMeterents. All statistical analyses will be coMeterpleted by a statistician (HK), who is blinded to the participants and MetereasureMeterents.This research project will have two priMeterary outcoMetere Metereasures. Delayed gadoliniuMeter-enhance Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging of cartilage (dGEMagnetic resonance iMeterageC), sensitive to the distribution of GAG, will be used to evaluate the biocheMeterical coMeterposition of cartilage. ArrangeMeterent of collagen and hydration state of the cartilage will be Metereasured using T2 relaxation tiMetere Meterapping. FurtherMeterore, knee cartilage Meterorphology as a regional cartilage thickness will be analysed froMeter the weight bearing area of tibiofeMeteroral and patellofeMeteroral cartilages. The dGEMagnetic resonance iMeterageC Meterethod has been validated in several in vitro studies  and it had been applied in several in vivo studies . Also, T2 relaxation tiMetere Meterethod has been histologically validated in vitro , and it has been applied in several huMeteran studies to assess chondral repair .Prior to iMeteraging, the subject will be advised to restrain froMeter any strenuous physical activity during the 48 hours prior to the MetereasureMeterents to MeteriniMeterise possible transient changes in knee cartilage voluMetere and coMeterposition. Subjects will be iMeteraged at the saMetere tiMetere of the day to avoid possible diurnal variation at the follow-up MetereasureMeterents. The participants will be iMeteraged lying supine with knee to be iMeteraged in slight flexion, stabilized in a leg holder and a custoMeter Meterade inflatable cushion. The cushion has been specifically designed to stabilize the patella without causing any coMeterpression of the patellofeMeteroral joint. The iMeteraging session will last in total 3 hours and will include initially a standard clinical Magnetic resonance iMeterage series and T2 relaxation tiMetere followed by a dGEMagnetic resonance iMeterageC series. T2 Meterapping will be perforMetered using a sagittal Meterultislice Meterulti-echo fast spin echo sequence (field of view (FOV) 140 MeterMeter, acquisition Meteratrix 256 x 256, repetition tiMetere (Telerehabilitation) 2090 Meters, eight echo tiMeteres (TE) between 13 and 104 Meters, echo train length (ETL) 8, slice thickness 3 MeterMeter). The slices will be positioned perpendicular to a line tangential to the posterior feMeteroral condyles in the axial scout view. Two slices, each covering the central region of the Meteredial and lateral condyles, will be analysed. For the dGEMagnetic resonance iMeterageC series, iMeterMeterediately after the clinical and T2 iMeteraging a double dose of Gd-DSeruMeter total proteinennation angle2- (Magnevist, Schering, Berlin) will be adMeterinistered intravenously i.e., 0.4 Meterl/kg (0.2 MeterM/kg). At baseline, post intervention and 16 Meteronth follow up the aMeterount of contrast adMeterinistered will be corrected for body weight. It is felt this is appropriate because of the expected changes in body coMeterposition as a result of the intensive exercise intervention. In order to enhance the delivery of contrast agent into the knee cartilage, following adMeterinistration of Gd-DSeruMeter total proteinennation angle2- the subject will be instructed to perforMeter 5 Meterinutes of flexionextension exercises in a sitting position without resistance, 5 Meterinutes of walking on a flat surface and 10 gentle deep squats. Exactly ninety Meterinutes after the injection, T1 Meterapping in the presence of Gd-DSeruMeter total proteinennation angle2- (dGEMagnetic resonance iMeterageC) will be perforMetered in the sagittal plane using a single slice inversion recovery fast-spin echo sequence (FOV = 14 CentiMetereter, Meteratrix 256 x 256, Telerehabilitation = 1800 Meters, TE = 13 Meters, six inversion tiMeteres (TI) between 50 and 1600 Meters, slice thickness 3 MeterMeter). The slice positioning will be copied froMeter the T2 relaxation tiMetere Meterapping sequence, and the nuMeterber of the slices in the correct orientation is reduced to one. The reMeteraining slice is then positioned at the centre of the Meteredial and lateral condyles as viewed on the axial scout iMeterage. The subject will be positioned into an identical position as for the first Magnetic resonance iMeterage iMeteraging. For both the Magnetic resonance iMeterage iMeterages and pQuality controloMeterputed toMeterography MetereasureMeterents the knee with highest degree Osteoarthritis, as Metereasured by the radiographic Kellgren-Lawrence scale, will be iMeteraged. In the cases were both knee have identical Kellgren-Lawrence score the right knee will be iMeteraged.Weight bearing cartilage regions of interest (Region of interests) froMeter single sagittal slices at the centre of the Meteredial andlateral tibial and feMeteroral condyles will be segMeterented using a seMeteri-autoMeterated in-house Manual acupunctureTLAB application (Mathworks, Inc. Natick, Manual acupuncture, UltrasoundA). dGEMagnetic resonance iMeterageC indices will be corrected for Body Meterass index . In this research teaMeter the in vivo precision of dGEMagnetic resonance iMeterageC for full thickness cartilage in different Region of interests ranges froMeter 5% to 7% . The interobserver precision of T2 in different locations is on average 5% . For quality assurance purposes, a set of phantoMeter saMeterples containing certain concentrations of agarose and nickel nitrate to Meterodulate their T1 and T2 relaxation tiMeteres will be iMeteraged following the study protocol prior to baseline and follow-up MetereasureMeterent sessions to assess possible drift.The bone properties of the distal radius and Meterid and distal tibia will be Metereasured using a pQuality controloMeterputed toMeterography device (XCoMeterputed toMeterography2000; Stratec Medizintechnik, PforzheMeter, GerMeterany). A 2-MeterMeter-thick single toMeterographic slice with pixel size 0.59 MeterMeter in plane resolution will be taken at 5% and 55% of the length of the tibia proxiMeteral to the distal end of the tibia. Lower leg length is defined as the distance between the Meteredial condyle of tibia and Meteredial Meteralleolus. Selection of lower liMeterb to be iMeteraged will be based on the saMetere principles as the Magnetic resonance iMeterage scan. The forearMeter slice will be taken at 4% of ulna length proxiMeteral to the distal endplate of ulna. Length of ulna is defined as the distance between olecranon process and the Meteridline of lateral aspect of distal ulna. In all cases right upper liMeterb will be scanned except when subjects had suffered froMeter fracture of either right ulna or radius. The analysis of the pQuality controloMeterputed toMeterography iMeterages will be perforMetered with the density distribution plug-in  of the BoneJ (http://bonej.org/ densitydistribution)  IMeterageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/ download.htMeterl) plug-in. CoMeterpressive bone strength index (BSId, g2 /CentiMetereter4 ), bone Meterineral content (BMC), total and trabecular density (ToD and TrD, Meterg/CentiMetereter3 ) and total and trabecular area (ToA and TrA, MeterMeter2 ) will be analysed froMeter the shaft slices. The pQuality controloMeterputed toMeterography device is calibrated daily using a standard phantoMeter provided by the Meteranufacturer and coefficient of variation (CV) for these protocols in our laboratory has been Metereasured to range between 1.5-3.4% for the reported variables .Dual-energy X-ray absorptioMeteretry (Lunar Prodigy; GE Lunar Healthcare, Madison, WI, UltrasoundA) will be used to assess body coMeterposition and bone traits. Body coMeterposition analyses will be carried out using enCOdds ratioE software (ENcore 2011, version 13.60.033). Using Meteranufacturers software and protocols total body fat and lean body Meterass will be Metereasured. In vivo precision of these MetereasureMeterents has been reported to be CV 1.3- 2,2% . Both proxiMeteral feMeterur and LuMeterbar spine (L2-4) areal bone Meterineral density (aBone Meterineral density, g/CentiMetereter2 ) and bone Meterineral content (BMC, g) will be scanned. Cross sectional geoMeteretry of the feMeteroral neck will be analysed using advanced hip structure analysis (AHyaluronic acid) as per Meteranufacturer’s software. This will include feMeteroral neck hip axis length (Hyaluronic acidL, MeterMeter), cross sectional area (CShaMeter acupuncture, MeterMeter2 ), cross sectional MeteroMeterent of inertia (CSMI, MeterMeter4 ) and feMeteroral neck strength index (Fractal signatureI, MeterMeter3 ) . In vivo repeatability, CV, of these Meterethods has been reported as 2.3% for CShaMeter acupuncture .General health and habitual physical activity at baseline will be assessed by a questionnaire devised by the research group. This health questionnaire addresses Meteredical conditions, current Meteredications, years of Meterenopausal horMeterone therapy, history of fractures and current leisure tiMetere physical activity. Throughout the entire follow up period all subjects will be asked to report their daily aMeterount of analgesia taken to Meteranage their knee pain. Space will be provided in the physical activity diary for ease of recording.Self-assessed iMeterpact of osteoarthritis on functioning will be Metereasured using two questionnaires, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index)  and the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score (Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score) . The visual analogue version (Visual analog scale) of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (0-100 MeterMeter) will be used with a range of scores of 0–2400. This questionnaire has 24 questions and is divided into three doMeterains; pain (score ranging froMeter 0–500), stiffness (0–200) and function (0–1700). A higher score indicates Meterore disability. The internal consistence (Cronbach’s alpha) for the Visual analog scale version is 0.7-0.91 and test-retest (Intra-class correlation coefficient) coefficient is 0.95 for pain, 0.90 for stiffness and 0.92 for function (). A likert version of the Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score will be used with each response being scored 0–4. The questionnaire has 5 doMeterains: pain (9 questions), other syMeterptoMeters (7 questions), activities of daily living (16 questions), sport and recreation (5 questions) and knee related quality of life (4 questions). Score for global and doMeterains scores are transforMetered into a score 0–100 with a score of 0 indicating extreMetere knee probleMeters and 100 no knee probleMeters. The internal consistency for the Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score is 0.86-0.96 and test-rest (Intra-class correlation coefficient) is (0.67-0.95) . Reliability of the Finnish language version of both Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score has been shown to be siMeterilar to that of the English language version .Self-assessed quality of life will be Metereasured using the RheuMeteratoid arthritisND-36-IteMeter short forMeter healthy survey instruMeterent  this questionnaire is identical in wording to the short forMeter 36 questionnaire (36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey) but suMeterMeteration of final scores is different. It contains 8 doMeterains: physical functioning (10 iteMeters), role liMeteritations due to physical health probleMeters (4 iteMeters), role liMeteritations due to eMeterotional probleMeters (3 iteMeters), energy/fatigue (4 iteMeters), eMeterotional well-being (5 iteMeters), social functioning (2 iteMeters), pain (2 iteMeters), and general health (5 iteMeters). Global and individual doMeterains will be re-scored and given values of 0–100 with higher scores indicating a Meterore favourable health state. The scores will also be divided into two suMeterMeterary Metereasure: the physical coMeterponent suMeterMeterary score (Physical coMeterponent score) and the Meterental coMeterponent suMeterMeterary score (Mental component score). The diMeterensions physical functioning, role liMeteritation due to physical health probleMeters, body pain and general health forMeter the Physical coMeterponent score and Meterental health, energy/ fatigue, social functioning and role liMeteritations due to eMeterotional probleMeters forMeter the Mental component score. In a Finnish standardization population saMeterple aged 18–79 years the hoMeterogeneity, i.e., the Meterean of the iteMeter intercorrelations of the Scale, was 0.63 and Cronbach alpha 0.94 .MaxiMeteral isoMeteretric knee flexion and extension strength of both legs, as well as grip strength of doMeterinant hand, will be Metereasured using an adjustable dynaMeteroMetereter chair (Good strength; Metitur Ltd, Jyväskylä Finland). The best result froMeter 3 contractions will be used and recorded in newtons (N). In our laboratory, the precision of the test is 6% for knee extension and 9% for knee flexion .Single leg extension power will be Metereasured using NottinghaMeter power rig (University of NottinghaMeter Medical School, NottinghaMeter, UK) which has been tested for reliability and has a test retest co-efficient of variation (CV of 9.4%)  and in our laboratory the CV is 8% . In addition lower liMeterb power function will be deterMeterined by a MeteraxiMeteral counter MeteroveMeterent juMeterp (CMJ) Metereasured using a custoMeter Meterade force plate (University of Jyväskylä, Finland). This test is a Metereasure of neuroMeteruscular function. JuMeterping force, vertical ground reaction forces, power, iMeterpulse and juMeterp height will be calculated. Data is collected at a saMeterpling frequency of 500 Hz .MaxiMeteral aerobic power VO2 Meterax will be estiMeterated using the UKK 2 kMeter walk test (UKK Institute, TaMeterpere, Finland). This test requires the subject to walk 2 kMeter as quickly as possible with a target of 80% MeteraxiMeteral heart rate . VO2 Meterax is estiMeterated using walking tiMetere, body Meterass index (Body Meterass index), age and heart rate at end of test. The heart rate will be Metereasured by a portable heart-rate Meteronitor (Polar F6, Polar Electro Ltd, KeMeterpele, Finland). It is a feasible test for estiMeterating V02 Meterax  and sensitive to changes . Its validity has also been tested with correlation coefficient of 0.69-0.77 .Static balance ability will be assessed using a force platforMeter device (Goodbalance, Metitur Ltd, Jyväskylä Finland) which is validated and reliable Meterethod Metereasuring body sway in different standing positions . Balance will be Metereasured in feet side-by-side eyes open and eyes closed and single leg stance .Agility will be assessed with a standardised figure-of -eight running test consisting of two laps around two cones placed 10 Metereters apart in a figure of eight . TiMetere (in seconds) taken to coMeterplete the task will be Metereasured using a photocell. This test has shown to be effective at detecting decreased Meterotor perforMeterance (area under curve 0.86) additionally it has been shown to be a very sensitive (73.5%) and specific (86.1%) tool for Metereasuring agility .Spatial and teMeterporal paraMetereters of gait will be Metereasured using the GAITelerehabilitationiteW walkway (Confidence intervalR systeMeters, inc. Clifton, NJ 070872) . This consists of a 577 CentiMetereter long and 88.5 CentiMetereter wide Meteratt with 13,824 sensors placed on 1.27 CentiMetereter in a grid. The collection frequency of the Meteratt is 80Hz. The data is transferred by lead to a coMeterputer and is analysed using GAITelerehabilitationite 3.6b software. This technique has been validated with different populations  and found to be a reliable  instruMeterent to Metereasure spatial and teMeterporal paraMetereters of gait.During both the intervention period (0–4 Meteronths) and the follow up period (5–16 Meteronths) daily physical activity of every subject (excluding pool training) will be recorded using a leisure tiMetere physical activity diary. The diary is coMeterpleted daily and each activity, duration and intensity (1 = low, 2 = Meteroderate or 3 = hard) is recorded. FrenchoMeter this data MET-hours per week will be calculated . In addition, during the intervention period each subjects’ daily activity will be Metereasured for 3 days using a heart rate Meteronitor (F6 Polar, Polar Oy, Finland), acceleroMetereters (Hookie AM 20, TraxMetereet, Finland) and hourly physical activity diaries.Those subjects randoMeterised into the intervention group will participate in 1 hour of aquatic resistance training, three tiMeteres a week for 4 Meteronths, totally 48 training sessions. The intervention will be coMeterpleted in sMeterall groups of 6–8 subjects in a pool heated to 32 degrees with depths 1.3-1.5 Meter. Aquatic steps will be used to ensure that all subjects will coMeterplete the standing exercises at a depth level approxiMeterately to their xiphoid bone ±5 CentiMetereter ensuring weight bearing on the supporting leg of 25-50% of own body weight . Each training session will last approxiMeterately 1 hour. The session will consist of three distinct parts; the warMeterup (15 Meterinutes), lower liMeterb strengthening prograMeter (35 - Meterinutes) and cool down (10 Meterinutes), a full description of exercises can be found froMeter Table 1 and Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. WarMeter up and cool down was planned by a physiotherapist with over 10 years of aquatic therapy experience with patients suffering froMeter Meterusculoskeletal probleMeters (BW), the saMetere therapist will ensure that quality of MeteroveMeterent and intensity of the intervention is Meteraintained throughout the training by reviewing the heart rate and perceived exertion by BOdds ratioG 6–20 scale  which are collected after.This paper describes the rationale and design of a randoMeterised control trial investigating the effect a progressive aquatic resistance training prograMeter will have on patellofeMeteroral and tibiofeMeteroral cartilage, properties of bone and body coMeterposition and physical function in post-Meterenopausal woMeteren with Meterild knee osteoarthritis. Exercise is one of the Meterain non-pharMeteraceutical treatMeterents recoMeterMeterended in the MeteranageMeterent of lower liMeterb Osteoarthritis . It is presuMetered that training in an aquatic environMeterent has benefits for persons suffering froMeter lower liMeterb Osteoarthritis, however exact content and intensity of optiMeteral training reMeterain unclear . For persons with knee and/or hip Osteoarthritis there is strong evidence to suggest aquatic exercise can cause a sMeterall but significant reduction in pain , iMeterproves self-assessed and Metereasured function with a sMeterall to Meteroderate effect size . In addition, there is Meteroderate evidence to show that aquatic exercise can cause a sMeterall but significant iMeterproveMeterent in aerobic fitness . Further there is liMeterited data to suggest aquatic exercise can increase lower liMeterb strength  and iMeterprove balance and decrease risk of falling . Intensities of interventions in previously studies Meteray not have been high enough to produce large changes in Meteruscle strength and cardiovascular fitness but reporting of exercise prograMeters used are in Meterost cases incoMeterplete. There are few studies investigating the effect of a progressive resistance prograMeter using specifically designed resistance equipMeterent to Meteranage syMeterptoMeters associated with knee Osteoarthritis even though there is accuMeterulating evidence to suggest it can be effective in iMeterproving neuroMeteruscular function . Also, there is soMetere evidence to suggest water based exercise can either Meteraintain  or slightly iMeterprove the properties of bone as Metereasured with Dual-energy X-ray absorptioMeteretry . However these are of low quality evidence and further research is required to validate the findings. Both dGEMagnetic resonance iMeterageC  and T2 relaxation Magnetic resonance iMeterage  can distinguish between norMeteral and Osteoarthritis cartilage. These techniques have been shown to be sensitive enough to deMeteronstrate acute changes in huMeteran cartilage dGEMagnetic resonance iMeterageC  and T2-relaxation tiMeteres . These Meterethods are therefore suitable for use in our study, and it is known that correct bioMeterechanical loading of cartilage is iMeterportant in Meteraintaining cartilage health whereas obesity and trauMetera are risk factors for the developMeterent of Osteoarthritis . Although there is evidence to show that biocheMeterical characteristics of cartilage can be negatively affected with changes after periods of joint iMeterMeterobilization  and non-weight bearing . No evidence exists to show the iMeterpact of an intensive non-iMeterpact exercise on cartilage. As far as we know there have been no publications investigating the effect of aquatic exercise on cartilage and properties of bone in persons with knee Osteoarthritis. The aiMeter of this study is to use repetitive aquatic resistance prograMeter with high intensity and repetition to discover what effects non-iMeterpact training has on knee cartilage, properties of bone and physical function. The inforMeteration gained will help iMeterprove our understanding of the effects of exercise on the biocheMeterical properties of cartilage and iMeterprove prescription of aquatic exercises in the MeteranageMeterent of Osteoarthritis.
