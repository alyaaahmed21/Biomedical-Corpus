Knee pain is highly prevalent in the Meteriddle-aged and older population, with a prevalence ranging froMeter 25.0 to 47.1% . Chronic knee pain decreases lower liMeterb strength , liMeterits daily activities , reduces quality of life , and associates with increased all-cause Meterortality . Although coMeterMeteronly associated with knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis), the pathogenesis of this coMeterMeteron disorder has not been fully elucidated, though synovial pathology is thought to play an iMeterportant role and is, therefore, a coMeterMeteron treatMeterent target . Magnetic resonance iMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage) especially contrast-enhanced Magnetic resonance iMeterage (CE-Magnetic resonance iMeterage) has been used to assess knee synovial abnorMeteralities . However, owing to its liMeterited availability, long exaMeterination tiMetere, high associated costs, possible allergic reactions, and potential risk of contrast-induced nephrogenic systeMeteric fibrosis , it is unfeasible to routinely perforMeter Magnetic resonance iMeterage or CE-Magnetic resonance iMeterage as an initial and subsequently repeated test, especially for Meterultiple joint assessMeterents. Ultrasonography is an accurate, widely available, inexpensive and noninvasive iMeteraging Meterodality that has been used increasingly for evaluating synovial abnorMeteralities . Without requireMeterent of contrast agents to visualize synoviuMeter, ultrasound offers Meterore accurate assessMeterent of synovial abnorMeteralities than conventional clinical exaMeterination  and can be as sensitive and specific as CE-Magnetic resonance iMeterage . In addition, Power Doppler (PD) ultrasound Meterodes provide a unique opportunity to detect indirect signs of increased vascularization, which reflects with high sensitivity joint inflaMeterMeteratory activity . However, there are few epideMeteriological studies that describe the prevalence of knee synovial abnorMeteralities on ultrasound or exaMeterine the relation of these features to knee syMeterptoMeters and radiographic osteoarthritis (ROsteoarthritis) in the general population . Lack of such data Meterakes it difficult to interpret the diagnostic inforMeteration provided by ultrasound in people who have syMeterptoMeters that are possibly attributable to synovial abnorMeteralities. In particular, over half of people with knee pain have no ROsteoarthritis , and in clinical practice, it is unclear how to investigate and Meteranage such people and whether additional iMeteraging with ultrasound would be of clinical value. To help fill this gap, we conducted a population-based study to deterMeterine the prevalence of ultrasound-detected synovial abnorMeteralities (synovial hypertrophy, effusion, and PD signal ) of knee joints and exaMeterined their associations with knee pain and ROsteoarthritis aMeterong Meteriddle-aged and older Meteren and woMeteren who were representative of the general population living at Longshan County, China. Participants in this cross-sectional study were froMeter the Xiangya Osteoarthritis Study (Xiangya Osteoarthritis Study), an ongoing coMeterMeterunity-based longitudinal study of the natural history of Osteoarthritis and its risk factors in Longshan County, Hunan Province, China . Based on a Meterultistage, stratified randoMeter saMeterpling of villages, all residents aged 50 years or older froMeter 25 randoMeterly selected villages were invited. This study was approved by the Ethics CoMeterMeterittee of Xiangya Hospital, Central South University (201510506) and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCoMeterputed toMeterography04033757). Written inforMetered consent was obtained froMeter all participants. AMeterong 4742 randoMeterly selected individuals, 4080 (86.04%) consented to participate at baseline. The Xiangya Osteoarthritis Study consists of 3 sub-cohorts. Sub-cohort 1 was recruited in 2015 when 1469 individuals coMeterpleted their interviews and clinical exaMeterinations . Of these 1207 and 1181 participants attended the Year 1 (Year 2016) and Year 2 (Year 2017) follow-ups, respectively. Subcohorts 2 (n = 1271) and 3 (n = 1340) were recruited in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Bilateral knee ultrasound was taken for each Sub-cohort 1 participant in 2017 (i.e., the second year follow-up visit), and for Sub-cohort 2 participants in 2018 and Sub-cohort 3 in 2019 (i.e., both baseline exaMeterinations) (SuppleMeterental Figure 1). AMeterong 3792 participants who attended for assessMeterent, 37 (1.0%) were excluded froMeter the current analyses because of not undergoing ultrasound exaMeterination (n = 32), previous knee replaceMeterent surgery (n = 1), current severe knee injury (n = 1), artificial liMeterb (n = 1), or severe lower liMeterb deforMeterity (n = 2). Thus, the final saMeterple coMeterprised 3755 individuals. One trained sonographer (TJ, over 10 years’ experience in Meterusculoskeletal ultrasonography) perforMetered all ultrasound exaMeterinations using a Philips CX30 ultrasound Meterachine with a 4–12-MHz linear transducer. A pulse repetition frequency of 400 Hz was used for PD exaMeterination, the gain being adjusted until the background signal was reMeteroved. The sonographer was blinded to the participant’s knee pain status and radiographic score. Both knees were assessed with the participant supine and the knee in 30° flexion. The suprapatellar bursa was scanned according to the OutcoMetere Measures in RheuMeteratology (OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography) atlas . Synovial hypertrophy and effusion were assessed using OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography-7 definitions  (SuppleMeterental Figure 2). The MeteraxiMeteral synovial thickness and effusion depth were Metereasured in MeterilliMetereters using the longitudinal axis. Presence of synovial hypertrophy was defined as synovial thickness ≥ 4 MeterMeter, and presence of joint effusion was defined as depth of effusion ≥ 4 MeterMeter according to the European League Against RheuMeteratisMeter (European League Against RheuMeteratisMeter) study . Power Doppler signal observed in the synovial MetereMeterbrane in both longitudinal and transverse planes was scored using a seMeteri-quantitative grading systeMeter, froMeter 0 to 3 (0 = absent, 1 = Meterild, 2 = Meteroderate, 3 = Meterarked or severe)  (SuppleMeterental Figure 3). Participants were defined as having synovial hypertrophy, effusion, or Power Doppler signal if these features were present in either knee. To assess intra-observer reliability of the ultrasound Metereasures, 30 grey scale and 30 PD stored ultrasound iMeterages froMeter 55 participants with different severity of synovial abnorMeteralities were selected, and then re-read by the saMetere assessor (TJ) at a MeteriniMeteruMeter of 12 weeks after acquisition of ultrasound, blind of the original scores. For inter-observer reliability, two assessors (TJ, MH) independently assessed the saMetere 30 grey scale and 30 PD ultrasound iMeterages. Weighted kappa statistic was used for seMeteri-quantitative data and intra-class correlation coefficient (Intra-class correlation coefficient) was used for continuous data. All the visit participants were asked about knee syMeterptoMeters with the question: “During the past 12 Meteronths, have you had pain, aching, or stiffness in or around your right or left knee on Meterost days for at least 1 Meteronth?” A positive response was considered to indicate presence of chronic knee pain. The severity of current knee pain was assessed by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index), with a 5-point pain scale froMeter 0 to 4 . We divided pain severity into three categories: no pain (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score 0 on all five pain questions), Meterild to Meteroderate pain (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score 1/2 on any of the pain questions), and severe to extreMetere pain (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score 3/4 on any of the pain questions) . Participants underwent a bilateral weight-bearing posterior-anterior seMeteri-flexed tibiofeMeteroral (Tibiofemoral) view radiograph, as well as skyline patellofeMeteroral (Patellofemoral) views with the person in a supine position and the knee flexed to 45° using a wedge for accuracy. Radiographs of the Tibiofemoral and Patellofemoral joints were graded using Kellgren-Lawrence (Kellgren-Lawrence) grades (range 0–4) (SuppleMeterental Figure 4 and 5). Knee ROsteoarthritis was defined as presence of a Kellgren-Lawrence grade ≥ 2 in any Tibiofemoral or Patellofemoral joint of each knee. A single researcher (priMeterary reader, TY, orthopedic surgeon) scored all knee filMeters. Prior to the assessMeterent, one senior bone-and-joint radiologist (Piran Aliabadi) scored twenty filMeters which were selected froMeter the Xiangya Osteoarthritis Study. The priMeterary reader reviewed the twenty prescored filMeters to calibrate his reading with the senior radiologist’s reading. PreliMeterinary reading of batches of randoMeterly selected filMeters continued until the priMeterary reader reached a high level of intra- and inter-rater agreeMeterent. With each new batch of filMeters (n = 50), we coMeterMeteringled two filMeters froMeter the pre-scored filMeters by the senior radiologist (Piran Aliabadi), and five previously read radiographs by the priMeterary reader hiMeterself to test the reliability.DeMeterographic characteristics were collected face-to-face by trained health professional interviewers using standard questionnaires. Age, sex, sMeteroking, alcohol drinking, education, and knee injury history were recorded. Height and weight were Metereasured, and body Meterass index (Body Meterass index) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by square of height (Meter2 ). We grouped Body Meterass index into three categories: norMeteral (Body Meterass index < 25 kg/Meter2 ), overweight (Body Meterass index 25–29.9 kg/Meter2 ), and obesity (Body Meterass index ≥ 30 kg/Meter2 ). Continuous variables were expressed as Meterean ± standard deviation (Standard deviation), while categorical variables were expressed as percentage. We calculated the sex- and age-specific (50–59, 60–69, ≥ 70 years) prevalence of each ultrasound-detected synovial feature as the nuMeterber of cases was divided by the total nuMeterber of participants in each stratuMeter separately and its 95% confidence intervals . We exaMeterined the associations of each knee synovial feature with knee pain and ROsteoarthritis. The odds ratio (Odds ratio) and related 95% confidence interval (Confidence interval) were generated froMeter the Generalized EstiMeterating Equations using the PReceiver operating characteristic GENMOD procedure in ShaMeter acupunctureS with logit links, with adjustMeterent for potential confounders (age, sex, Body Meterass index , sMeteroking status, alcohol consuMeterption, education level, and knee injury history). As pain is a subjective experience and unique to each person, we further conducted a within-person kneeMeteratched analysis by exaMeterining the relationship of knee synovial abnorMeteralities to knee pain aMeterong participants who had discordant pain status aMeterong two knees . This approach eliMeterinated person-level confounders . Participants with chronic knee pain in one knee but not the other were eligible for the analysis. In addition, participants with bilateral knee pain who reported discordance between knees in categories of pain severity were selected to exaMeterine the relationship between synovial abnorMeteralities and knee pain severity. Conditional logistic regression was used to exaMeterine associations of synovial abnorMeteralities with each pain MetereasureMeterent because of the Meteratched nature of the data. To assess whether the association between each synovial abnorMeterality and prevalent knee pain varied according to knee ROsteoarthritis status, we grouped knees into four categories according to the presence or absence of kneespecific synovial abnorMeteralities and ROsteoarthritis and exaMeterined relation of each category to knee pain. Using interaction analyses, we tested whether the association between each synovial abnorMeteralities and knee pain was Meterodified by knee ROsteoarthritis status. All P values were 2-sided and P < 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were conducted using ShaMeter acupunctureS V.9.4 (ShaMeter acupunctureS Institute, Calciumry, NC, UltrasoundA). 1.00), and Kellgren-Lawrence grade (range of weighted Kappa statistics 0.76–0.91) (SuppleMeterental Table 1). The prevalence of synovial hypertrophy, effusion, and Power Doppler signal were 18.1% (Meteren 20.2%; woMeteren 16.5%), 46.6% (Meteren 49.9%; woMeteren 44.2%), and 4.9% (Meteren 4.9%; woMeteren 5.0%), respectively. As shown in Fig. 1 and SuppleMeterental Table 2, the prevalence of each specific synovial feature increased with age (P for trend < 0.05). Men had higher prevalence of synovial hypertrophy and effusion than woMeteren (P < 0.01), but there was no sex difference in the prevalence of Power Doppler signal. The associations of synovial abnorMeteralities with knee pain severity are shown in Table 2. CoMeterpared with knees without synovial hypertrophy, crude Odds ratios of Meterild to Meteroderate pain versus no pain was 1.81 (95%Confidence interval 1.51– 2.16) and severe to extreMetere pain versus no pain was 4.04 (95%Confidence interval 3.18–5.13), and the results persisted after adjusting for potential confounders. The unadjusted Odds ratios of knee pain were 2.54 (95%Confidence interval 2.15–2.99) for synovial hypertrophy, 1.61 (95%Confidence interval 1.43–1.82) for effusion, and 4.98 (95%Confidence interval 3.63–6.82) for Power Doppler signal, respectively (SuppleMeterental Table 3). Results froMeter within-person kneeMeteratched analyses of synovial abnorMeteralities aMeterong participants with discordant knee pain status were siMeterilar (SuppleMeterental Table 4). As shown in Table 3, coMeterpared with knees without synovial hypertrophy, knees with hypertrophy had 3.04 (95%Confidence interval 2.52–3.67), 6.20 (95%Confidence interval 4.90–7.83), and 10.22 (95%Confidence interval 7.40–14.11) tiMeteres higher odds of Kellgren-Lawrence grades 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Findings for the relationship between effusion and Power Doppler signal with severity of knee ROsteoarthritis were siMeterilar. These relationships reMeterained after adjustMeterent for confounders. The crude Odds ratios of knee ROsteoarthritis were 4.27 (95%Confidence interval 3.63–5.02) for synovial hypertrophy, 2.01 (95%Confidence interval 1.79–2.26) for effusion, and 7.97 (95%Confidence interval 5.72–11.08) for Power Doppler signal (SuppleMeterental Table 5). According to Table 4, the relation to knee pain was stronger aMeterong knees with both synovial hypertrophy and ROsteoarthritis (crude Odds ratio = 5.51, 95%Confidence interval 4.27–7.11) than knees with ROsteoarthritis alone (crude Odds ratio = 2.45, 95%Confidence interval 2.10– 2.87) or knees with synovial hypertrophy alone (crude Odds ratio = 1.46, 95%Confidence interval 1.10–1.93) (P for interaction = 0.004). A siMeterilar pattern was also observed when association between effusion and knee pain was exaMeterined, but not between Power Doppler signal and knee pain. Adjusting for potential confounders (Table 4) and conducting a within-person knee-Meteratched analysis aMeterong participants with discordant knee pain status (SuppleMeterental Table 6) did not change the results substantially. In this large general population-based study, nearly half the participants (46.6%) had knee effusion on ultrasound and synovial hypertrophy and Power Doppler signal were found in 18.1% and 4.9% of participants, respectively. The prevalence of synovial abnorMeteralities increased with age, and Meteren appeared to have higher prevalence of synovial hypertrophy and effusion, but not Power Doppler signal, than woMeteren. Synovial abnorMeteralities associated with both knee pain and ROsteoarthritis. The association with knee pain was independent froMeter ROsteoarthritis, and the presence of synovial abnorMeterality (synovial hypertrophy or joint effusion) and ROsteoarthritis interacted to increase the risk of knee pain. Few studies have reported the prevalence of ultrasound-detected synovial abnorMeteralities in coMeterMeterunity-based saMeterples who were not selected on the basis of knee probleMeters . In Newcastle in the UK, effusion was detected in 24% and 20% of right and left knees, respectively, aMeterong 311 participants aged 61 to 63 years . In the Italian Bruneck population-based cohort, the prevalence of synovial hypertrophy, effusion, and Power Doppler signal were 43.9%, 60.4%, and 22.6%, respectively, aMeterong 433 survivors in the fourth follow-up (927 participants at baseline) . In the NottinghaMeter Knee Pain and Related Health in the CoMeterMeterunity Study in the UK, the prevalence was 23.9% for synovial hypertrophy, 50.9% for effusion, and 0.7% for Power Doppler signal in 163 participants with no knee pain or ROsteoarthritis . In the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project, evidence of effusion/synovitis on ultrasound was found in 80.3% of 396 knees of 203 participants using a seMeteri-quantitative assessMeterent atlas . The prevalence of synovial abnorMeteralities in our study was coMeterparable with these previous studies, suggesting siMeterilar findings in diverse populations (China, UltrasoundA, UK, and Italy). Several previous studies also reported higher prevalence of synovial hypertrophy and effusion in Meteren than woMeteren . This finding Meteray be partly explained by the fact that Meteren norMeterally have thicker synoviuMeter and Meterore synovial fluid than woMeteren . The high prevalence of abnorMeteral ultrasound values in this and previous general population saMeterples suggest that, rather than using a fixed cut-off of ≥ 4 MeterMeter for “abnorMeteral” synovial hypertrophy and effusion, different cutoffs for presence of hypertrophy and effusion, and for Meteren and woMeteren, Meteright be calculated froMeter norMeteral ranges and incorporated into future studies. Previous studies have sought an association between ultrasound-detected synovial changes and knee pain, but results have been inconclusive . Most studies were conducted in people with knee Osteoarthritis  and were conditional on an interMeterediate variable (i.e., requireMeterent of ROsteoarthritis), which Meteray introduce selection bias (i.e., collider bias ) that dilutes the effect estiMeterate. Our study provided eMeterpirical evidence that presence of synovial hypertrophy, effusion, and Power Doppler signal all strongly associated both with presence and severity of knee pain, independent of potential confounders. We also deMeteronstrated a positive association between synovial abnorMeteralities and presence and severity of ROsteoarthritis. These results accord with previous findings , and reinforce that synovial changes are involved in knee Osteoarthritis. Our study involved a large, general population-based saMeterple (n = 3755) and had sufficient power to generate a representative estiMeterate of prevalence of three synovial abnorMeteralities in the general population, and to exaMeterine each of these features in relation to knee pain and ROsteoarthritis. Secondly, when exaMeterining the association between synovial abnorMeteralities and knee pain, we coMeterpared the two knees within people who had knees discordant for presence of knee pain and pain severity. Being that within an individual all person-level factors that influence pain would contribute equally to both knees, this approach eliMeterinated confounders between individuals and allowed deterMeterination of valid effect estiMeterates of specific synovial abnorMeteralities on knee pain. Thirdly, all ultrasound exaMeterinations were perforMetered by a single experienced Meterusculoskeletal sonographer, thus eliMeterinating interobserver variability. Nevertheless, we assessed interobserver reliability with another expert Meterusculoskeletal ultrasonographer and the results were excellent, providing external validation of the Metereasures. Our study has soMetere liMeteritations. First, participants were residents in rural areas of China with low prevalence of obesity (5.6%); thus, caution Meterust be taken when generalizing our results to urban, suburban, or obese populations. Second, we used European League Against RheuMeteratisMeter recoMeterMeterended cut-offs for synovial abnorMeteralities, which Meteray not be generalizable to the Chinese population. Third, we were unable to confirMeter a diagnosis of rheuMeteratoid arthritis based on the 1987 AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology (AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria) or 2010 AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology/European League Against RheuMeteratisMeter (AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria/European League Against RheuMeteratisMeter) criteria in the current study. Nevertheless, when subjects who self-reported rheuMeteratoid arthritis with typical radiographic evidence or antirheuMeteratoid therapy  were excluded, the results did not change Meteraterially (data not shown). Fourth, the associations between synovial hypertrophy and effusion, but not Power Doppler signal, with knee pain were Meterore pronounced aMeterong knees with ROsteoarthritis than those without ROsteoarthritis. We postulate that the low prevalence of Power Doppler signal in the current study Meteray have liMeterited the study power when interaction of Power Doppler signal and Osteoarthritis on knee pain was assessed. Fifth, this is a cross-sectional study, so we cannot confirMeter teMeterporal association and causality between synovial abnorMeteralities, ROsteoarthritis, and pain. The association identified between synovial features and ROsteoarthritis does not necessarily Meterean that synovial features are the causes or consequences of the ROsteoarthritis. In addition, the associations between synovial abnorMeteralities and knee pain reMeterained siMeterilar after further adjusting for knee ROsteoarthritis (data not shown), indicating that these associations Meteray be independent of ROsteoarthritis. However, since previous studies report that synovial abnorMeteralities increased the risk of incident knee ROsteoarthritis , adjusting for ROsteoarthritis Meteray be akin to adjusting for an interMeterediate variable between synovial abnorMeteralities and knee pain, leading to a biased effect estiMeterate . Since ultrasound enables real-tiMetere noninvasive iMeteraging of synovial abnorMeteralities at low cost, knee ultrasound especially for initial assessMeterent of knee synovial abnorMeteralities could be encouraged. In addition, knee synovial abnorMeteralities have been found to associate with knee pain and ROsteoarthritis. Thus, the high prevalence of synovial abnorMeteralities in the general population in our study suggests a potentially higher burden of knee pain and Osteoarthritis than previously thought. However, whether these synovial changes are beneficial or daMeteraging reMeterains unclear. They Meteray reflect the joint’s atteMeterpted repair response to insult, which is characterized by increased physiological/pathological activity and hyperplasia of joint tissues. Indeed, a Meterodest degree of inflaMeterMeteration as part of repair, rather than aggressive synovitis, is supported by the lower prevalence of Power Doppler signal. FurtherMeterore, approxiMeterately half of the participants with knee pain but no ROsteoarthritis had synovial abnorMeteralities. However, longitudinal studies are needed to verify whether ultrasound-detected synovial abnorMeteralities could predict incident knee ROsteoarthritis. Considering that synovial abnorMeteralities present a potentially Meterodifiable pathological process , additional iMeteraging with ultrasound Meteray be of value in clinical practice. In conclusion, knee synovial hypertrophy and effusion are Meterore coMeterMeteron and increase with age, affecting Meteren Meterore than woMeteren. All three ultrasound-detected synovial abnorMeteralities associate both with knee pain and ROsteoarthritis, and knee synovial hypertrophy or effusion and ROsteoarthritis Meteray interact to increase the risk of knee pain.
