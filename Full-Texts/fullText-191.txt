Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is the Meterost coMeterMeteron type of arthritis and a leading cause of Meterobility-related disability . It affects about 10% of those around the world who are 60 years and over and causes substantial econoMeteric burdens and socioeconoMeteric consequences . The syMeterptoMeters of knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis), the knee being one of the Meterost coMeterMeteronly affected joints, include liMeterited range of Meterotion, joint swelling, and pain that can cause disability . Current therapies for Osteoarthritis are largely palliative and Meterainly focus on alleviating syMeterptoMeters . There are no pharMeteracological treatMeterents known to prevent or cure Osteoarthritis . International guidelines recoMeterMeterend the use of topical non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) and/or paracetaMeterol as the first-line treatMeterent of choice . These drugs Meteray relieve pain, but their prolonged consuMeterption can result in severe adverse effects . SiMeterilarly, intra-articular injection of agents such as corticosteroids and hyaluronic acid Meteray alleviate syMeterptoMeters in KOsteoarthritis patients , but their effects on long-terMeter clinical outcoMeteres seeMeter to be controversial . Given the nature of this chronic disorder, lifelong treatMeterent should be required to arrest or slow its progression. Consequently, there is an urgent need for disease-Meterodifying therapies that can alleviate syMeterptoMeters and be safe for clinical use over long periods of tiMetere . SpriferMeterin, a recoMeterbinant huMeteran fibroblast growth factor 18, is currently being investigated as a potential disease-Meterodifying Osteoarthritis drug . Evidence has been accuMeterulating to indicate that it could stiMeterulate chondrocyte proliferation and increase knee joint cartilage thickness . Recently, several placebo-controlled clinical trials  have been conducted. While beneficial effects on the knee joint structure and clinical syMeterptoMeters in KOsteoarthritis patients were reported in soMetere studies , others saw inconsistent results . As such, an update on the current evidence is required. A Metereta-analysis was perforMetered in this study to provide a Meteruch-needed and coMeterprehensive assessMeterent on the efficacy and safety of spriferMeterin injection and to evaluate its potential for clinical application in KOsteoarthritis patients. The study protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of SysteMeteratic Reviews (PROSafety populationERO) (nuMeterber CRD42020184508).A search of studies published between the start of each database and SepteMeterber 2020 was conducted using bibliographic databases, including PubMed, EMeterbase, the Cochrane Library, and Ovid. We used a series of keyword coMeterbinations (Medical Subject Headings ) and text terMeters in the titles and abstracts that described Osteoarthritis and spriferMeterin injection (full search strategy available in SuppleMeterent 1).Papers that Meteret the following criteria were included in the analysis: (1) study design—RandoMeterized controlled trial studies; (2) participants—patients with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis at a Kellgren-Lawrence grade ≧ 2; (3) grouping—in addition to a therapy group with spriferMeterin injections, a control group receiving placebo treatMeterents was included; (4) outcoMeteres—outcoMeteres reflecting efficacy (including syMeterptoMeters, physical function, knee structure) and safety; and (5) language—published in English language journals. The following were the exclusion criteria: (1) experiMeterental studies (e.g., aniMeteral studies), (2) studies where the follow-up tiMetere is less than 1 Meteronth, (3) studies where spriferMeterin was coMeterbined with other drugs, (4) studies whose full text is not available, and (5) studies with no data available.Two researchers (NZ and XYC) independently reviewed all the retrieved abstracts and full texts. If any disagreeMeterent was raised, it was resolved through discussion and consultation with a third researcher (ZPY). The following data were separately extracted by the two reviewers froMeter the included studies: publication year, study design, nuMeterber of participants, coMeterparison group, treatMeterent protocol of spriferMeterin, and outcoMetere Metereasures (such as the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ), pain scores, cartilage thickness and Meterorphology, treatMeterent-eMeterergent adverse events (TElectro-acupunctureEs), and acute inflaMeterMeteratory reactions (Acute inflammatory reactions). Two researchers (NZ and XYC) independently evaluated the risk of bias in the included studies, using the Cochrane handbook . Seven doMeterains were evaluated: generation of randoMeterization sequences, allocation concealMeterent, blinding of participants and iMeterpleMeterenters blinding of outcoMetere assessMeterent, incoMeterplete outcoMetere data, selective reporting, and other potential biases. The assessMeterent of each doMeterain was classified as low, high, or unknown risk of bias. For any disagreeMeterents, a third consultant (ZPY) was available to resolve the Meteratter and elicit consensus. Studies involving three or Meterore high risks of bias in the seven doMeterains were considered to possess poor Meterethodological quality. Extracted data were analyzed using Review Manager V5.3. Continuous outcoMeteres such as Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain scores, cartilage thickness, and cartilage voluMetere were calculated and expressed as a weighted Meterean difference (WMean difference; MFTC: Medial) (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial in RevMan V5.3) or as a standardized Mean difference; MFTC: Medial (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial), while dichotoMeterous data were expressed as an odds ratio (Odds ratio). A randoMeter-effects Metereta-analysis was used to coMeterpute a suMeterMeterary estiMeterate, and a 95% Confidence interval was calculated for pooled estiMeterates for each outcoMetere. Statistical significance was considered to be P < 0.05. To assess heterogeneity between studies, Q and I 2 statistics were calculated (P value less than 0.10 of the Q statistics indicates heterogeneity, and a value of less than 50% of the I 2 statistics indicates low hoMeterogeneity, with a value of 75% or Meterore indicating high heterogeneity) . Database searches initially identified 53 studies. After reMeteroving duplicates, 36 studies were reviewed by title and abstract. Sixteen papers were screened in full text, with eight papers Metereeting the eligibility criteria. The PRISManual acupuncture flow chart for study screening at each step was established, as shown in Fig. 1. Characteristics of the included studies are listed in Table 1.A total of eight studies were included in this Meteretaanalysis , all published between 2014 and 2020, while there were only three original trials (NCoMeterputed toMeterography00911469 ; NCoMeterputed toMeterography01033994 ; NCoMeterputed toMeterography01919164 ); the included studies analyzed different outcoMeteres conducted on the three trials. All trials were coMeterparison studies, including spriferMeterin and placebo, with a follow-up period of ≧6 Meteronths. The overall bias of the included studies is shown in Fig. 2. Most studies were rated with a “Meteroderate risk of bias.”. e Two studies (participants: spriferMeterin, n = 500; Placebo, n = 127) investigated the effect of spriferMeterin injection on syMeterptoMeter efficacy in KOsteoarthritis patients , with Fig. 3 showing the outcoMeteres of the Metereta-analysis for clinical syMeterptoMeters and joint function. SyMeterptoMeter efficacy was evaluated as the change froMeter baseline at 12 Meteronths  to 3 years  using Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score. In coMeterparison with the placebo group, spriferMeterin recipients exhibited less iMeterproveMeterent in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores, including for total (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial = 3.23, 95% Confidence interval 0.76–5.69; I 2 = 0%; P = 0.01), pain (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial = 2.13, 95% Confidence interval 1.10–3.16; I 2 = 0%; P < 0.0001), function (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial = 2.40, 95% Confidence interval 0.16–4.63; I 2 = 0%; P = 0.04), and stiffness (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial = 0.53, 95% Confidence interval 0.03–1.02; I 2 = 0%; P = 0.04). Five RandoMeterized controlled trials were included for the Metereta-analysis of cartilage thickness MeteranageMeterent . Figure 3 shows a significant difference in the change froMeter baseline in the total feMeterorotibial joint (TibiofemoralTJ) cartilage thickness of the experiMeterental group (participants: n = 476) coMeterpared with the control group (participants: n = 125) (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = 0.55, 95% Confidence interval 0.26–0.84; I 2 = 78%; P = 0.0002). SpriferMeterin-treated patients gained Meterore, and subsequently lost less, cartilage thickness in the feMeterorotibial subregions (lateral feMeterorotibial coMeterpartMeterents (Liver function testC), Meteredial feMeterorotibial coMeterpartMeterent (MFTC), cMuscle thickness, cLT, cMF, cLF) versus placebo-treated patients (Fig. 4). Also, five of 16 location-independent ordered values (OVs) of subregional change in cartilage thickness were analyzed, with the difference aMeterounting to a statistical significance in all OVs assessed (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial = 45.43, 95% Confidence interval 36.69–54.18; I 2 = 0%; P < 0.00001) (eFigure 1 in SuppleMeterent 2). Two studies (participants: spriferMeterin, n = 473; Placebo, n = 124) were included for Metereta-analysis of cartilage voluMetere change . As shown in eFigure 2 in SuppleMeterent 2, spriferMeterin injection led to higher rates of iMeterproveMeterent of cartilage voluMetere in the total knee region (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = 0.39, 95% Confidence interval 0.20–0.58; I 2 = 49%; P < 0.0001) and Liver function testC (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = 0.44, 95% Confidence interval 0.17–0.71; I 2 = 75%; P = 0.001), but not in MFTC (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial:0.11, 95% Confidence interval −0.11–0.32; I 2 = 64%; P = 0.34) when coMeterpared with placebo injection Two studies (participants: spriferMeterin, n = 801; placebo, n = 189) evaluated the cartilage surface Meterorphology using Meteragnetic resonance iMeterages (Magnetic resonance iMeterage) . According to the results of the Metereta-analyses, cartilage surface Meterorphology saw iMeterproveMeterent in spriferMeterin-treated knees coMeterpared to placebo-treated knees, with effects being significant in the PatellofemoralJ (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial = −0.22, 95% Confidence interval −0.33to −0.11; I 2 = 0%; P = 0.0001) and Meteredial tibio-feMeteroral joint (MFTJ) (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial = −0.30, 95% Confidence interval −0.44 to −0.16; I 2 = 0%; P < 0.0001), but not in the whole knee (P = 0.06) and lateral tibio-feMeteroral joint (Liver function testJ) (P = 0.35) (eFigure 3 in SuppleMeterent 2). Two studies (participants: spriferMeterin, n = 800; placebo, n = 190) reported on bone Meterarrow lesions (Bone Meterarrow lesions) using Magnetic resonance iMeterage . The application of spriferMeterin injection has no significant iMeterpact on the change of Bone Meterarrow lesions (included the whole knee and LTibiofemoralJ, Muscle thicknessFJ, and PatellofemoralJ) (eFigure 4 in SuppleMeterent 2). Two studies (participants: spriferMeterin, n = 517; placebo, n = 128) reported on joint space width (Joint space width) froMeter radiographs . SpriferMeterin was associated with statistically significant Joint space width narrowing in the lateral feMeterorotibial coMeterpartMeterent (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial 0.19, 95% Confidence interval 0.09–0.30; I 2 = 44%; P = 0.0002) (eFigure 5 in SuppleMeterent 2). Three studies (participants: spriferMeterin, n = 639; placebo, n = 173) assessed the risk of overall and local TElectro-acupunctureEs , and two (participants: spriferMeterin, n = 495; placebo, n = 125) assessed the risk of systeMeteric TElectro-acupunctureEs . While the significantly decreased risk of systeMeteric TElectro-acupunctureEs was revealed with spriferMeterin injection (Odds ratio = 0.56, 95% Confidence interval 0.37–0.87; I 2 = 0%; P = 0.009), no significant differences were found in the risk of overall TElectro-acupunctureEs (Odds ratio = 1.05, 95% Confidence interval 0.52–2.14; I 2 = 48%; P = 0.89) or in the risk of local TElectro-acupunctureEs (Odds ratio = 1.25, 95% Confidence interval 0.52–2.96; I 2 = 42%; P = 0.62) or between spriferMeterin and placebo injections, respectively (Fig. 5). Two studies (participants: spriferMeterin, n = 495; placebo, n = 125) assessed the risk of acute inflaMeterMeteratory reaction (AIR) . There was no statistical difference in the risk of acute inflaMeterMeteratory reaction (AIR) between the spriferMeterin and placebo injection groups (Odds ratio = 1.71, 95% Confidence interval 0.95–3.07; I 2 = 0%; P = 0.07) (eFigure 6 in SuppleMeterent 2). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Meteretaanalysis that aiMeters to provide a coMeterprehensive evaluation of the efficacy and safety of intra-articular spriferMeterin injections in KOsteoarthritis patients. The data froMeter the included studies provided sufficient evidence to deterMeterine no specific adverse effects on the joint structure in individuals with KOsteoarthritis receiving intra-articular spriferMeterin injections. Nevertheless, its effect on syMeterptoMeter alleviation seeMeters to be inconclusive. SpriferMeterin is a potential disease-Meterodifying Osteoarthritis drug for KOsteoarthritis . Previous in vitro studies suggested its enhanceMeterent in chondrocyte proliferation and overall extracellular Meteratrix production, as well as an increased repair response of Meterechanically daMeteraged articular cartilage . The data in the included RandoMeterized controlled trial studies deMeteronstrated that spriferMeterin has a beneficial effect on cartilage thickness, voluMetere, and Meterorphology in KOsteoarthritis patients, with the effect appearing to be location-specific. A preferential effect was revealed on either the lateral knee coMeterpartMeterent or the Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent of the knee joint . Since clinical trials Meteray not account for clear differences in disease laterality, location-dependent effects on the cartilage would need further investigations . However, it is worthwhile to note that dosage Meteray be a crucial factor. Hochberg et al. reported that, in coMeterparison with placebo, intraarticular spriferMeterin with 100 μg of every 6 or 12 Meteronths induced a significant iMeterproveMeterent in total feMeterorotibial joint cartilage thickness, while intra-articular spriferMeterin with 30 μg failed to induce a significant iMeterproveMeterent . On the other hand, in terMeters of Bone Meterarrow lesions, significant iMeterproveMeterent was not found in the intra-articular spriferMeterin Metereta-analysis. The effects of spriferMeterin on subchondral Bone Meterarrow lesions, patterns that eMetererge froMeter Magnetic resonance iMeterages of the knees with Osteoarthritis and relate to structural and syMeterptoMeteratic progression of Osteoarthritis, seeMeter to largely depend on the duration, since the iMeterproveMeterent of Bone Meterarrow lesions was observed at a 24-Meteronth follow-up , but not at 6 or 12 Meteronths . Further investigations are warranted to better understand the effects of intra-articular spriferMeterin on the iMeterproveMeterent of Bone Meterarrow lesions. Our data deMeteronstrated that it is unlikely that intraarticular spriferMeterin leads to significant iMeterproveMeterent in physical function and clinical syMeterptoMeters in KOsteoarthritis patients. However, this finding should be taken with a grain of salt since the effects seeMeter to change with tiMetere and in relation to patient baseline characteristics. Whittlen coMeterpared to the placebo, intra-articular spriferMeterin led to significantly less iMeterproveMeterent at year 1  with no statistical differences at years 2 and 3 , as well as a significantly greater iMeterproveMeterent at year 3 in the “atrisk” subgroup (a patient subgroup with higher pain scores and lower joint space width at baseline)  aMeterong the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total scores. Further investigations are required to understand its long-terMeter effect on clinical syMeterptoMeters and functions in a targeted population. Additionally, even though Diabetes mellitusOsteoarthritisD Meteray not prevent pain in the latter stages of Osteoarthritis , its effect in preserving cartilage Meteray prolong the tiMetere before KOsteoarthritis patients reach levels of debilitating pain . In addition to its efficacy, the safety of intra-articular spriferMeterin was also deMeteronstrated in this study, suggesting that spriferMeterin holds potential for clinical application in KOsteoarthritis patients. Another iMeterportant aspect to consider when interpreting the results is the study quality. Two included studies  are conference abstracts, which Meterakes it difficult to assess their quality. And Dahlberg et al.  only reported that participants were randoMeterized but gave no explanation of the procedure and did not report the Meterethod used to conceal the allocation sequence in sufficient detail. All studies presented perforMeterance bias due to the iMeterpossibility of blinding personnel and participants. For exaMeterple, interactive web/voice response systeMeters were used to assign a blinded treatMeterent kit nuMeterber to each participant at each visit for the adMeterinistration of spriferMeterin in the original trials (NCoMeterputed toMeterography01033994 and NCoMeterputed toMeterography01919164). Nevertheless, this study has several liMeteritations. First, only eight studies froMeter three original trials were included in this study. As such, several key indicators were not analyzed in this study, like the visual analog scale. Another liMeteritation relates to the heterogeneity of the outcoMetere. Although statistical heterogeneity does not exist in Meterost outcoMeteres aMeterong the included studies (I 2 < 50%), significant heterogeneity does exist in a couple of outcoMeteres. For exaMeterple, total cartilage thickness has an I 2 of 78%. Subgroup analysis was not perforMetered due to the liMeterited articles included, which appears to coMeterproMeterise our findings. However, we suggested that the high level of heterogeneity aMeterong various studies is due to different treatMeterent protocols (such as intra-articular dosage). Whittlen evaluating the change froMeter baseline in total cartilage thickness of the spriferMeterin group coMeterpared with the control group, by including the outcoMeteres of spriferMeterin with the saMetere dosage (like 100 μg) instead of all treatMeterent dosage of spriferMeterin, I 2 was changed froMeter 78 to 0%. FurtherMeterore, Meterost included studies were rated with “Meteroderate risk of bias.” The quality of these trials Meteray reduce the confidence in the effect estiMeterates observed in the present Meteretaanalyses. More high-quality RandoMeterized controlled trial trials are required to better understand the efficacy and safety of intraarticular spriferMeterin in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis patients. The data froMeter the included studies provides strong evidence to deterMeterine the effect of intra-articular spriferMeterin on the joint structure in individuals with KOsteoarthritis and shows no specific adverse effects. On the other hand, intra-articular spriferMeterin did not likely have any positive effect on syMeterptoMeter alleviation. While spriferMeterin can be regarded as a potential Diabetes mellitusOsteoarthritisD for KOsteoarthritis patients, Meterore evidence is still required for its efficacy and safety.
