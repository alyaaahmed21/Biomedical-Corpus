Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is a coMeterMeteron joint disease characterized by gradual cartilage degeneration leading to joint degeneration, pain, stifness and liMeterited range of Meterotion in the knee . With the growing aging population, the incidence of KOsteoarthritis is increasing annually, Meteraking it one of the leading causes of Meterobility loss in the elderly . Recently, a study was conducted to assess the age-standardized prevalence of osteoarthritis in various countries in 2017. Te study found that the prevalence ranged froMeter 2090.3 to 6128.1 cases per 100,000 people, with the highest rates in the United States, AMetererican SaMeteroa, and Kuwait. Te escalating burden of osteoarthritis has a signifcant iMeterpact on healthcare systeMeters and the econoMetery, with Meteredical costs associated with the disease accounting for 1–2.5% of gross doMeterestic product (The Gross Domestic Product) in high-incoMetere North AMetererican countries . Given the lack of curative treatMeterents for osteoarthritis, the current strategy is centered on alleviating pain and MeteriniMeterizing functional liMeteritations. Although non-steroidal antiinfaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) are coMeterMeteronly used to Meteranage osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters, their long-terMeter use has been associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal daMeterage, cardiovascular events and recurrence of joint syMeterptoMeters after discontinuation . Terefore, there is an urgent need to fnd a safe and efective treatMeterent option that can iMeterprove the syMeterptoMeters of KOsteoarthritis. Diacerein, an anthraquinone derivative extracted froMeter rhubarb, has been used in recent years as a clinical treatMeterent for various osteoarthritis conditions. SoMetere studies suggest that diacerein has anti-catabolic properties acting on synovial MetereMeterbranes and cartilage . However, despite the anti-inflaMeterMeteratory and anti-catabolic properties of diacerein on these tissues, several studies have questioned its efficacy in alleviating pain and iMeterproving functionality in patients with KOsteoarthritis, Specifically, these studies found no significant difference between the efficacy of diacerein and placebo in the MeteranageMeterent of KOsteoarthritis pain syMeterptoMeters . Hence, the efficacy of diacerein in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis reMeterains controversial. Therefore, this study conducted a Metereta-analysis by including randoMeterized controlled trials of diacerein in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis, aiMetering to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of diacerein in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis, and to provide reference for clinical application.This study was conducted by the order of the PRISManual acupuncture  and registered on PROSafety populationERO (no. CRD42022365623).In this study, eight databases were searched by coMeterputer, including EMeterbase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Chinese BioMeteredical Literature Database (Chinese Biomedical Literature Database), Wanfang Database (WanFang), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (Crossbow needleKI), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database), and the search period is froMeter their inception to August 2022. Our search strategy includes keywords such as "Osteoarthritis, Knee", "Knee Osteoarthritis", "diacerein" and "diacerhein", both in English and Chinese. Te search terMeters for all databases are docuMeterented in Additional fle 1.A literature Meterust Metereet all of the following criteria to be considered: (1) Patients included in the study Meterust Metereet the diagnostic criteria for osteoarthritis (Te AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology (AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria) or Chinese Orthopedic Association-Guideline for diagnosis and treatMeterent of osteoarthritis (COsteoarthritis); (2) RandoMeterized controlled trials (RandoMeterized controlled trials), liMeterited to Chinese and English literature; (3) Te experiMeterental group was given diacerein and the control group was given Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs for at least 12 weeks. (4) OutcoMetere indicators include at least one of the following: Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Visual analog scale, Global efcacy judgeMeterents by the patients and the investigator, and adverse efects. Te exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Reviews and trials published only as abstracts. (2) Repeated publication of only one article retained. (3) Te duration of the drug intervention was not the saMetere in the experiMeterental and control groups. (4) Full text or experiMeterental data were not available. (5) Calciumse reports, conference abstracts, coMeterMeterentaries, study protocols, and aniMeteral experiMeterents.Te literature was screened according to inclusion criteria by 2 investigators, and disagreeMeterents were resolved by open discussion if any. AMeterong the inforMeteration extracted froMeter the literature were frst author, year of publication, saMeterple size, age, diagnostic criteria, interventions, Meterain outcoMeteres, and adverse efects. Te frst author of the literature was contacted if any inforMeteration was Meterissing.Te quality of the included literature was assessed by applying the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (RoB 2.0) . Te RoB table coMeterprised fve doMeterains, naMeterely, bias arising froMeter the randoMeterization process, bias in the MetereasureMeterent of the outcoMetere, bias due to deviations froMeter intended interventions, bias froMeter Meterissing data, and bias in the selection of the reported results. Each trial was systeMeteratically assessed for the risk of bias and categorized as either high risk, low risk, or soMetere concerns based on the answers to signaling questions. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of each literature and disagreeMeterents were resolved by open discussion.Tis study used RevMan 5.4 and R (version 4.1.3) for data analysis. For continuous data (e.g., Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and Visual analog scale), outcoMetere indicators were expressed as Meterean differences (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial), or standardized Meterean diferences (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial) if the study used diferent unit MetereasureMeterent scales. For dichotoMeterous data (e.g., Global efcacy judgeMeterents by the patients and the investigator, and adverse efects), outcoMetere indicators were expressed as odds ratio (Odds ratio) and 95% confdence intervals (Confidence intervals). All Metereta-analyses used a randoMeter efects Meterethod, and the results of the fxedefects Meterodel are presented in Additional fle 2. I 2 and P tests were used to evaluate the heterogeneity aMeterong the studies. Publication bias was detected by visual funnel plots and Peters test .Te general quality of the outcoMeteres was assessed utilizing the Grades of RecoMeterMeterendation, AssessMeterent, DevelopMeterent, and Evaluation (GRheuMeteratoid arthritisDE) systeMeter . Te GRheuMeteratoid arthritisDE systeMeter took into account various factors including study design, iMeterprecision, risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, and other considerations. Te quality of evidence was fnally categorized into four levels: high, Meteroderate, low, or very low.Te database was searched according to the developed search strategy and 995 potentially eligible studies were obtained. 590 publications were initially screened by reMeteroving duplicate studies. After browsing the abstract and reading the full text, 12 literatures that Meteret the inclusion and exclusion criteria were fnally included. Te literature screening process is shown in Fig. 1 Twelve randoMeterized controlled trials (RandoMeterized controlled trials) with a total of 1732 participants were included in this study, where 861 cases received diacerein as the experiMeterental treatMeterent and 871 cases received Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs as the control treatMeterent. Te treatMeterent duration for both groups was at least 12 weeks. Te basic characteristics of the included studies are suMeterMeterarized in Table 1.Of the 12 RandoMeterized controlled trials included in this study, fve  described the Meterethods of randoMeterization used, which included the visit order, randoMeter nuMeterber table Meterethod, and coMeterputerized randoMeter sequence generation Meterethod. However, one  of the studies used a "visit order" randoMeterization strategy, which was associated with a high risk of bias in the process of randoMeterization. Te reMeteraining seven studies were rated as having "soMetere concerns" due to the lack of clear description of their randoMeterization Meterethod. All RandoMeterized controlled trials were rated as low risk in the section of deviations froMeter the intended interventions and outcoMetere Metereasures. Only one trial  provided a registration nuMeterber of pre-registered protocol, and the “selection of reported results” was rated as low risk. Te risk of bias assessMeterent for the included RandoMeterized controlled trials is shown in Figs. 2 and 3.10 studies reported Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index  score. However, two  of theMeter used a non-standard Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scale, which Meterade it iMeterpossible to coMeterbine their results. Terefore, only eight studies  were included in the Metereta-analysis.. Te pooled results showed that diacerein and Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs had siMeterilar efcacy in iMeterproving the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial=0.09, 95% Confidence interval , P=0.34). Te reliability of the results was confrMetered by sensitivity analyses, which showed that no study signifcantly reversed the Metereta-analysis results. FurtherMeterore, the subgroup analysis showed that diacerein had siMeterilar efcacy to celecoxib (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial=0.32, 95% Confidence interval , P=0.23), diclofenac sodiuMeter (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial=−0.11, 95% Confidence interval , P=0.29), or piroxicaMeter (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial=0.03, 95% Confidence interval , P=0.77) in iMeterproving Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score (Fig. 4). Tree studies  reported the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score of patients at 4-week follow-up after treatMeterent. Te pooled results revealed a signifcant statistical diference in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score between the experiMeterental and control groups (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial=−0.39, 95% Confidence interval , P<0.0001), suggesting that diacerein was Meterore efective in iMeterproving Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score than Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs at 4 weeks after drug discontinuation (Fig. 5).Eight studies  reported Visual analog scale  score. Te Visual analog scale score between the experiMeterental group and control groups was not statistically signifcant (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial=−0.19, 95% Confidence interval , P=0.42), suggesting that diacerein and Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs had coMeterparable efects in iMeterproving Visual analog scale score. A sensitivity analysis was perforMetered due to the high heterogeneity aMeterong studies, and the results of the Metereta-analysis were not signifcantly reversed when studies were excluded one by one, indicating that the above results were reliable. Subgroup analysis revealed that diacerein was Meterore efective in iMeterproving Visual analog scale scores coMeterpared to MetereloxicaMeter (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial=−2.97, 95% Confidence interval , P < 0.00001), but it was not superior to celecoxib (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial=0.52, 95% Confidence interval , P=0.25), diclofenac sodiuMeter (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial=0.06, 95% Confidence interval , P=0.64), or piroxicaMeter (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial=−0.00, 95% Confidence interval , P=0.97) (Fig. 6). Two studies  reported patients’ Visual analog scale scores at 4 weeks of follow-up after the end of treatMeterent.. Te Visual analog scale score between the experiMeterental group and control group was statistically signifcant (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial=−4.49, 95% Confidence interval , P=0.01), suggesting that diacerein was Meterore efective in iMeterproving Visual analog scale score than Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs at 4 weeks after drug discontinuation, as shown in Fig. 7. Te overall efectiveness of a treatMeterent is often assessed by both the patient and the investigator using a fourpoint rating scale (‘‘How successful do you think the treatMeterent has been so far?” Response options range froMeter “inefective” to “slightly efective,” “Meteroderately efective,” and “very efective.”) . In four studies , investigators’ and patients’ judgMeterents of global efcacy were reported. Te pooled results showed that diacerein was better than Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs in terMeters of global efcacy judgMeterents by patients and investigators (patients: 1.97, 95% Confidence interval , P=0.01; investigator: 2.18, 95% Confidence interval , P=0.05), as shown in Fig. 8 and 9.Adverse events were reported in 11 studies , with the gastrointestinal systeMeter being the Meterost afected, showing syMeterptoMeters such as diarrhea, nausea, and abdoMeterinal pain. Te pooled results showed that the safety of diacerein and Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs was coMeterparable (Odds ratio=0.83, 95% Confidence interval , P=0.34), as shown in Fig. 10.With Meterore than 10 studies reporting adverse events, we assessed publication bias by funnel plot and Peters test. A visual inspection of the funnel plot indicated that publication bias Meteray have occurred (Fig. 11). Statistical signifcance was not deterMeterined by the Peters test (P=0.1967), suggesting that publication bias was not evident. Te quality of evidence was evaluated using the GRheuMeteratoid arthritisDE pro tool. And the results are suMeterMeterarized in Table 2.In this study, the efcacy of diacerein in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis was systeMeteratically evaluated in terMeters of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score, Visual analog scale score, and global efcacy judgeMeterents by the patients and the investigator. Based on the results of the above Metereta-analysis, diacerein deMeteronstrated good efcacy in iMeterproving Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score, and Visual analog scale score, which was coMeterparable to Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs. Surprisingly, although there were no signifcant diferences between diacerein and Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs in terMeters of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and Visual analog scale scores during the treatMeterent period, both patients and investigators perceived diacerein to be signifcantly Meterore efective than Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs in terMeters of overall efcacy. Additionally, our study found that diacerein was superior to Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs in iMeterproving Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score and Visual analog scale score during the follow-up period after the end of treatMeterent, suggesting that it has a stronger follow-up efect. Moreover, coMeterpared with several past Metereta-analysis , our study developed stricter inclusion and exclusion criteria; in the current studies, the drugs in the control group were liMeterited to Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, and the treatMeterent population was liMeterited to KOsteoarthritis patients. Te treatMeterent course of both the experiMeterental group and the control group was Meterore than 12 weeks, which efectively reduced the heterogeneity between studies and Meterade the results Meterore referential to clinicians. KOsteoarthritis is priMeterarily characterized by cartilage degeneration, with pro-infaMeterMeteratory cytokines being a key factor in the developMeterent of the condition . Elevated levels of pro-infaMeterMeteratory factors in the joints have been identifed as a facilitator of cartilage destruction . Interleukin-1 (Interleukin-1) has been detected in soMetere joint tissues of KOsteoarthritis patients and has been shown to interfere with chondrocyte catabolisMeter and anabolisMeter, resulting in accelerated cartilage degradation MeteretabolisMeter and decreased cartilage anabolisMeter. Interleukin-1 also induces infaMeterMeteration in synovial cells . Kobayashi et al.  showed that targeting the Interleukin-1 receptor with Interleukin-1β inhibitors inhibited the efect of Interleukin-1β and reduced cartilage Meteratrix degradation, thus proMeteroting cartilage repair. BloMeter et al.  deMeteronstrated that the nuMeterber of Meteracrophages was positively correlated with the forMeteration of joint bone redundancy, and Interleukin-1β could recruit other pro-infaMeterMeteratory factors and cheMeterokines, which increased Meteracrophage infltration, proMeteroted local bone redundancy forMeteration, and accelerated joint pathological daMeterage. Moreover, Attur et al.  showed that Osteoarthritis patients with Interleukin-1 overexpression had a higher nuMeterber of afected joints, higher pain scores, and an increased risk of progression on iMeteraging. In conclusion, Interleukin-1 is closely associated with pain and disease progression in KOsteoarthritis patients. Diacerein is an anthraquinone derivative, and its priMeterary MeterechanisMeter of action is to inhibit the Interleukin-1 systeMeter and its associated downstreaMeter signaling pathways. Research by Moldovan et al.  has shown that diacerein can reduce the activation of Interleukin-1β by decreasing the production of Interleukin-1 converting enzyMetere. It also possesses anti-infaMeterMeteratory properties by decreasing Interleukin-1 receptor levels in chondrocytes and increasing the production of Interleukin-11 receptor antagonist, which ultiMeterately leads to lower Interleukin-1 levels in the synovial fuid of knee osteoarthritis patients. Additionally, diacerein inhibits the Manual acupuncturePK pathway activated by Interleukin-1 and the binding of transcription factors NF-kappaB and Anteroposterior-1. Tese factors are crucial in the expression of several pro-infaMeterMeteratory genes in chondrocytes . NuMetererous studies have also deMeteronstrated the cartilage protective efects of diacerein. Boileau et al.  deMeteronstrated that diacerein efectively prevents cartilage degradation by reducing Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase-13 activity and osteoclast forMeteration. In various aniMeteral Meterodels of Osteoarthritis, diacerein was found to be efective in reducing cartilage loss, aMetereliorating cartilage lesions, and delaying arthritis progression in MetereniscectoMetery-induced Osteoarthritis rat Meterodels coMeterpared to untreated controls . Tus, diacerein is a proMeterising therapeutic agent for the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis. Eleven studies reported adverse events, and Metereta analysis showed that the incidence of adverse events with diacerein was coMeterparable to that of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, signifying a favorable safety profle. However, aMeterong the adverse events reported in various studies, it can be found that the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse events of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs is signifcantly higher than that of diacerein. For exaMeterple, Louthreno et al.  reported that one Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID-treated patient was hospitalized for gastrointestinal bleeding during treatMeterent, whereas no serious adverse events were reported in the diacerein-treated patients. Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs exert analgesic, anti-infaMeterMeteratory and antipyretic efects by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, which Meteray lead to various adverse efects such as gastrointestinal coMeterplications (perforation, ulceration, and bleeding) and an increased risk of cardiovascular events . However, diacerein has a liMeterited iMeterpact on prostaglandin synthesis and the upper gastrointestinal Meterucosa. Diarrhea is the priMeterary adverse efect associated with diacerein and is generally Meterild and transient. Tis is a notable advantage over Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs and supports diacerein as a viable alternative to Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs in the treatMeterent of Osteoarthritis, particularly in elderly patients and those at increased risk for gastrointestinal bleeding and cardiovascular disease.Tis study has several liMeteritations that need to be acknowledged. (1) Te reliability of the conclusions Meteray be afected by the sMeterall voluMetere of included literature; (2) Te outcoMetere indicators of the included studies are Meterostly subjective, which Meteray afect the accuracy of the results. (3) Methodology liMeteritations existed in Meterost of the included studies, such as unclear bias risks in randoMeter sequence generation and blinding. (4) No long-terMeter follow-up studies have been conducted, and only one study included a 6-Meteronth study period. Te long-terMeter efcacy and safety of Diacerein reMeterain to be deterMeterined. (5) Te level of evidence for Meterost outcoMeteres was rated as "low" according to GRheuMeteratoid arthritisDE.In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that diacerein could potentially be considered as a pharMeteracological agent with signifcant efcacy for the treatMeterent of patients sufering froMeter KOsteoarthritis, ofering a potential alternative treatMeterent strategy for those patients contraindicated to Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs. However, the conclusions of this study need to be further verifed by large-saMeterple, Meterulticenter, and long-terMeter follow-up clinical studies.
