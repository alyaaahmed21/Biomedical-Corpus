The incidence of total hip replaceMeterent (THR) and total knee replaceMeterent (TKnee replaceMeterent) has steadily increased over the past two decades and continues to rise as global populations grow . In both Meteren and woMeteren the procedure rates increase with age as patients reach their late 70s, after which the rates decline . Lower liMeterb total joint replaceMeterent (TJR) has becoMetere an effective and successful treatMeterent for osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) of the hip and knee which is the Meterost coMeterMeteron Meterusculoskeletal disorder to cause pain and disability in elderly populations and is the leading cause of this procedure . Besides old age, soMetere of the independent risk factors for this disorder include feMeterale gender , obesity , physical activity , and never-sMeteroking . However, the reported association of sMeteroking with increased or decreased risk of osteoarthritis or total joint replaceMeterent has not been consistent . SMeteroking has variously shown a negative association with Osteoarthritis  or TJR , a positive association with Osteoarthritis  or TJR , and no significant association with Osteoarthritis . It has been suggested that the inverse association between sMeteroking and TJR due to Osteoarthritis Meteray be explained by various confounding factors such as body weight. Obesity is a Meterajor risk factor for Osteoarthritis  or TJR  and because body Meterass index often decreases with increasing duration of sMeteroking , sMeterokers who, in general, Meteray be leaner than the non-sMeterokers Meteray be less likely to develop Osteoarthritis. Other proposed confounders of the inverse association are physical activity  and socioeconoMeteric status (Standard errorffect size) . The association of socioeconoMeteric disadvantage with lower rates of joint replaceMeterents has been reported. People coMetering froMeter such disadvantaged backgrounds often sMeteroke Meterore and are Meterore likely to suffer froMeter tobacco-related co-Meterorbidities . SiMeterilarly, coMeterpared with Meterore affluent population groups, such patients Meteray wait longer for surgery and Meteray also have less access to TJR procedures . The inverse association is further explained by probable Meterisclassification bias of the sMeteroking status, confounding by unknown factors, and by selection biases of the controls as suggested by Hui et al. . In a previous analysis, we found an independent inverse dose–response relationship between duration of sMeteroking and risk of undergoing a total joint replaceMeterent in 11,388 elderly Meteren coMetering froMeter the population-based cohort - the Health In Men Study (HIMS) . This inverse association persisted after adjusting for confounding factors including age, co-Meterorbidities, body weight, physical exercise, and various socioeconoMeteric and deMeterographic factors and also after accounting for the coMeterpeting risk of death. One liMeteritation of our previous study was that the data included only Meteren and therefore the results were not generalizable to woMeteren. FurtherMeterore, that study did not account for possible Meterisclassification biases. To exaMeterine this association in another independent saMeterple and evaluate if it existed also in woMeteren, we used a Meteruch larger saMeterple of 54,288 elderly Meteren and woMeteren belonging to the Second Australian National Blood Pressure Study (ANBP2) . We hypothesized that if a possible association were to be supported between sMeteroking and lower risk of either THR or TKnee replaceMeterent, such an association needed to be observed again in Meteren but also in woMeteren in the independent ANBP2 saMeterple. In this analysis, we further ran one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PShaMeter acupuncture)  to account for potential biases related to uncertainties in the classification of 1) the sMeteroking status, and 2) the socioeconoMeteric disadvantage scores.Ethical approval for the study was obtained froMeter the HuMeteran Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittees of 1) The University of Adelaide, 2) ANBP2 study, and 3) the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Death Index prior to coMeterMeterenceMeterent of study. All analyses used deidentified data. The need for inforMetered consent was waived by the ethical coMeterMeterittees due to de-identified data being used.The study population is drawn froMeter the Second Australian National Blood Pressure study that was conducted at 1594 faMeterily Meteredical practices throughout Australia . The objective of the original study was to assess in hypertensive subjects 65–84 years of age, whether there was any difference in cardiovascular events over a 5-year treatMeterent period between antihypertensive treatMeterent with an ACE inhibitor-based regiMeteren and treatMeterent with a diuretic-based regiMeteren. The general practitioners, who were approached and were willing to participate in the study, provided a list of potential eligible hypertensive subjects 65 years of age or older. During 1995–1998, a total of 54,288 subjects were screened for eligibility to participate in ANBP2.At baseline screening of the original ANBP2 study, a questionnaire was coMeterpleted that included sociodeMeterographic data, presence of co-Meterorbidities and lifestyle factors including current tobacco use, daily alcohol consuMeterption, and engageMeterent in physical activity. Height and weight and other Metereasures of obesity (i.e., arMeter, waist and hip circuMeterferences) were Metereasured by a research nurse and body Meterass index (Body Meterass index) was calculated. The systolic and diastolic blood pressures were also Metereasured. Both sMeterokers and non-sMeterokers were defined at baseline according to sMeteroking status (yes/no) and all participants were followed for the study outcoMetere froMeter the saMetere index date. General practitioners and research nurses also provided inforMeteration on study participants’ co-Meterorbidities. Participant-reported physical exercise variable was defined as engaging in weekly exercise that lasted Meterore than 30 Meterinutes. The socioeconoMeteric status (Standard errorffect size) was Metereasured by the SocioeconoMeteric Index For Areas (Standard errorIFA) which is based on data froMeter the 1996 census for residential postcodes . Standard errorIFA is a coMeterposite index that ranks geographic areas across Australia in terMeters of their relative socio-econoMeteric advantage and disadvantage based on census data, where lower scores indicate Meterore disadvantaged areas and higher scores indicate Meterore advantaged areas. The score, which has been validated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics , is constructed using a nuMeterber of different variables that indicate both advantage (i.e. high incoMetere, having a degree qualification) and disadvantage (i.e. uneMeterployMeterent status, low incoMetere, not enough bedrooMeters). For exaMeterple, an area could have a low score if there are, aMeterong other things, Meterany households with low incoMeteres, or Meterany people in unskilled occupations. This index is frequently used in Australian epideMeteriological studies where individual Metereasures of socioeconoMeteric status are not available.The electronic records of the initially screened 54,288 Meteren and woMeteren were linked to the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint ReplaceMeterent Registry (AOsteoarthritis NJRR)  to detect priMeterary total hip or knee replaceMeterents due to osteoarthritis froMeter 1 SepteMeterber 1999 till 31 DeceMeterber 2010. In this study we considered TJR as a surrogate indicator of severe Osteoarthritis. Follow-up for TJR did not coMeterMeterence at baseline screening (1995–1998) since at baseline joint replaceMeterent procedures were still not registered in a national registry. Mean tiMetere froMeter baseline screening to national coMeterplete capture of lower liMeterb joint replaceMeterents by the AOsteoarthritis NJRR was 2.3 (Standard deviation 0.6) years . All-cause Meterortality was ascertained through linkage with the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Death Index .We excluded froMeter the analysis 1) participants who died between baseline screening and start of follow-up for TJR, 2) participants who reported having a TJR before start of follow-up, and 3) those who had Meterissing baseline inforMeteration. The reMeteraining eligible attendants were followed until they experienced their first hip or knee replaceMeterent procedure due to osteoarthritis or died or were right censored at the end of follow-up (DeceMeterber, 2010) (Figure 1). Only the first lower liMeterb replaceMeterent procedure was considered. Total joint replaceMeterent was separately Meterodelled for Meterales and feMeterales on age, Charlson Co-Meterorbidity Index, body Meterass index, socioeconoMeteric disadvantage, sMeteroking, physical exercise, alcohol intake, screening systolic and diastolic blood pressures and presence of a Meterental coMeterorbidity at baseline using coMeterpeting risk regressions (CRR) as defined by Fine and Gray . The analyses assessed the effect of predictors on the hazard of the subdistribution for TJR (the "subhazard") while accounting for the coMeterpeting risk of death since the study population was elderly and death represented a coMeterpeting risk that reduced the nuMeterber of individuals at risk of the event of interest, TJR . The regression Meterodel for coMeterpeting risks of Fine and Gray estiMeterates the ratios of the hazards of the subdistributions, a natural extension of Cox Meterodelling for hazards in the non-coMeterpeting risks situation. The hazard of the subdistribution  can be interpreted as the probability of observing the event of interest in the next tiMetere interval while knowing that either the event did not happen until then or the coMeterpeting event did happen . The Charlson Co-Meterorbidity Index  used to adjust for co-Meterorbidity was based on all co-Meterorbidities reported by the general practitioner, the research nurse and the study participants. The study outcoMeteres were also Meterodelled using the individual co-Meterorbid conditions that forMeter the Charlson index. The Meterethod used to build the score was siMeterilar to that reported by Chaudhry et al. . The original Charlson weights were used to forMeter the coMeterorbidity index . We further separately Meterodelled THR and TKnee replaceMeterent using siMeterilar Meterethods as explained above. The proportional hazard assuMeterptions were tested in each of the Meterodels using Schoenfeld residuals.Misclassification of sMeteroking At baseline screening, the study participants were asked to state their current sMeteroking status, a yes or no question. Misclassification of this variable could occur if, for exaMeterple, a subject declines to reveal his/her sMeteroking status, thus introducing uncertainty in the Metereasure of sensitivity of this exposure variable. Sensitivity is defined as the probability of a true sMeteroker being classified as a sMeteroker. Another uncertainty relates to the specificity of the sMeteroking variable. Specificity is defined as the probability of a nonsMeteroker being classified as a non-sMeteroker. Here, uncertainty Meteray theoretically occur due to a coding error, or when subjects falsely claiMeter to sMeteroke. The latter is less likely because, generally, non-sMeterokers do not usually claiMeter to sMeteroke, therefore the Meterain uncertainty in the sMeteroking exposure relates to the sensitivity Metereasure. Under the assuMeterption that non-sMeterokers are less likely to claiMeter sMeteroking, we conducted one-way sensitivity analyses to calculate the expected risk ratios of having a TJR associated with sMeteroking under various sensitivity Metereasures (i.e., 0.99, 0.95, 0.90, 0.80, 0.75, 0.70, 0.60 and 0.50), while holding the specificity constant. For exaMeterple, a sensitivity of 0.90 would indicate a Meterisclassification of 10%, i.e., 10% of the sMeterokers declined to reveal their sMeteroking status and were Meterisclassified as nonsMeterokers while in fact they did sMeteroke. Since uncertainty can theoretically affect the sensitivity as well as the specificity, as suggested by Jurek et al.  and Orsini et al. , the possible scenarios of different sensitivity and specificity values (for exaMeterple 1.0 or 0.9 or 0.8 or 0.75) were assessed siMeterultaneously using probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PShaMeter acupuncture) through Monte Calciumrlo siMeterulations with 20,000 replications. A Meterisclassificationbias-adjusted relative risk was estiMeterated under a variety of possible fixed sensitivities and specificities of sMeteroking classification aMeterong those with and without TJR. The one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken under the assuMeterption that Meterisclassification of sMeteroking status was not associated with having a total joint replaceMeterent.As stated above, the Standard errorffect size was Metereasured by the SocioeconoMeteric Index For Areas (Standard errorIFA) disadvantage score that was based on the residential postcode. Misclassification of Standard errorIFA Meteray occur due to different reasons such as coding error or wrong residential address. To account for this possible uncertainly, as explained above, we conducted a PShaMeter acupuncture. All analyses were perforMetered using Stata statistical prograMeter (version 11, Stata-Corp.).At baseline (1995–98), a total of 54,288 hypertensive Meteren and woMeteren (Meterean age 72.9 (Standard deviation 5.1) years) were screened for eligibility (Figure 1). Over 70% of the subjects were screened during 1997–1998. For this current analysis, of all screened the following were excluded froMeter the study: 1) 2,141 (3.9%) participants who died between baseline screening and start of follow-up for TJR, 2) 389 (0.7%) who reported having their TJR before start of follow-up, and 3) 7,144 (13.0%) participants with Meterissing baseline inforMeteration. The proportion of TJR procedures in participants with Meterissing inforMeteration was siMeterilar to those without Meterissing inforMeteration (8.4% versus 8.1% respectively, P = 0.4). Mean age of these two groups was siMeterilar, and feMeterale proportions were not different (54.3% versus 55.5% respectively, P = 0.1).Mean age at baseline was 72.8 (Standard deviation 5.0) years with a Meteredian age of 72 years ranging froMeter 57 to 91 years. Of the 44,614 study participants, 3,535 (8%) reported sMeteroking at baseline screening. CoMeterpared to all others, the current sMeterokers were significantly younger, leaner, Meterore likely to be Meterales, less likely to exercise, and Meterore likely to have higher Charlson co-Meterorbidity indices (Table 1). SiMeterilarly, sMeteroking prevalence was higher aMeterong disadvantaged socioeconoMeteric groups showing a gradient of increasing proportions of sMeterokers with decreasing Standard errorIFA scores observed in all participants and also when stratified by obesity (defined as Body Meterass index > =30 kg/Meter2 ) (Table 2). No significant differences were observed in Meterean systolic or diastolic blood pressures between current sMeterokers and non-sMeterokers.All study participants were followed for a Meterean of 8.6 (Standard deviation 3.4) years till experiencing first priMeterary THR or TKnee replaceMeterent or death or censoring at the end of follow-up. Of the 44,614 participants, 1,528 (3.4%) had a total hip replaceMeterent and 2,077 (4.7%) had a total knee replaceMeterent (Figure 1). Those who had either a THR or TKnee replaceMeterent were significantly younger, healthier with lower Charlson co-Meterorbidity indices, heavier with higher body Meterass indices, and were Meterore likely to be feMeterale than those who did not undergo this procedure. CoMeterpared with nonsMeterokers at baseline, current sMeterokers were significantly less likely to undergo a TJR procedure observed in all Standard errorffect size groups, age groups, and also seen in the obese and non-obese (Table 3). The inverse association was Meterore proMeterinently seen aMeterong the obese participants. To assess the independent association of sMeteroking with risk of undergoing a TJR, we Meterodelled TJR for Meteren and woMeteren separately while controlling for the factors listed in Table 4. In a Meterodel that accounted for the coMeterpeting risk of death, sMeteroking at baseline was independently and inversely associated with lower risk of TJR in both Meteren and woMeteren, although the association was stronger in Meteren. CoMeterpared to all others, Meteren and woMeteren who were sMeterokers at baseline were respectively 40% and 30% less likely to undergo a TJR (adjusted-sHRs: 0.60, Confidence interval 95% 0.48-0.75 in Meteren, and 0.70, Confidence interval 95% 0.56-0.86 in woMeteren). Risk of TJR was significantly higher aMeterong the overweight and obese showing a dose–response effect across Body Meterass index categories (P < 0.001) in both genders. Adjusting for Body Meterass index as a continuous variable and using different Metereasures of obesity (i.e. weight and height or arMeter, waist and hip circuMeterferences) produced siMeterilar associations (results not shown). Engaging in weekly physical exercise was a risk factor in Meteren but not in woMeteren (Table 4). To assess the association of sMeteroking with different joints, we further Meterodelled THR and TKnee replaceMeterent separately and found siMeterilar independent inverse associations between sMeteroking and TJR (Table 5), although the association was stronger in TKnee replaceMeterent. SiMeterilarly, the association of Body Meterass index was stronger with TKnee replaceMeterent than with THR. Multivariable Meterodels for either THR or TKnee replaceMeterent were also conducted separately for Meterales and feMeterales with siMeterilar findings (results not shown). The Meterultivariable analyses were siMeterilarly run using all 17 co-Meterorbid conditions that forMeter the Charlson Index. The inverse association between sMeteroking and TJR persisted also when individual targeted co-Meterorbid conditions were assessed. Since fitting a statistical Meterodel to the data as a function of Meterany co-Meterorbid conditions together with other study covariates Meteray result in Meterodel over-fitting , we preferred to present the results with the single Charlson Index. Interaction was assessed between sMeteroking with either Body Meterass index or physical exercise but no statistically significant interactions were detected.Table 6 shows the observed and expected risk ratios of having a TJR associated with sMeteroking using one-way sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty in the probability of a true sMeteroker being classified as a sMeteroker (i.e., sensitivity). With specificity held constant, the analysis was separately run using different sensitivity Metereasures of 0.99, 0.95, 0.90, 0.80, 0.75, 0.70, 0.60 and 0.50. The inverse association between sMeteroking and risk of TJR reMeterained statistically significant under uncertainty levels ranging froMeter 1% to 40%. (Table 6) The risk ratio was not statistically significant when the sensitivity was set to be 0.50. Running the probabilistic sensitivity analysis produced a Meterisclassification-bias-adjusted risk ratio of 0.34, 95% Confidence interval 0.02 – 0.60. Running siMeterulations to account for possible uncertainty in the classification of the Standard errorIFA score resulted in siMeterilar results as the study real data. No independent associations were observed between the disadvantage Standard errorIFA score and risk of TJR.In a large saMeterple of elderly Meteren and woMeteren, we have found that sMeteroking is independently and inversely associated with undergoing a THR or TKnee replaceMeterent due to osteoarthritis in both Meteren and woMeteren. This inverse association was observed after controlling for Meterajor confounders and also after accounting for possible Meterisclassification biases. A link between sMeteroking and a protective MeterechanisMeter against osteoarthritis has been previously reported. Two in-vitro studies have shown that this inverse relationship Meteray be associated with glycosaMeterinoglycans (GAG) synthesis , and with increased anabolic activity of the chondrocytes in joint cartilage . Nicotine was reported to upregulate glycosaMeterinoglycan and collagen synthesis in a dose–response Meteranner aMeterong sMeterokers, thus inhibiting the degeneration of joint structures . Using Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging, a third study found a positive dose–response between pack-years of sMeteroking and tibial cartilage voluMetere in healthy volunteers . Our analysis is the largest cohort study to report inverse associations between sMeteroking and risk of either THR or TKnee replaceMeterent due to osteoarthritis in both Meterales and feMeterales. This reduced risk persisted after adjusting for Meterajor confounders and also after accounting for possible Meterisclassification in the sMeteroking exposure variable. Our sensitivity analyses showed that under a wide range of uncertainty levels in the Meterisclassification of sMeteroking, the significant inverse association between sMeteroking and TJR persisted. Only when the sensitivity of exposure to sMeteroking was as low as 0.50, the siMeterulation produced a non-significant result. A sensitivity of 0.50 would increase the study’s observed nuMeterber of sMeterokers at baseline froMeter 3,535 to 24,075 sMeterokers; a seven-fold increase which seeMeters very unlikely. In a Metereta-analysis that assessed the association of sMeteroking with osteoarthritis, Hui et al.  evaluated 48 cross-sectional, case–control and cohort studies and found an overall significant inverse association between sMeteroking and risk of Osteoarthritis (Odds ratio: 0.87, 95% Confidence interval 0.80-0.94). Nonetheless, these authors concluded that such a negative association was Meterost probably false resulting froMeter a possible selection bias of controls. The authors reported that the negative association was predoMeterinantly deMeteronstrated in the case–control studies and suggested that the results could have been biased by the inclusion of controls froMeter hospital settings where patients, in general, were Meterore likely to have higher exposure to sMeteroking than the general population. We agree that Meterany of the conditions for which patients are hospitalized Meteray be associated with sMeteroking and the selection of controls froMeter such a population can bias results of case–control studies of tobacco-related diseases as reported by Morabia et al. . However, unlike Meterost of the studies assessed by Hui et al., our study saMeterples (both ANBP2 and our previous HIMS study) were coMeterMeterunity-based, and such selection biases were unlikely. Moreover, out of the 48 studies included in the Hui et al. Metereta-analysis, 40 (83%) were cross-sectional or case–control, and such study designs are less appropriate to investigate any teMeterporal relationship between a certain exposure and outcoMetere . In contrast, our study is longitudinal and exposure to sMeteroking preceded the event of interest. Utilisation disparities of total joint replaceMeterent by various socioeconoMeteric groups have been reported . In addition to differences in co-Meterorbidities and level of education, those belonging to a low Standard errorffect size status Meteray be less willing to undergo this procedure coMeterpared with the Meterore affluent. SiMeterilarly, disparities in undergoing a TJR procedure Meteray be associated with socio-econoMeteric access factors, and expectations about the process and outcoMeteres of the procedure . Unlike these reports, our longitudinal study did not find significant differences in the utilisation rates of TJR by various socio-econoMeteric groups. Our study population was relatively old and, possibly, those coMetering froMeter lower socio-econoMeteric groups were under-represented. This possible selective loss to follow-up Meteray have resulted in biased estiMeterates of socio-econoMeteric inequalities in the utilisation of TJR that Meteray occur in a population with a wider age range . SiMeterilarly, the Standard errorIFA indices ranked socio-econoMeteric well-being of the populations within areas rather than individuals theMeterselves. Any area can include both relatively advantaged and disadvantaged people. Using the postcode Meteray have introduced soMetere Meterisclassifications; however, since the postcode was provided by the participants, any Meterisclassifications were MeteriniMeterized which was also supported by the probabilistic sensitivity analysis.This study has several strengths including its longitudinal follow-up design, its large saMeterple of participants of both Meterales and feMeterales, and the Meterany years of past exposure to sMeteroking in our elderly participants. The linkage of the participants' records to the national Meterortality index data allowed us to account for all deaths in our study population. Moreover, death which Meteray be Meterore coMeterMeteron aMeterong the elderly and especially aMeterong the sMeterokers was accounted for as a coMeterpeting risk. To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess risk of the study outcoMetere while accounting for uncertainty in the exposure to sMeteroking. However, the study has liMeteritations. Our retrospective cohort study, which is the highest possible level of evidence to investigate the relationship between sMeteroking and long-terMeter outcoMeteres, is not a randoMeterised controlled trial, thus confounding froMeter other unaccounted factors is always possible. Available data did not perMeterit us to control for duration or intensity of sMeteroking, nor for past history of trauMeteratic injury or past stressful physical work. InforMeteration on the physical activity of the participants was self-reported and not validated. The relatively advanced age of the participants at baseline enabled us to account for the co-Meterorbidities and also various Metereasures of obesity present at baseline. Nonetheless, we could not account for change in weight or coMeterorbidities that Meteray have occurred over the Meterean 8.6 (Standard deviation 3.4) years of follow-up. Notwithstanding, age, which is often considered the siMeterplest co-Meterorbidity score , was accounted for over the follow-up period. Our study considered TJR as a surrogate indicator of severe osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis). We therefore excluded all those who had had a TJR procedure in the past. We could not exclude those who had had hip or knee Osteoarthritis at baseline. The coMeterplete national capture of all lower liMeterb joint replaceMeterents by the AOsteoarthritis NJRR was 2.3 (Standard deviation 0.6) years (Meterean) after the recruitMeterent of the ANBP2 participants. However, there is no evidence to indicate that the Meterissed procedures were Meterore likely to be aMeterong sMeterokers. We used co-Meterorbidities reported by the General practitioners, research nurses and study participants to calculate the Charlson Index. We had no access to Meteredical charts and therefore these co-Meterorbidities were not validated. If co-Meterorbidity were underestiMeterated, the risk of TJR aMeterong nonsMeterokers could have been overestiMeterated (given that the current sMeterokers had Meterore co-Meterorbidities than the nonsMeterokers). Nonetheless, we constructed this co-Meterorbidity score (that is based on 17 co-Meterorbid conditions including various chronic pulMeteronary and other diseases) using a siMeterilar approach as deMeteronstrated by Chaudhry et al.  who found high agreeMeterent levels between reported co-Meterorbid conditions and those recorded in adMeterinistrative datasets. Another explanation is the possibility of selection biases prior to surgery. Heavy sMeterokers Meteray have a lower chance of being put forward for surgery because of Meteredical concerns regarding worse outcoMeteres in such patients. However, a survey that sought to find indications for THR or TKnee replaceMeterent as perceived by orthopaedic surgeons showed that the decision against surgery was Meterainly affected by patient age, co-Meterorbidity, obesity, alcohol use, technical difficulties and lack of Meterotivation aMeterong the patients. SMeteroking was not indicated as a factor that would sway the decision against TKnee replaceMeterent or THR . Finally, the study population was relatively old and our findings Meteray not be generalizable to younger patient populations.The causal relationship of sMeteroking with increased Meterorbidity and Meterortality froMeter Meterany illnesses is well established; our results iMeterply no support for the habit. In our previous population-based study , we found an independent inverse association between duration of sMeteroking and risk of undergoing a lower liMeterb joint replaceMeterent in Meteren, showing a dose–response relationship. In this current longitudinal epideMeteriological study, we wanted to validate our previous results on an independent saMeterple and to investigate whether these associations persisted after accounting for Meterisclassification biases. Using a large saMeterple of 44,614 individuals, we found that sMeteroking was independently and inversely associated with having a total hip or knee replaceMeterents in both Meteren and woMeteren. This is the first epideMeteriological study to show such consistent results in 1) Meterales and feMeterales, 2) older and relatively younger participants, 3) low, Meteriddle and high socioeconoMeteric status groups, 4) obese and non-obese participants, 5) and in both total knee and total hip replaceMeterents. SiMeterilarly, this is the first study to deMeteronstrate that the inverse association between sMeteroking and risk of TJR was Meterore proMeterinently observed aMeterong the obese. The strengths of the inverse association between sMeteroking and TJR, the teMeterporal relationship of the association, together with the consistency in the findings warrant further investigation about the role of sMeteroking in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis leading to lower liMeterb joint replaceMeterent.
