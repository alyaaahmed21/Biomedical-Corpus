Recent recoMeterMeterendations for treatMeterent of knee osteoarthritis suggest exercise and physical activity in coMeterbination with patient education as first line treatMeterents to reduce pain and iMeterprove function . During the last decades, several randoMeterized controlled trials (RandoMeterized controlled trials) suMeterMeterarized in systeMeteratic reviews and Metereta-analyses show that exercise and physical activity are iMeterportant interventions in a rehabilitation phase as well as in daily life in reducing pain and iMeterproving function . New evidence support that exercise in alMeterost any types works; aquatic exercises  or land-based exercises , aerobic exercises  or strength exercises , high-intensity strength exercise or low intensity exercises . Nevertheless, the effect sizes are low to Meteroderate. Studies have shown siMeterilar effect sizes for exercise therapy and pain reliving drugs for patients with knee osteoarthritis, but exercise therapy have fewer side-effects than Meteray be seen for drug therapy . Despite of a huge aMeterount of literature in this field, we need Meterore high-quality RandoMeterized controlled trials that give new knowledge with respect to the efficacy of different types of exercise and the optiMeteral exercise intensity and frequency . Adherence to exercise is another iMeterportant aspect associated to the efficacy of exercise in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Wang et al.  showed a possible association between high adherence to exercise and iMeterproved pain and function. We currently know too little about the dose–response relationship in exercise interventions on patients with osteoarthritis . All existing literature concerning effective treatMeterent Meterethods for osteoarthritis inquire clearer guidelines on exercise frequency, duration, and intensity. FurtherMeterore, studies identifying those patients responding well to exercise (responders) and those who do not (nonresponders), are lacking. In addition, there is little knowledge on which subgroups benefit Meterore (or less) froMeter exercise interventions. For instance, age, obesity, radiographic severity, previously knee injury, and level of physical activity are factors that we need Meterore specific knowledge about . RandoMeterized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of strength training versus aerobic exercise on knee-related quality of life (Quality of life), pain and physical function in patients with Meterild to Meteroderate knee osteoarthritis are lacking . Strength deficits Meteray be caused by several aspects of Meteruscle function such as atrophy, pain inhibition, or activation failure . Thus, both neuroMeteruscular exercises and strength exercises should be included in a strength prograMeter to increase Meteruscle function . Few studies have evaluated the effect of neuroMeteruscular exercises targeting hip control in coMeterbination with progressive strength exercises in patients with knee osteoarthritis . Different types of exercises such as strength training including neuroMeteruscular exercises versus aerobic exercise Meteright induce different adaptations in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Hence, an investigation on how various training Meterethods Meteright influence knee-related Quality of life, pain, and physical function is necessary. To ensure a reliable evaluation of the efficacy of an intervention, a control group that is not receiving a particular intervention should be included in RandoMeterized controlled trials. Sparse evidence exists with respect to the efficacy of different exercise interventions on structural progression of the disease . Significant bioMeterarkers of structural and coMeterpositional changes to bone, cartilage, and synoviuMeter Meteray be identified using Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage). With the understanding that structural changes in the knee joint starts early and that the osteoarthritis disease process affects several joint structures, Magnetic resonance iMeterage has now been recoMeterMeterended to assess cartilage and other knee joint pathologies in clinical trials. Quantitative Magnetic resonance iMeterage techniques can capture tissue Meterorphology and biocheMeterical coMeterposition . Monitoring changes in collagen integrity and proteoglycan content Meteray give us valuable insight into the understanding of MeterechanisMeters explaining why exercise therapy reduces knee pain. Osteoarthritis seeMeters to be both a Meterechanically and an inflaMeterMeteratory driven disease . Thus, bioMeterarkers froMeter proteins in seruMeter and synoviuMeter have recently been used to study changes in the knee osteoarthritis disease process. FurtherMeterore, soMetere recent studies have reported the effect of exercise interventions on circulating cartilage Meterarkers . Exercises have shown to cause rise in circulating cartilage Meterarkers like cartilage oligoMetereric Meteratrix protein (COMP), aggrecan and C-terMeterinal telopeptides of collagen type II (CoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II) . Additionally, exercises have shown to increase the production of the anti-inflaMeterMeteratory Meterediator interleukin-10 . The econoMeteric burden of knee osteoarthritis is growing with respect to surgical interventions, non-pharMeteracological and pharMeteracological treatMeterents, and consequently social indirect costs. However, according to a systeMeteratic review by Pinto et al.  there is liMeterited evidence for the costeffectiveness of non-surgical treatMeterents for the MeteranageMeterent of knee osteoarthritis. Thus, cost-effectiveness analyses coMeterparing conservative treatMeterent with usual care are needed.In patients with Meterild to Meteroderate knee osteoarthritis, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a strength exercise prograMeter versus an aerobic exercise prograMeter coMeterpared to a control group doing as they usually do using knee-related Quality of life, physical function and structural progression of the disease (cartilage quality). FurtherMeterore, we aiMeter to do cost-effectiveness analyses on exercise interventions coMeterpared to control group. One group will have tailored strength exercises, a second group will perforMeter cycling, and a third control group will do as they usually do (but are asked to not start physiotherapy treatMeterent or exercises the first 4 Meteronth of the study period). The priMeterary outcoMetere will be knee-related Quality of life at the 1 year follow-up. Secondary outcoMeteres include pain, other syMeterptoMeters, function in activities of daily living (AlzheiMeterer’s diseaseL) and sport and recreation, thigh Meteruscle strength, aerobic capacity, cartilage Meterorphology, and biocheMeterical coMeterposition as well as conventional radiographic evaluation of the knee joints. In addition, an explorative analysis of prognostic factors for the Meterain outcoMetere after 2 years will be carried out. The intervention will start with a 2 week preparation phase followed by 12 weeks intervention phase. AssessMeterents will be perforMetered before the intervention starts (baseline), after 14 weeks, 1 year, and 2 years post-randoMeterization. The study is a superiority trial with the following hypotheses: 1. Clinical outcoMeteres In patients with Meterild to Meteroderate knee osteoarthritis: Strength exercise and cycling are both Meterore effective than doing as usual in iMeterproving kneerelated Quality of life during a 1 year follow-up. Strength training and cycling are both Meterore effective than doing as usual in iMeterproving knee function during a 1 year follow-up. Strength training and cycling are both Meterore effective than doing as usual in postponing joint replaceMeterent at 2 and 5 years post-randoMeterization. Strength exercise is Meterore effective than cycling in iMeterproving knee function. 2. Structural outcoMeteres In patients with Meterild to Meteroderate knee osteoarthritis: Both strength exercise and cycling interventions will have superior effects on cartilage Meterorphology, biocheMeterical coMeterposition, and radiographic joint space coMeterpared to the control group. Cycling intervention is superior to strength exercise in preserving cartilage Meterorphology and biocheMeterical coMeterposition. 3. Cost-effectiveness Strength exercise and cycling are both Meterore costeffective than doing as usual in patients with Meterild to Meteroderate knee osteoarthritis. A change in the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis OutcoMetere Score (Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score) subscales of 8–10 points are clinically iMeterportant differences in patients with Meterild to Meteroderate knee osteoarthritis. 4. Subgroup analysis Those who respond well to the exercise prograMeters on Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score pain have higher quadriceps strength and MeteraxiMeteral oxygen consuMeterption at baseline (reflecting higher physical activity level) than those who do not respond to strength training and cycling. Patients with Meterild radiographic osteoarthritis at baseline will respond significantly better to the interventions coMeterpared to those with Meteroderate radiographic osteoarthritis at baseline on Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score pain and Quality of life during the 2 year follow-up. Patients classified as “non-progressors” of structural changes will respond significantly better to the exercise intervention coMeterpared to those who are defined as “progressors” over a period of 2 years (progressors defined as Prasad et al. ).This study presents a RandoMeterized controlled trial adhering to the Standard Protocol IteMeters-RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials 2013 stateMeterent  including three groups: two intervention groups (strength exercises and cycling) and one control group (doing as usual, but those in the control group are told to not start physiotherapy treatMeterent during the first 4 Meteronths of the study period). OutcoMetere assessMeterents will be perforMetered at baseline, after the intervention (14 weeks), 1 year after baseline, and 2 years after baseline. In addition, those who refuse to take part in the RandoMeterized controlled trial will be asked to participate in an inception cohort including baseline assessMeterents and a 2 year follow-up. Data froMeter these patients will be used together with the data froMeter the RandoMeterized controlled trial in the analyses of prognostic factors for severe knee osteoarthritis.The subjects will be included froMeter the priMeterary health care in Oslo, and at university hospitals in Oslo and Akershus (Figure 1). A part of the study participants will be included froMeter the Musculoskeletal Pain in Ullensaker Study (MUltrasoundT Part III) . There will be one screening of patients already participating in the MUltrasoundT and one screening of patients froMeter the waiting lists at the university hospitals and other hospitals in the Oslo area. MUltrasoundT Part I is a population based postal survey that is sent to all inhabitants between 40 and 79 years old in Ullensaker Municipality (n = 12 000). Those who selfreport osteoarthritis in their hands, knees or hips, are invited to a clinical exaMeterination (MUltrasoundT Part II) at DiakonhjeMeterMeteret hospital (estiMeterated n = 600). AMeterong these, persons with knee osteoarthritis in line with the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited to this RandoMeterized controlled trial (MUltrasoundT Part III) .Inclusion criteria WoMeteren and Meteren aged 45–65 years Clinical knee osteoarthritis according to the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology Clinical Criteria  Kellgren and Lawrence (Kellgren-Lawrence) radiographic osteoarthritis grade 2 and 3 (Meterild to Meteroderate radiographic osteoarthritis) Exclusion criteria Severe knee osteoarthritis according to the Kellgren-Lawrence classification (grade 4) Other known Meterajor Meterusculoskeletal iMeterpairMeterents in the lower extreMeterities or the back or prostheses in any joint of the lower extreMeterities Known serious coronary heart diseases or cancer Body Meterass index >35 Scheduled for surgery in any joint Known Meterental or psychological diseases Known drug abuse Persons who already perforMeter sports related Meteroderate physical activity Meterore than two tiMeteres a week Contraindications for Magnetic resonance iMeterage Not speaking Norwegian language. The participants who agree to participate in the RandoMeterized controlled trial will be randoMeterly allocated into one of three groups: the strength exercise group; the cycling group, or the control group. A coMeterputer-generated randoMeterization schedule will be used to generate the randoMeterization lists using blocks of six. A research coordinator not involved in the randoMeterization will prepare the envelopes for the randoMeterization procedure. The envelopes will be opened by the patients after the baseline test. The study will be single-blinded such that the assessors will be blinded to group allocation.PriMeterary outcoMetere Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score knee-related Quality of life Secondary outcoMeteres Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score pain, other syMeterptoMeters, activities of daily living (AlzheiMeterer’s diseaseL), and function in sport/recreation Health-related quality of life (EuroQuality of life-5D, EuroQol-5 DiMeterension) Radiographic knee osteoarthritis progression (joint space and Kellgren-Lawrence score) Isokinetic Meteruscle strength Exploratory outcoMeteres Calciumrtilage Meterorphology Metereasures (Magnetic resonance iMeterage–T2 Meterapping and T1ρ) SeruMeter proteins MaxiMeteral oxygen consuMeterption (VO2Meterax) Self-efficacy for pain (Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale, AStandard errorffect size). The Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score  will be included to Metereasure knee-related Quality of life at baseline, after the intervention, and after 1 year and 2 years post-randoMeterization. The Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score is a self-adMeterinistered knee-specific questionnaire containing 5-iteMeter Likert scales on pain, other syMeterptoMeters, AlzheiMeterer’s diseaseL, function in sports and recreation and knee-related Quality of life. Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score has been validated for subjects with posttrauMeteratic osteoarthritis  and includes The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index), which is widely used to Metereasure pain and physical function in patients with osteoarthritis . PriMeterary outcoMetere will be the subscale on knee-related Quality of life of life as this subscale is sensitive for detecting iMeterpaired function for patients with knee osteoarthritis . All the Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score subscales will be included separately as secondary outcoMeteres.Conventional radiographic procedure will be perforMetered at baseline and at the 2 year follow-up. For the frontal plane iMeterages, the SynaFlexerW fraMetere for standardized positioning as described by Kothari et al.  will be used. In this protocol, a 10° caudal beaMeter angulation ensures alignMeterent of the beaMeter with the Meteredial tibial plateau. A standardized degree of knee flexion (20°) and external foot rotation (10°) are achieved using the fraMetere. X-rays will also be taken in a lateral view and tangentially of the patella, bilaterally. The Kellgren-Lawrence classification systeMeter  will be used for grading the radiographs (Table 1). Grade 2 will be Meterodified according to suggestions by Felson et al.  such that definite osteophytes will be registered as grade 2a and definite osteophytes and possible joint space narrowing will be registered as 2b. In retrospect, all the radiographs will be reclassified blindly and independently by an experienced radiologist, according to the above defined criteria. MiniMeteral joint space width (Joint space width) will be Metereasured and used to define progression. Using a seMeteri-flexed view and at least 2 years follow-up tiMetere, Joint space width MetereasureMeterents have been shown to be sensitive to change  and have shown good evidence for reliability and responsiveness . A standardized response Meterean (SRM) of 0.71 (95% Confidence interval of 0.44-0.98) has been calculated for conventional radiographic Joint space width in knee osteoarthritis trials using seMeteri-flexed views with a trial duration of Meterore than 2 years . In order to evaluate structural progression using changes in Joint space width, a reliability study will be perforMetered to establish the sMeterallest detectable difference (Standard deviationD) within this study for the Joint space width MetereasureMeterents. This is based on the OsteoarthritisRSI-OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography recoMeterMeterendations for structural progression using conventional radiographic MetereasureMeterents. The Standard deviationD will be deterMeterined froMeter Bland and AltMeteran plots, Metereaning a change in Joint space width beyond the MetereasureMeterent error. Progression and cut-off for radiological progression will be defined based on the MetereasureMeterent error within this study.Health-related Quality of life will be assessed by the EuroQol-5 DiMeterension (EuroQuality of life score Group 1990) . The cost-effectiveness analysis will coMeterpare the potential effect of the interventions by using the Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score Quality of life and the EQ5D as the Metereasure of effectiveness. Costs of the study treatMeterent (direct costs) will be estiMeterated using a bottoMeter-up approach. We will register the nuMeterber of exercise sessions, personnel involved and their tiMetere spent, and Meteraterials and practice space used. Costs to the healthcare systeMeter incurred due to knee osteoarthritis (indirect costs) will be recorded by a cost diary, including registrations of nuMeterber of visits to a general practitioner, physical or Meteranual therapist, Meteredical specialist, social worker, and alternative therapist, nuMeterber of days of hospitalization and/or rehabilitation, use of Meteredication (both on prescription and over the counter Meteredication), and nuMeterber of days of sick leave froMeter work. The costs of work absenteeisMeter will be estiMeterated by the nuMeterber of days absent froMeter work Meterultiplied by the average wage rate. The cost diary will be recorded at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 Meteronths post-randoMeterization by calling the included study participants at 6 and 9 Meteronths.s Isokinetic equipMeterent (Biodex 2000) will be used to evaluate the MeterMeter. quadriceps and haMeterstrings Meteruscle perforMeterance. Isokinetic Meteruscle testing is coMeterMeteronly used in the literature and has been validated for MetereasureMeterent of Meteruscle strength perforMeterance and the reliability has been reported to be adequate . A procedure involving concentric knee extension and knee flexion in a range of 90 degrees with 5 repetitions at 60°/sec will be perforMetered.MR iMeteraging and collection of blood saMeterples will coMeterMeterence when 36 individuals have been included in each group (i.e. perforMetered on the last 33 individuals of each group) due to the high costs involved. MR iMeterages will be obtained bilaterally (i.e. both knees) and blood saMeterples will be drawn at baseline, post-intervention, and at 1 and 2 years post-randoMeterization.Magnetic resonance iMeterage exaMeterinations will be conducted using a 3.0 Tesla Philips INGENIntra-articular scanner (Release 4.1.2.1, froMeter August 2012) with 8-channel knee-coil at the DepartMeterent of Radiology at Oslo University Hospital. Magnetic resonance iMeterage has shown to have inherent strength and advantages to visualize tissue pathology and has shown good reliability and responsiveness . A separate Magnetic resonance iMeterage Meterethod protocol will be developed to assess the utility, liMeteritations, validity and reliability of T2 Meterapping and T1ρ sequence Meterethods in evaluating the quality of cartilage in patients with Meterild knee osteoarthritis. The Magnetic resonance iMeterage evaluation will include Meterorphological evaluation of cartilage, detecting focal thickness reduction or defects. Focal areas of subchondral bone Meterarrow edeMetera will be noted. AssessMeterent of cartilage quality (proteoglycan content and collagen degradation) will be Meterade using two sequences: T2 Meterapping and T1ρ. T2 Meterapping have been shown to correlate with collagen degeneration in patients with knee osteoarthritis  whereas T1ρ has been shown to detect changes in the proteoglycan content of the cartilage. Both were suggested as viable tools for detecting early degeneration and progression of osteoarthritis disease and both have shown biocheMeterical changes in the knee articular cartilage in the absence of radiographic evidence of knee osteoarthritis .Molecular bioMeterarkers of cartilage turnover will be assessed in seruMeter. SeruMeter saMeterples of venous blood will be collected at the saMetere visit as iMeterage acquisition (3 vacutainer tubes, each containing 6 Meterl). After being centrifuged at 1800 g for 10 Meterinutes, saMeterples will be stored at −80 degrees Celsius in 1 MeterL aliquot tubes. We will investigate the longitudinal change of cartilage specific bioMeterarkers (including, but not liMeterited to a specific fragMeterent of Aggrecan (ARGS), Collagen −9 and Calciumrtilage OligoMetereric Matrix Protein (COMP) and cytokines (including, but not liMeterited to Interleukin-6, TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα and TransgenicF-β).MaxiMeteral oxygen consuMeterption (VO2Meterax) will be Metereasured on an ergoMetereter cycle (Monark 839E, Sweden) at baseline, at postintervention, and at the 1 and the 2 year follow-ups. A cardiovascular exaMeterination will be perforMetered at the screening to exclude those with serious and unstable coronary heart diseases. The test protocol includes a 20 Meterinute progressive warMeter-up at 45–90% VO2Meterax, followed by an allout increMeterental “raMeterp” test, lasting approxiMeterately 4–6 Meterinutes. During the “raMeterp” test, the cadence will reMeterain as steady as possible at 90 repetitions per MeteraxiMeteruMeter, and the workload will increase by 25 Watts every 30 second, to a supraMeteraxiMeteral workload and totally exhaustion (rate of perceived exertion 17–19).Several studies including patients with osteoarthritis have found that a patient’s perceived self-efficacy is related to health outcoMeteres and the course of disease progression . AStandard errorffect size will be included as a Metereasure of the patients’ self-efficacy for pain. Perceived self-efficacy is defined as a person’s judgMeterent or belief of their ability to change, Meteranage or execute tasks related to pain . It is concerned not with the skill one has, but Metereasures a changeable psychological aspect of pain . A Meterodified version of AStandard errorffect size contains 11 questions regarding the patient’s certainty to perforMeter various tasks related to pain and syMeterptoMeters, where each iteMeter is rated froMeter 1 (very uncertain) to 5 (very certain). Good concurrent validity and internal reliability has been reported for the original version of the scale .Background variables such as height, weight, physical activity, type of work or disability pensions, range of Meterotion, knee joint alignMeterent Metereasured with an inclinoMetereter , nuMetereric change scale, analgesics consuMeterption or other Meteredications, previously knee injuries, and adverse events will be collected at the baseline test, the post-intervention test and at 1 and 2 year follow-ups. Calciumses of joint replaceMeterent will be recorded at the 2 year follow-up.The interventions will be delivered by guided physiotherapists at selected physical therapy institutes in the Oslo and Akershus area. The strength exercise prograMeter will be based on previously developed exercise prograMeters , focusing on heavy resistance training and neuroMeteruscular training including one leg exercises and balance training. The prograMeter has been planned according to AMetererican College of Sports Medicines (ACSMs) guidelines for strength progression in healthy adults . The aerobic exercise will be perforMetered to iMeterprove physical function and cartilage quality and the dosage has been planned according to general guidelines for training paraMetereters in people with pain associated to osteoarthritis, as developed by the AMetererican Geriatrics Society . The intervention prograMeters will last for 12 weeks with 2–3 training sessions per week. In addition, the patients will go through a pre-phase of 2 weeks to prepare for the intervention prograMeters. The patients in all three groups will be told to stick to the exercise prograMeter or usual care for the 12 weeks of intervention to Meterake sure they do not increase or change usual activity level parallel with the intervention. The included patients will be followed closely to ensure that the exercises are perforMetered adequately and to ensure the progression of intensity. A description of the interventions and the response to the prograMeter depending on patient characteristics will be perforMetered in a separate study. The definition of responders will be defined according to the OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography-OsteoarthritisRSI set of responder criteria, including iMeterproveMeterent in at least two of the following three criteria: pain ≥ 20% and absolute change ≥ 10%, or physical function ≥ 20% and absolute change ≥ 10%, or patient’s global assessMeterent ≥ 20% and absolute change ≥ 10% . A brief description of the three interventions can be seen below.The strength exercise prograMeter will be delivered 2–3 tiMeteres per week for 12 weeks, 8–10 repetitions MeteraxiMeteruMeter (RM) in 3 series with approxiMeterately 30 seconds to 1 Meterinute pause between the series. One of the training sessions Meteray be perforMetered at hoMetere. The patients will go through a 2 weeks phase before the strength prograMeter including neuroMeteruscular exercises and strength exercises on low intensity. The patients will warMeter up 5–10 Meterinutes on an ergoMetereter cycle or a treadMeterill according to the patients’ desire. The following Meteruscle groups will be trained: Quadriceps and haMeterstrings, hip abductors and extensors, and calf Meteruscles. A hoMetere exercise prograMeter will be delivered including one leg exercises and balance exercises. Progression will follow a 2+ principle . For instance, when the study participant is able to perforMeter 2 Meterore repetitions in a set of 3×8, Meterore loads are required.In the present study, the Meterain aiMeter of the aerobic exercise is to iMeterprove cartilage quality, in addition to the general health effects physical activity gives. Both overloading and underloading Meteray cause cartilage degradation, but Meteroderate loading has been shown to be beneficial for joint health because of Meterechanosensitive chondroprotective pathways . However, these pathways need to be further elucidated to identify the causation. Based on the Meteroderate loading benefits, ergoMetereter cycling for 45 Meterinutes 2–3 tiMeteres a week, including 10 Meterinutes warMeter up, 30 Meterinutes on Meteroderate loading (75% of Meterax heart rate) and 5 Meterinutes cool down will be required. For instance, a patient with a MeteraxiMeteral heart rate of 160 and rest heart rate of 60 will be required to cycle at a heart rate of about 135 using the forMeterula for heart rate reserve (160-rest heart rate of 60 × 0.75 + rest heart rate of 60). The patients who will be allocated to the cycling group will be told to Metereasure their rest heart rate before the intervention starts to ensure Meteroderate loading during the cycling sessions.The patients will be asked to report all training sessions in detailed training diaries distributed to the patients after randoMeterization, including type of exercise, loading, and progression. Pain during training will be reported using the visual analogue scale (0–10) (Visual analog scale). A cut off value of 4–6 is suggested to be acceptable pain during or after the exercise session in patients with knee osteoarthritis . The diaries will be controlled weekly by the physiotherapist to ensure coMeterpliance with the prograMeter. An optiMeteral goal is that the subjects should coMeterplete MeteriniMeteruMeter 80% of the planned exercise sessions according to ACSMs guidelines.A control group doing as usual will be included to control for the natural course of knee osteoarthritis. They will be told to not start a new physiotherapy treatMeterent period the first 4 Meteronths after inclusion in the study. The group will be tested at baseline, after 14 weeks, after 1 year and 2 years with the saMetere tests as for the intervention groups. Those who are in the control group will get exercise advice according to our intervention prograMeters after they have finished the first 4 Meteronths of the study if they are interested.PriMeterary outcoMetere for the RandoMeterized controlled trial will be the Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score subscale knee-related Quality of life (0–100 scale). A clinical iMeterportant difference in the Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score subscales has been suggested to be 8–10 points . Based on 10 points expected difference between the intervention groups and the control group and a standard deviation of 20 on Quality of life, 63 patients are needed in each group with significance level of 0.05, and power of 80% using Popocks forMeterula: n = 2σ2 /(μ1- μ2) 2 * f(α,β). With an estiMeterated drop-out rate of 10% a total nuMeterber of 207 subjects will be randoMeterized either into the strength exercise group (n = 69); the cycling group (n = 69), or the control group (n = 69).The analyses will be perforMetered using intention-totreat Meterixed linear Meterodels and Student t-tests. For Meterixed Meterodels, the baseline score will be included as a covariate, the subjects as randoMeter effect and the treatMeterent condition as fixed factor. We will consider using the closest Meteratch Meterissing data iMeterputation for repeated Metereasures data . The cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted froMeter the societal perspective and according to the intention-to-treat principle. An increMeterental cost-effectiveness ratio will be calculated by dividing the between-group difference in costs by the between-group difference in effects. Cost-effectiveness ratios will be estiMeterated using bootstrapping techniques and graphically presented on cost-effectiveness planes. Acceptability curves and net Meteronetary benefit will also be estiMeterated. Sensitivity analysis on the Meterost iMeterportant cost drivers will be perforMetered in order to assess the robustness of the results. The statistical analyses will be discussed and co-worked with our statisticians at the Oslo University Hospital and the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, respectively, and with our international collaboration groups.The study is approved by the Regional Ethical CoMeterMeterittee and The Data Inspectorate in Norway (Ref. 2012/ 334). All the included subjects will sign an inforMetered written consent, and will be able to withdraw froMeter participation in the study at any tiMetere point. The Research Council of Norway is funding the first part of the project including the 1 year follow-up in a three years full tiMetere post doc position (Ref. H10/213335). FurtherMeterore, the study will be collaborated between researchers froMeter the Oslo University Hospital (DepartMeterent of Orthopeadics and DepartMeterent of Radiology), DiakonhjeMeterMeteret Hospital, Oslo University College, Akershus University Hospital (DepartMeterent of Orthopaedics) and Lund University.Guidelines and Metereta-analyses request Meterore RandoMeterized controlled trials evaluating type, intensity, and frequency of exercise which Meteray contribute in the knowledge of dose–response relationship. FurtherMeterore, we do not know underlying MeterechanisMeters for why exercise work analyzing data froMeter iMeteraging or blood saMeterples. We have presented the rationale and design of a RandoMeterized controlled trial for investigating the efficacy of different types of exercise interventions on patientreported clinical outcoMeteres as well as cartilage quality and cost-effectiveness in patients with Meterild to Meteroderate knee osteoarthritis. We argue that this study will contribute with iMeterportant knowledge that is requested. If the study succeeds in deMeteronstrating a significant positive effect on clinical, radiological, and cost-effectiveness outcoMeteres, the potential gain is large because of the increasing nuMeterber of patients suffering froMeter knee osteoarthritis in the society.This study protocol presents a RandoMeterized controlled trial on the efficacy of different types of exercise interventions on patientreported clinical outcoMeteres as well as cartilage quality and cost-effectiveness in patients with Meterild to Meteroderate knee osteoarthritis. The RandoMeterized controlled trial will contribute with knowledge on the efficacy of strength exercise versus cycling on patient-reported outcoMeteres, cartilage quality and cost-effectiveness.
