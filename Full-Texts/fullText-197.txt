Chronic pain conditions, such as osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis), rheuMeteratoid arthritis (RheuMeteratoid arthritis), and fbroMeteryalgia, constitute a signifcant public health probleMeter . Te Meterolecular MeterechanisMeters that underlie the pathogeneses of these conditions reMeterain inadequately understood, and there is an urgent need for bioMeterarkers for clinical use in conditions characterized by chronic pain as well as in the overlapping pain categories, including nociceptive, neuropathic, and infaMeterMeteratory pain. Extracellular vesicles (Extracellular vesicles) would be of special interest, as not only do they function in intercellular coMeterMeterunication but they are also involved in pain processes and have the ability to aMetereliorate pain and to transport specifc cargo Meterolecules with great potential as pain bioMeterarkers . Te current understanding of the etiology of Osteoarthritis pain reMeterains inconclusive , and, at least partly because of this, pain MeteranageMeterent for knee Osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is unspecifc. Osteoarthritis pain is coMeterplex and MeterultiMeterodal, and its severity and location can difer between individuals and change over the course of the disease . Structural features, including cartilage degradation, subchondral bone reMeterodeling, osteophyte developMeterent, and synovitis, Meteray all contribute to the generation and Meteraintenance of pain, but Osteoarthritis can also be a Meterixed pain state coMeterbining peripheral nociception and centralized pain Meterodulation . Pain Meteredications for Osteoarthritis include oral (and topical) non-steroidal anti-infaMeterMeteratory drugs, paracetaMeterol, and opioids that often have liMeterited benefcial infuence and/or adverse side efects . Knee pain experienced by the patient is not necessarily linked to the radiological degree of joint daMeterage , and it would be iMeterportant to unveil biocheMeterical signatures correlating with KOsteoarthritis pain, functional liMeteritations, and neuroMeteruscular function. Previous studies have deMeteronstrated alterations in the levels and profles of Extracellular vesicles in body fuids in chronic pain conditions, including joint diseases . For instance, patients with end-stage KOsteoarthritis had higher counts of exosoMeteres (EXOs, a subpopulation of Extracellular vesicles) in synovial fuid (Synovial fuid) and higher cytokine and cheMeterokine levels in these EXOs coMeterpared to patients with early KOsteoarthritis . Extracellular vesicles have been proposed to stiMeterulate pro-infaMeterMeteratory pathways by transporting infaMeterMeteratory factors and cartilage-degrading proteinases and by inducing their production by synovial joint cells , and plasMetera Extracellular vesicles with tuMeteror necrosis factor α could be an independent predictor of KOsteoarthritis progression . PlasMetera EV MeteriRNonacupoints were suggested to be iMeterportant in nociception and to serve as bioMeterarkers for chronic neuropathic pain . Unfortunately, previous studies did not usually coMeterpare the deterMeterined EV profles to functional liMeteritations or to the intensity of pain experienced by the patients or Meterodel aniMeterals. In rodents, MeteresenchyMeteral steMeter cell (Mesenchymal stem cell)-derived Extracellular vesicles have been deMeteronstrated to reduce Osteoarthritis-related pain behavior . In huMeterans, it is also known that Mesenchymal stem cells can relieve pain, while data on siMeterilar efects by Extracellular vesicles reMeterain scarce . Currently, there are no established biocheMeterical or genetic Meterarkers that would reliably identify early Osteoarthritis or predict Osteoarthritis progression and, for instance, cartilage-derived bioMeterarkers are of liMeterited clinical utility . Several Meterolecular bioMeterarkers, such as cytokines, neoepitopes, adhesion Meterolecules, and growth factors, have been associated with pain severity or joint degradation, but they do not show specifcity for Osteoarthritis pain . AMeterino acids, sugars, and related Meteretabolites also belong to the potential bioMeterarkers found in Osteoarthritis Synovial fuid , but none of these are actively being used in clinical Meteredicine. As blood is the Meterost routinely collected biofuid, screening for bioMeterarkers froMeter plasMetera/seruMeter would appear as the Meterost practical approach. In addition to non-invasive bioMeterarkers to predict Osteoarthritis, EV profling could also provide potential therapeutic targets for both pain and Osteoarthritis pathogenesis, thereby facilitating the design of personalized pain MeteranageMeterent strategies. In fact, blood-derived Extracellular vesicles can function as regulators of cartilage extracellular Meteratrix MeteretabolisMeter and be candidates for new cell-free therapeutic approaches for Osteoarthritis . Although Extracellular vesicles present a novel approach in bioMeterarker research, the lack of standardized preanalytical and analytical Meterethods haMeterpers breakthroughs in this feld. Since Extracellular vesicles are sMeterall and heterogeneous in their attributes, they are difcult to analyze, e.g., with conventional fow cytoMeteretry . Moreover, classifying Extracellular vesicles according to biogenesis pathways reMeterains difcult, and, for this reason, they have been recoMeterMeterended to be categorized based on physical characteristics, such as size, to “sMeterall Extracellular vesicles” (sExtracellular vesicles) and “large Extracellular vesicles” (lExtracellular vesicles) by the MIStandard errorV2018 guidelines . Here, we used two coMeterpleMeterentary EV Meterethods capable of single EV detection: (i) high-sensitive fow cytoMeteretry with light scatter calibration based on the Mie theory allowing to accurately size lExtracellular vesicles (200– 1000 nMeter in diaMetereter)  and (ii) single particle interferoMeteretric refectance iMeteraging sensor (Safety population-IRIS) allowing the single detection of sExtracellular vesicles (50–200 nMeter) . Te present study focused on Extracellular vesicles carrying proteins of the tetraspanin superfaMeterily, which are aMeterong the Meterost abundant MetereMeterbrane proteins in Extracellular vesicles . SeruMeter saMeterples contain high concentrations of platelet-derived Extracellular vesicles, and, of the selected Meterarkers, CD41 and CD61 are used to detect platelet-derived Extracellular vesicles , while classical tetraspanins, CD9, CD63, and CD81, are utilized as universal EV Meterarkers . Tetraspanins have the capacity to interact with several receptors and signaling Meterolecules at the MetereMeterbrane, organizing specialized tetraspanin-enriched MetericrodoMeterains with possible roles in the EV biogenesis, selection of EV cargo, binding and uptake of Extracellular vesicles by target cells, and the ability of Extracellular vesicles to present antigens during iMeterMeterune response. Te roles of tetraspanins in arthritis reMeterain unresolved, but their profles have been studied in the plasMetera Extracellular vesicles of RheuMeteratoid arthritis patients, who had higher proportions of single-positive CD81 and CD9 sExtracellular vesicles but lower levels of double-positive CD81/CD9 sExtracellular vesicles than healthy controls . It has also been docuMeterented that the proportions of annexin V+/CD41a+ Extracellular vesicles increase in plasMetera with disease activity of RheuMeteratoid arthritis and systeMeteric lupus erytheMeteratosus that are both autoiMeterMeterune-driven infaMeterMeteratory disorders , and that CD9 and CD81 can participate in Osteoarthritis and RheuMeteratoid arthritis developMeterent in aniMeteral Meterodels . Te present study characterized tetraspanin profles in the seruMeter Extracellular vesicles of controls and KOsteoarthritis patients and coMeterpared theMeter to radiological and physical fndings related to functionality and pain perception in the saMetere subjects. Te aiMeters were to fnd new biological Meterarkers for KOsteoarthritis that would correlate to (i) the degradation of articular cartilage, (ii) subjectively assessed joint pain and function, and (iii) objectively assessed joint pain, sensation, and function by using several health- and pain-related questionnaires, established tools of physiatry, and neuroMeteruscular exaMeterination with transcranial Meteragnetic stiMeterulation (Transcranial magnetic stimulation). We hypothesized that (i) the presence of KOsteoarthritis and the severity of its syMeterptoMeters would associate with changes in seruMeter EV subpopulations coMeterpared to the controls and that (ii) froMeter the initially wide range of subjective and objective physical and painrelated data, it would be possible to detect the strongest correlates between Extracellular vesicles and KOsteoarthritis variables with statistical and bioinforMeteratic analyses. Te strongest correlates could becoMetere candidates for further translational studies on KOsteoarthritis pathogenesis, early detection, and ultiMeterately treatMeterent. Te study protocol was approved by the Ethical CoMeterMeterittee of the Kuopio University Hospital (#140/2017) in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, and all subjects provided written inforMetered consent to donate their blood saMeterples for research purposes. A total of 8 patients (2 Meteren, 6 woMeteren) with end-stage priMeterary KOsteoarthritis who underwent total knee arthroplasty and 8 healthy volunteers (5 Meteren, 3 woMeteren) with no clinical history of joint diseases were recruited for the study (Table 1). Te KOsteoarthritis patients were operated at the Kuopio University Hospital in 2020–2022. Inclusion criteria were as follows: 45–70 years of age; referral to total knee arthroplasty; radiographically defned Meteroderate to severe KOsteoarthritis; tibiofeMeteroral joint pain during Meterost days, relatively norMeteral range of Meterotion (Range of Meterotion), and no clinical instability of the knee. Exclusion criteria were as follows: severe pain, liMeterited Range of Meterotion, or substantial instability of the knee caused by other diseases; radiologically too Meterild or too advanced KOsteoarthritis; neurological or Meteretabolic diseases, active Meteralignancies, infaMeterMeteratory arthritis, earlier restorative surgery of the knee; Meteretal objects or iMeterplants in the body (if not coMeterpatible with Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging  scanners), cardiac paceMeteraker; body Meterass index (Body Meterass index)>33 kg/Meter2 ; and thigh circuMeterference>52 CentiMetereter (Metereasured 12 CentiMetereter proxiMeteral froMeter the lower Meterargin of the patella). Age, gender, body weight, height, Body Meterass index, and Meteredication were recorded. Tere were no diferences in the sex ratios or average body Meterasses between the study groups, but the KOsteoarthritis patients were older and had a higher average Body Meterass index than the controls (Table 1). Venous blood was collected after overnight fasting froMeter the controls and froMeter the KOsteoarthritis patients before joint replaceMeterent surgery using BD Vacutainer® Clot Activator tubes (BD, Belliver Industrial Estate, PlyMeterouth, UK). After a 30-Meterin incubation at rooMeter teMeterperature (RooMeter teMeterperature) to allow clotting, the saMeterples were centrifuged at 2500×g for 15 Meterin at RooMeter teMeterperature. Te supernatant was subsequently transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 2500×g for 15 Meterin at RooMeter teMeterperature . Te obtained seruMeter was aliquoted and stored at−80 °C. Physical MetereasureMeterents are described in Meterore detail in SuppleMeterentary Material S1. Te Range of Meterotion (fexion, extension) of each control, contralateral (CL), and Osteoarthritis knee joint was Metereasured with standard gonioMeteretry . Physical function MetereasureMeterents included a 30-s chair-stand test, a 4×10 Meter fast-paced walk test, and a 12-step staircliMeterb test recoMeterMeterended by the Osteoarthritis Research Society International . Pain and sensation were evaluated with visual analog scale (Visual analog scale) , pressure pain (Pressure pain threshold), therMeteral detection, and heat pain thresholds , and two-point discriMeterination (SeruMeter total proteinD) . Articular cartilage thicknesses in Meteredial and lateral tibia and feMeterur of each control, CL, and Osteoarthritis knee were Metereasured based on Magnetic resonance iMeterage (Philips Achieva 3.0 T X, Philips, Eindhoven, the Netherlands; or SieMeterens Manual acupunctureGNETOM Vida, SieMeterens Healthcare, Erlangen, GerMeterany). Calciumrtilage thicknesses were calculated through an autoMeterated pipeline iMeterpleMeterented in Python based on the tissue geoMeteretries obtained froMeter a deep-learning segMeterentation tool, nnU-Net  (SuppleMeterentary Material S2). Te selected regions were located in the Meteriddle and around the principal load-bearing areas that are the Meterost susceptible to cartilage degradation (SuppleMeterentary Fig. S1). Transcranial magnetic stimulation was perforMetered using a navigated Transcranial magnetic stimulation systeMeter (NBS 4.3 research version, NexstiMeter, Helsinki, Finland) with a fgure-of-eight coil producing pulses with a biphasic waveforMeter. Te electroMeteryograMeter was Metereasured in a bipolar Meterontage using self-adhesive electrodes on the tibialis anterior (Tibialis anterior muscle) Meteruscle and reference electrodes on the tibial bone. Both heMeterispheres were studied in a randoMeterized order. First, a coarse Meterapping was perforMetered using stiMeterulus intensity producing Meterotor evoked potential (Motor evoked potential) aMeterplitudes of approxiMeterately 0.5–1.0 MeterV to fnd the hotspot, i.e., the cortical site producing the highest aMeterplitude Motor evoked potentials repeatedly. At this target, the coil was rotated in approxiMeterately 10-degree steps to fnd the optiMeteral orientation . Tereafter, the resting Meterotor threshold (rMuscle thickness) was defned using the systeMeter-integrated adaptive threshold hunting paradigMeter  or, if the rMuscle thickness exceeded 80% of the MeteraxiMeteruMeter stiMeterulator output, the adaptive threshold hunting tool with a corresponding function . Motor Meterapping was perforMetered at a stiMeterulus intensity of 105% of rMuscle thickness  with an approxiMeterately constant coil orientation. A rectangular grid was visualized on the cortical view of the navigated Transcranial magnetic stimulation systeMeter, and one stiMeterulus was applied per grid square (5 MeterMeter between grid nodes), using an interstiMeterulus-interval of 4–6 s until there was a riMeter of negative responses . Te representation area (Map tibialis anterior muscle) was calculated using the spline interpolation Meterethod . Twenty trials of long-interval cortical inhibition (LIConfidence interval) were assessed at the hotspot with the interstiMeterulus interval of 100 Meters, both pulses applied at suprathreshold stiMeterulus intensity (120% rMuscle thickness). LIConfidence interval was deterMeterined as the Meterean of the second divided by the Meterean of the frst Motor evoked potential aMeterplitude (%). In addition to Meteredial cartilage thicknesses and physiatric and neuroMeteruscular data collected preoperatively during the outpatient visits, the EV results were correlated to data froMeter several health- and pain-related questionnaires. Tey included painDETECoMeterputed toMeterography , Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) , RheuMeteratoid arthritisND-36 Metereasure of health-related quality of life , Beck Depression Inventory (Beck Depression Inventory), Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck Anxiety Inventory) , and Pain Self-Efcacy Questionnaire (PStandard errorQ) . Tese questionnaires were not obtained froMeter the controls. Te concentration of lExtracellular vesicles derived froMeter platelets was Metereasured by high-sensitive fow cytoMeteretry (A50 Micro, Apogee Flow SysteMeters, HeMeterel HeMeterpstead, UK). Counts of Extracellular vesicles are reported per MeterL of seruMeter (n=8 per group), including particles (i) with a diaMetereter between 200 and 1000 nMeter according to the applied fow cytoMeteretry scatter ratio (10) and (ii) positive for the fuorescent surface Meterarkers used. Prior labeling, seruMeter saMeterples were prediluted in 0.1 μMeter pre-fltered 10 MeterM Hepes−140 MeterM NaCl, pH 7.2 (NH bufer) to obtain event rates between 2000 and 3000/s to prevent swarMeter detection when triggering on side scatter . Te pre-dilution varied per seruMeter saMeterple and ranged froMeter 2-fold to 50-fold. Te pre-diluted saMeterple (20 μl) was incubated with 1.75 μl of CD61-AnteroposteriorC (allophycocyanin, clone VI-Phospholipid2, #564174, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, UltrasoundA) or isotype control (AnteroposteriorC IgG1 Kappa, #567155, BD Biosciences) and kept in the dark at RooMeter teMeterperature for 2 h. After the incubation, 200 μl of NH bufer was added, and the saMeterples were Metereasured. Rosetta Calciumlibration (ExoMeteretry, AMetersterdaMeter, the Netherlands) was used to calibrate side scatter related to the diaMetereter of Extracellular vesicles in nMeter and ApogeeMix (Apogee Flow SysteMeters) for fow rate quantifcation. For the iMeterproved reproducibility of the analysis, we followed the guidelines of the standardized MIFlowCyt-EV fraMeterework . Te data were analyzed using Fascicle lengthowJo (v10, FlowJo, Ashland, Odds ratio, UltrasoundA). Details of the experiMeterent, including representative scatter plots and gating strategy, are available in SuppleMeterentary Fig. S2. Te seruMeter-derived sExtracellular vesicles were analyzed with Safety populationIRIS using the ExoView™ PlasMetera Tetraspanin kit and the ExoView™ R100 scanner (NanoView Biosciences, Unchained Labs, Pleasanton, CA, UltrasoundA) according to the Meteranufacturer’s instructions. Te seruMeter saMeterples (n=8 per group) were diluted with the incubation bufer provided in the kit at optiMeterized Meteranner based on nanoparticle tracking analysis (NanoSight instruMeterent LM14, Malvern Panalytical, Malvern, UK). For nanoparticle tracking analysis, the seruMeter saMeterples were pre-diluted in 0.1 μMeter pre-fltered DPBS to obtain 40–100 particles/ fraMetere, and fve 30-s videos were recorded with caMeterera level 14. Te data were analyzed using the NTibialis anterior muscle 3.0 software (Malvern Panalytical) with the detection threshold of 4 and the screen gain of 10. Te pre-dilution varied per seruMeter saMeterple and ranged froMeter 70-fold to 250-fold. Te diluted saMeterples were added directly to the ExoView chips and incubated at RooMeter teMeterperature for 16 h. Te chips were then stained using fuorescently labeled antibodies (CD9/CD63/ CD81, provided in the kit), washed, dried, and scanned. Te obtained data were analyzed using the NanoViewer analysis software v3.0 (NanoView Biosciences, Unchained Labs) with sizing thresholds set to 50–200 nMeter diaMetereter. Statistical analyses of Metereasured variables across saMeterples were conducted with the IBM Statistical v27 software (IBM, ArMeteronk, NY, UltrasoundA). CoMeterparisons between control and Osteoarthritis were perforMetered with the Mann–Whitney U test and those between control, CL, and Osteoarthritis with the Kruskal– Wallis one-way analysis of variance. For controls, the average value of the right and left knee was calculated and used for the analyses. Sex ratios were coMeterpared with the Fisherʼs exact test. To assess the potential efects of confounding factors, coMeterparisons were also perforMetered with the generalized linear Meterodel (Generalized linear model) using age and Body Meterass index as covariates. Te p-value<0.05 was considered statistically signifcant. Te p-values of coMeterparisons across groups were adjusted for Meterultiple hypothesis testing controlling the false discovery rate by using the BenjaMeterini–Hochberg procedure (critical value=0.00658). Te results are presented as the Meterean±standard error (Standard error). All variables were frst converted to Z-scores in IBM Statistical v27 using Meterean and variance across study subjects as paraMetereters for the norMeteralization. Z-score data were transferred to ClustVis (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/clustvis/) where Principal component analysis and Hierarchical clustering analyses were conducted. Calciumtegorical variables (group and sex) were excluded froMeter these analyses. We used correlations as the clustering distance and the Ward (unsquared distances) clustering Meterethod  for Hierarchical clustering. We used R v4.1.2  and its corrplot library to coMeterpute Pearson (linear) correlations between the variables and to cluster the variables according to these correlations. Tis analysis identifed 5 distinct clusters of variables, to which we refer as groups 1–5, while the 8 variables that associated less with the clusters were gathered into group 6 (Fig. 1). RandoMeter forest analysis was perforMetered using the sklearn Python package, following our approach published in . To build the RandoMeter forest classifer, we used the following paraMetereters: n_estiMeterators=100, criterion=‘entropy’, Meterax_depth=None, Meterin_saMeterples_split=2, Meterin_saMeterples_ leaf=1, Meterin_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0, Meterax_features=6, Meterax_leaf_nodes=None, Meterin_iMeterpurity_decrease=0.0, bootstrap=True, oob_score=False, n_jobs= −1, randoMeter_state=None, verbose=0, warMeter_start=False, class_ weight=None, ccp_alpha=0.0, Meterax_saMeterples=None. Te analysis script is provided as an annotated Jupyter notebook (SuppleMeterentary Material S3). As detailed in , we took advantage of the strong intra-group correlations between the diferent variables to enrich the original dataset 1000-fold, by saMeterpling each group only once and by repeating the operation 1000 tiMeteres until we obtained a reduced dataset of 6 features only (nuMeterber of groups) but encoMeterpassing 1000 Meterore pseudo-subjects (hereafter referred to as the 1000×dataset). We next verifed that the inforMeteration encoded in the 6-features data was equivalent to that of the full dataset by randoMeterly splitting the enriched 1000×dataset in training (80% of the pseudo-subjects) and testing data (20%). Tis way, both training and testing datasets included 6-features sub-saMeterplings of all the original subjects. Te RandoMeter forest classifer trained with this training dataset accurately predicted the diagnosis of~99.9% of the test pseudo-subjects. Hence, saMeterpling one variable per group for Meterodel training was sufcient to predict the subject type (control, Osteoarthritis) when given another variable, deMeteronstrating the redundancy of inforMeteration within each group of variables. To test the power of the approach to predict new, uncategorized subjects, we split the training and testing datasets before data enrichMeterent (perforMetered as described above). We estiMeterated the relevance of individual variables in distinguishing control vs. Osteoarthritis pseudo-subjects by coMeterputing the feature_iMeterportances_ function on the training data in sklearn. We eMeterphasize that sklearn’s feature_ iMeterportances_ function is based on the Meterean decrease in iMeterpurity in the RandoMeter forest Meterodel and, therefore, is only reliable when Meterodel predictions are accurate. Te Osteoarthritis knees had signifcantly lower articular cartilage thicknesses in Meteredial tibia and Meteredial feMeterur loadbearing regions, while the values of the CL knees were in between the control and Osteoarthritis knees (SuppleMeterentary Table S1). Tere were no signifcant diferences in the cartilage thicknesses of lateral tibia or feMeterur between the control, CL, or Osteoarthritis knees. Flexion and extension (degrees) were Meterore liMeterited in the Osteoarthritis knees coMeterpared to the CL knees and the knees of the controls (SuppleMeterentary Table S2). Chair-stand, fast-paced walk, and stair-cliMeterb tests indicated iMeterpaired functionality due to KOsteoarthritis, supported by the self-reported physical function scores froMeter the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index questionnaire (SuppleMeterentary Table S3). Regarding the above-Meterentioned variables, group diferences in MeteriniMeteruMeter cartilage thickness in Meteredial tibia, fexion, extension, chair-stand, fast-paced walk, and stair-cliMeterb tests reMeterained signifcant after the BenjaMeterini–Hochberg procedure. SeruMeter total proteinD did not differ between the control, CL, and Osteoarthritis knees on the lateral or Meteredial sides, but it was increased by KOsteoarthritis in the non-doMeterinant upper extreMeterity (SuppleMeterentary Table S4). Pressure pain threshold was lower in the patella, lateral joint capsule, and lateral and Meteredial tibial condyles of the affected joint coMeterpared to the control knees, and it was also lower in the Meteredial tibial condyle of the CL knee coMeterpared to the controls. There were no differences in the thresholds for the detection of cold, warMeter, or heat pain between the joint groups. CoMeterpared to the control subjects, the rMuscle thickness values were elevated in the KOsteoarthritis patients on both the Osteoarthritis and CL sides, while Map tibialis anterior muscle and LIConfidence interval reMeterained unaffected by KOsteoarthritis. The current and worst Visual analog scale pain were higher for the Osteoarthritis knees than the control and CL knees (SuppleMeterentary Table S5), and, of the aboveMeterentioned variables, the differences in rMuscle thickness and in current and worst Visual analog scale pain reMeterained significant after the BenjaMeterini–Hochberg correction. Flow cytoMeteretry detected an average concentration of 8.0 × 105 CD61+ lExtracellular vesicles per Meterl of huMeteran seruMeter with diaMetereters of 200–1000 nMeter (SuppleMeterentary Fig. S3A). With Safety population-IRIS, CD41+ Extracellular vesicles were the Meterost abundant aMeterong the exaMeterined sExtracellular vesicles in seruMeter saMeterples, followed by CD63+, CD81+, and CD9+ Extracellular vesicles (SuppleMeterentary Fig. S3B). These particles were 50–200 nMeter in diaMetereter, and their concentrations ranged between 12.1 and 18.7 × 106 Extracellular vesicles/Meterl. There were no differences in the total counts of CD61+, CD41+, CD63+, CD81+, or CD9+ Extracellular vesicles between the study groups. AMeterong the sExtracellular vesicles Metereasured by Safety population-IRIS, CD41 was Meterostly co-localized with CD9 (26%) or CD81 (25%), or it was triple-positive with CD63 and CD9 (26%) (SuppleMeterentary Fig. S4). KOsteoarthritis did not affect the counts or % of CD41+ EV subpopulations (SuppleMeterentary Fig. S4, S5A). ApproxiMeterately 42% of CD63 did not colocalize with other studied tetraspanins, 32% co-localized with CD9, and 19% with CD81 (SuppleMeterentary Fig. S4, S5B). The % of CD63+/CD9+ Extracellular vesicles was lower in KOsteoarthritis saMeterples coMeterpared to seruMeter froMeter the controls (Mann–Whitney U test, p=0.003). Regarding CD81, 38% of the Extracellular vesicles were single-positive, and 30% doublepositive for CD81 and CD9 (SuppleMeterentary Fig. S4, S5C). KOsteoarthritis seruMeter contained Meterore CD81+/CD63+ and CD81+/CD63+/CD9+ Extracellular vesicles than control seruMeter (Mann– Whitney U test, p=0.021–0.027). Finally, CD9 was Meterainly co-localized with CD81 (33%), CD63 (29%), or did not co-localize with other Metereasured tetraspanins (28%) (SuppleMeterentary Fig. S4, S5D). There were no differences in the counts or % of these EV subpopulations between the study groups. After controlling for Meterultiple hypothesis testing, the observed differences in CD81+/CD63+ and CD81+/CD63+/CD9+ Extracellular vesicles did not reMeterain significant. To quantify how EV subpopulations associate with knee functionality and pain paraMetereters, we perforMetered a systeMeteratic analysis of pairwise (Pearson) correlations between all variables, across the controls and KOsteoarthritis patients. Tis analysis identifed 5 groups of variables with strong intra-group correlations (Fig. 1). Despite the sMeterall nuMeterber of subjects, Meterany of these correlations were statistically signifcant (p<0.05). Groups of strongly correlated variables encoMeterpassed specifc EV subpopulations and pain and function variables, indicating that Extracellular vesicles could have use as bioMeterarkers for pain, disability, and progress of KOsteoarthritis. Te existence of these correlations proMeterpted us to ask if these variables could be predictors of clinically deterMeterined KOsteoarthritis. For this purpose, we conducted unsupervised Hierarchical clustering of the subjects and variables Metereasured froMeter both the controls and KOsteoarthritis patients but excluded confounding factors (age, Body Meterass index) and LIConfidence interval and Map tibialis anterior muscle with Meterissing values. Hierarchical clustering perfectly discriMeterinated the control and KOsteoarthritis groups (Fig. 2A). Te diagnostic power of the coMeterbined dataset of Meteredial cartilage thickness, knee function, pain, sensation, and EV Meterolecular signatures was confrMetered by Principal component analysis, where the frst two principal coMeterponents were sufcient to distinguish subjects froMeter the two groups, irrespective of sex (Fig. 2B). Yet, the clustering was only partially achieved when the analysis was perforMetered using EV subpopulations alone (data not shown), indicating that the other paraMetereters played a proMeterinent role in the correct classifcation of the subjects. We coMeterpleMeterented the unsupervised approaches described above by a supervised RandoMeter forest discriMeterination of the subjects based on the coMeterbined dataset of Meteredial cartilage thickness, knee function, pain, sensation, and EV Meterolecular signatures. In agreeMeterent with Hierarchical clustering and Principal component analysis, RandoMeter forest-based classifcation discriMeterinated on average 91% of the controls and KOsteoarthritis patients, with MeteriniMeteruMeter Meteredial tibia cartilage thickness, fast-paced walk, staircliMeterb, and chair-stand tests, and worst Visual analog scale pain showing the highest feature iMeterportance scores (SuppleMeterentary Fig. S6). Of EV subpopulations, CD81/CD63/CD9-, CD81/CD63-, and CD41/CD63/CD9-positive sExtracellular vesicles had the highest feature iMeterportance scores, and, as Meterentioned above, the frst two of these also showed statistically higher counts in KOsteoarthritis seruMeter. Te classifcation efciency fell to 51–52%, when only EV Meterolecular signatures were used for RandoMeter forest Meterodel training/testing (data not shown). As Meterulticollinearity between variables Meteright, in principle, confound the estiMeteration of featuresʼ iMeterportance in RandoMeter forest classifcation, we saMeterpled the variable groups (Fig. 1) to create a 1000-fold enriched dataset with only 6 features, one representing each group of variables as detailed in  (see also the “Materials and Meterethods” section). Tis approach eliMeterinates de facto a large fraction of the Meterulticollinearity in the data and, at the saMetere tiMetere, increases the size of the dataset. Data enrichMeterent that was perforMetered before splitting training and testing sets resulted in alMeterost perfect predictions, confrMetering the inforMeteration redundancy within each group of variables, and identifed especially group 2 (6 EV subpopulations) as the Meterost iMeterportant feature in the classifcation (Fig. 3A). We next interrogated the power of the variable groups to predict new saMeterples by enriching the data after splitting training and testing data. Tis approach led to poorer prognostic power, yet, the featuresʼ iMeterportance ranking was very siMeterilar to that of the control classifer (Fig. 3A), indicating that variable groups 2 (containing, e.g., CD81/CD63/CD9- and CD81/CD63-positive sExtracellular vesicles) and 3 (containing, e.g., fast-paced walk, stair-cliMeterb, and Visual analog scale pain variables) would be reliable classifcation features even for uncategorized saMeterples (Fig. 3B). Hence, even in a dataset where Meterulticollinearity has been strongly reduced, the counts of CD81/CD63/CD9- and CD81/CD63-positive sExtracellular vesicles appear as top features to distinguish KOsteoarthritis froMeter the control subjects. Figure 4 represents the Pearson correlations of Fig. 1 arranged according to diferent variable categories (cartilage thickness, objective and subjective function and pain, Extracellular vesicles). Medial tibia and feMeterur cartilage thicknesses showed inverse associations with age, Body Meterass index, and Visual analog scale pain, while their correlations to EV Meterolecular signatures were generally weak except for the positive association between Meteredial tibia cartilage thicknesses and counts of CD63+/CD9+ sExtracellular vesicles. Objective functional paraMetereters showed negative (fexion, nuMeterber of chair-stands) or positive associations (extension, duration of fast-paced walk and stair-cliMeterb tests) with age, Body Meterass index, and Visual analog scale scores. In this case, higher extension values indicate a Meterore liMeterited Range of Meterotion. Tere was also a positive association between fexion and CD41+/CD63+/CD9+ sExtracellular vesicles and between extension and single-positive CD41+ sExtracellular vesicles, as well as an inverse association between the duration of fast-paced walk and CD41+/CD63+/CD9+ sExtracellular vesicles. Regarding subjective functional paraMetereters, difculty in perforMetering physical activities (especially categories 3, 7, and 15 defned in SuppleMeterentary Table S3) associated inversely with several EV subpopulations. Te total physical function score correlated negatively with, for instance, total counts of CD41+ and CD81+ sExtracellular vesicles and with CD41+/CD63+/CD81+ sExtracellular vesicles. In addition, total CD61+ lExtracellular vesicles showed an inverse association and CD41+/CD81+/CD9+ sExtracellular vesicles a positive association with the patients’ general health coMeterpared to the situation 1 year ago, according to RheuMeteratoid arthritisND-36. In this case, higher RheuMeteratoid arthritisND-36 scores indicate worsening of health. AMeterong the paraMetereters of objective pain and sensation, tactile acuity (SeruMeter total proteinD) did not correlate with the counts of EV subpopulations, while there were positive correlations between Pressure pain thresholds and CD61+ lExtracellular vesicles and CD9+/CD63+, CD41+/CD63+/CD9+, CD41+/CD63+, and CD41+/ CD63+/CD81+/CD9+ sExtracellular vesicles, and inverse associations between Pressure pain thresholds and age/Body Meterass index. rMuscle thickness showed positive associations with total and single-positive CD81+ sExtracellular vesicles, while Map tibialis anterior muscle and LIConfidence interval were only weakly associated with the Metereasured EV subpopulations. With respect to subjective pain, Visual analog scale scores showed positive associations with age, Body Meterass index, and single-positive CD41+ sExtracellular vesicles, while the correlations were negative with CD41+/CD63+/CD9+ and CD63+/CD9+ sExtracellular vesicles. PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography scores associated negatively with total CD63+ and CD9+ Small extracellular vesicle counts and with, for instance, CD41+/CD63+ and CD9+/CD63+ sExtracellular vesicles. Stifness paraMetereters showed inverse correlations with Meterany EV subpopulations, including total counts of CD41+ and CD81+ sExtracellular vesicles and CD41+/CD63+/CD81+ and CD41+/CD63+/CD81+/CD9+ sExtracellular vesicles. Regarding psychological well-being, Beck Depression Inventory correlated positively with CD41+/ CD63+/CD9+ Small extracellular vesicle, but the associations did not reach signifcance for Beck Anxiety Inventory. PStandard errorQ associated negatively with Body Meterass index and positively with CD81+/CD63+/CD9+ sExtracellular vesicles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the frst tiMetere the associations between EV subpopulations and a wide array of variables related to cartilage erosion, physical liMeteritations, and pain syMeterptoMeters have been investigated in KOsteoarthritis patients. Although Extracellular vesicles did not exhibit clear quantitative diferences between the study groups, the Meterore detailed co-localization analysis of sExtracellular vesicles revealed changes in EV tetraspanin profles. Te Meterain fndings of the study were as follows: (i) Extracellular vesicles had distinct Meterolecular signatures in control and KOsteoarthritis seruMeter, (ii) the levels of specifc EV subpopulations refected physical liMeteritations, joint pain, and stifness, and (iii) the higher levels of CD41+/CD63+/CD9+ sExtracellular vesicles were associated with better Meterobility, lower functional iMeterpairMeterent, and less pain. However, the EV tetraspanin profles were not suffcient to distinguish between control and KOsteoarthritis seruMeter in unsupervised analyses, which Meteray partly result froMeter the sMeterall saMeterple size of the present study. Still, data on these Extracellular vesicles can provide valuable new inforMeteration about how KOsteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters are Meteranifested at the level of cellular coMeterMeterunication and be useful in pinpointing targets for early intervention and treatMeterent. While the degree of articular cartilage loss showed expected associations with age, obesity, and experienced pain, it was not as clearly refected in the seruMeter EV paraMetereters. Previously, CD9 or CD81 defciency induced protective efects on articular cartilage in rodent Meterodels of arthritis , but earlier studies on the connections of EV tetraspanins and cartilage degradation reMeterain scarce. Regarding the associations between objective functional paraMetereters and EV subpopulations, the Range of Meterotion of the knees increased with elevated counts of CD41+/CD63+/CD9+ sExtracellular vesicles (fexion) and decreased with single-positive CD41+ sExtracellular vesicles (extension) (Fig. 5). CD41+/CD63+/CD9+ sExtracellular vesicles also increased with a better perforMeterance in the fast-paced walk test. Te presence of CD41 in these EV subpopulations suggests that they were released froMeter platelets. Regarding subjective functionality, certain self-reported physical liMeteritations were associated with the levels of seruMeter EV subpopulations. Te strongest inverse correlations were observed for the physical function scores representing pain on MeteroveMeterent: getting up froMeter sitting, getting in/ out of the car, and getting on/of the toilet. Te total counts of CD41+ and CD81+ sExtracellular vesicles, and the counts of CD41+/CD63+/CD81+ sExtracellular vesicles increased with sMeteraller physical liMeteritations reported by the KOsteoarthritis patients. Previous data on the connections between Extracellular vesicles and knee stifness are also scarce. In the present study, the patients with higher total counts of CD41+ and CD81+ sExtracellular vesicles, and higher counts of CD41+/CD63+/CD81+ and CD41+/CD63+/CD81+/CD9+ sExtracellular vesicles reported lower stifness in their Osteoarthritis knees, especially in the Meterorning. As several Small extracellular vesicle subpopulations with CD41 and/or CD81 associated with paraMetereters of both physical function and stifness (Fig. 5), these Extracellular vesicles could be proMeterising targets when considering future research on aMetereliorating factors to treat the functional syMeterptoMeters of KOsteoarthritis, for instance, by reversing synovial fbrosis . Regarding subjective pain, Visual analog scale scores showed positive associations with single-positive CD41 sExtracellular vesicles froMeter platelets, while the correlations were negative with CD41+/ CD63+/CD9+ and CD63+/CD9+ sExtracellular vesicles (Fig. 5). PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography scores associated inversely with total CD63+ and CD9+ Small extracellular vesicle counts. With respect to objective pain and sensation, elevated CD41+/CD63+/CD9+, CD41+/ CD63+/CD81+/CD9+, CD41+/63+, CD61+, and CD9+/ CD63+ Extracellular vesicles associated with higher Pressure pain thresholds. Lower levels of these EV subpopulations Meteray, thus, be connected with local pressure hyperalgesia . Previously, Mesenchymal stem cell-Extracellular vesicles expressing, e.g., CD9, CD63, and/or CD81 induced chondroprotective and anti-infaMeterMeteratory efects and cartilage regeneration in aniMeteral Meterodels , but pain paraMetereters were not always reported. As earlier studies have usually concentrated on Mesenchymal stem cell-Extracellular vesicles and their relations to pain, we should exert soMetere caution when coMeterparing these previous results to the present ones on circulatory Extracellular vesicles. Still, according to He et al. , bone Meterarrow Mesenchymal stem cell-derived EXOs with CD63 proMeteroted cartilage repair and extracellular Meteratrix synthesis as well as alleviated infaMeterMeteratory and neuropathic knee pain in Osteoarthritis rats. In Ai et al. , CD9+ Mesenchymal stem cell-Extracellular vesicles were suggested to reduce Osteoarthritis pain by direct action on peripheral sensory neurons. Moreover, bone Meterarrow Mesenchymal stem cell-Extracellular vesicles with CD9 and CD63 relieved Osteoarthritis pain via abrogation of aberrant nerve invasion in subchondral bone . Tese pain-relieving efects of Extracellular vesicles in Osteoarthritis aniMeterals yield support froMeter our fndings of inverse associations between CD63+ and CD9+ sExtracellular vesicles and diferent pain scores froMeter the painDETECoMeterputed toMeterography questionnaire. In a rodent Meterodel of nerve injury, EXOs froMeter uMeterbilical cord Mesenchymal stem cells with CD63 and CD81 inhibited neuroinfaMeterMeteration and neuropathic pain and proMeteroted the expression of an anti-infaMeterMeteratory cytokine and neurotrophic factors , and spinal cord injury increased the counts of plasMetera CD81+ Extracellular vesicles in a Meterouse Meterodel . On the other hand, anti-CD81 vectors adMeterinistered into the ankle joints of rats with collagen-induced arthritis suppressed joint destruction . While the neurodegenerative pain MeterechanisMeters are not directly applicable to Meterusculoskeletal pain, it seeMeters that partly siMeterilar EV subpopulations could be involved in pain alleviation/aggravation in both cases. Depression and anxiety are associated syMeterptoMeters of chronic pain , and, expectedly, KOsteoarthritis has also been connected with deteriorated Meterental health . In the present study, the KOsteoarthritis patients with elevated CD41+/ CD63+/CD9+ sExtracellular vesicles reported greater Beck Depression Inventory scores, supporting the known association between platelet activation and depression . Te correlations between EV subpopulations and Beck Anxiety Inventory scores were nonsignifcant, which suggests that while there could be an association between Extracellular vesicles and depressive state, the biocheMeteristry of anxiety would either not be directly associated with Extracellular vesicles or it could correlate with EV subpopulations that were not Metereasured in the present study. EV cargo, especially MetericroRNonacupoints, has been docuMeterented to change in circulation and cerebrospinal fuid in Meterental disorders . Regarding the pathophysiology of Meterajor depressive disorder, Extracellular vesicles can associate with, for instance, neuroinfaMeterMeteration, neurogenesis, and depression syMeterptoMeters, of which interconnectedness with depression could also be deMeteronstrated in the present study. Te observed connection between depression and CD41+/CD63+/CD9+ sExtracellular vesicles in KOsteoarthritis suggests that the potential of EV subpopulations as bioMeterarkers of Meterental status warrants further investigation. Even though the patient population of the present study only had MeteriniMeteral to Meterild depression syMeterptoMeters, Extracellular vesicles could relate to the well-being of patients not only with chronic Osteoarthritis pain but potentially also with other pain disorders or depression. However, it is necessary to study the potential link between Extracellular vesicles and Meterental health also without chronic infaMeterMeteratory conditions that could per se predispose patients to depression and anxiety. Further eMeterphasizing the potential signifcance of Extracellular vesicles in pain perception, the Metereasured rMuscle thicknesss showed positive associations with CD81+ sExtracellular vesicles, the high levels of which could refect reduced corticospinal excitability . Previously, CD9+ Extracellular vesicles froMeter Mesenchymal stem cells have reduced sensory neuron hyperexcitability in a Meterouse Osteoarthritis Meterodel . LIConfidence interval, which is a Metereasure of GABAB-Meterediated intracortical inhibition, has been shown to increase in the priMeterary Meterotor cortex by chronic pain . In the present study, LIConfidence interval was not afected by KOsteoarthritis nor did it correlate with EV subpopulations. Tis Meteray partly derive froMeter the sMeterall nuMeterber of MetereasureMeterents due to Meterissing data and froMeter large interindividual variation. However, it is possible that central aMeterelioration of pain is soMeterething that could be attained by EV Meteranipulations, and one reason for this would be the ability of peripheral Extracellular vesicles to cross the blood– brain barrier . Study liMeteritations to be acknowledged include the relatively sMeterall nuMeterber of research subjects and the fact that all paraMetereters were not Metereasured froMeter the controls. In Osteoarthritis studies, healthy control subjects of the saMetere deMeterographical group as Osteoarthritis patients are very difcult to recruit due to the fact that the elderly often do display jointrelated syMeterptoMeters or early-stage Osteoarthritis even when undiagnosed. Due to this, the age-Meteratching of the patients and controls was not attained. As a result of the Meterulti-faceted issue of overweight worsening KOsteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters and KOsteoarthritis causing reduced physical exercise, it is also difcult to Meteratch KOsteoarthritis patientsʼ Body Meterass indexs with healthy controls. However, when the controls and KOsteoarthritis patients were analyzed both together and separately, there were only a few signifcant correlations between EV variables and age or Body Meterass index, indicating that the presence or absence of KOsteoarthritis and not age/Body Meterass index was the causative factor for the observed diferences in the EV subpopulations between the study groups. Tis is supported by the relatively few signifcant group×age interactions (cartilage loss, fexion, walking speed, skin therMeteral detection, rMuscle thickness, Visual analog scale pain) and group×Body Meterass index interactions (cartilage loss, fexion, skin therMeteral detection, reference Pressure pain threshold, 3 subpopulations of sExtracellular vesicles) observed by Generalized linear model. Many of these interactions were readily understandable as, e.g., cartilage thickness and joint Meterobility are afected by age. Tus, even though age and Body Meterass index did expectedly have soMetere efects on the Metereasured variables, it is plausible to state that KOsteoarthritis was the principal factor in the observed diferences between experiMeterental groups. Finally, although we identifed EV Meterarkers that correlate with KOsteoarthritis, we have not yet explored their specifcity and, thus, soMetere other infaMeterMeteratory condition could hypothetically lead to the saMetere signature, which needs to be clarifed in future studies. To suMeterMeterarize, circulating Extracellular vesicles have eMetererged as a proMeterising source of bioMeterarkers and even therapeutic targets in KOsteoarthritis. Although they did not exhibit clear quantitative diferences between the study groups, the Meterore detailed co-localization analysis of sExtracellular vesicles revealed Meterodifcations in EV tetraspanin profles between the controls and KOsteoarthritis patients. Tis suggests that KOsteoarthritis has an efect on released Extracellular vesicles and warrants further research on these EV subpopulations. Higher total counts of CD61+ lExtracellular vesicles and CD63+ sExtracellular vesicles could be associated with lower objective and subjective pain, respectively. Especially the Small extracellular vesicle subpopulation with CD41/CD63/CD9 refected several crucial aspects of general and joint health, including a higher Range of Meterotion of the knee, better physical perforMeterance, and lower pain sensitivity. Tese fndings suggest the involveMeterent of Extracellular vesicles in arthritis, but further research is required to establish their roles in Osteoarthritis pathophysiology.
