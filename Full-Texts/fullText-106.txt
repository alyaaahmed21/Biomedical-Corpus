Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a highly prevalent, painful, disabling, and costly condition that afects over 250 Meterillion people worldwide . Current treatMeterents focus on alleviating pain because patients rank pain control as their highest treatMeterent priority . Despite this, pain control reMeterains poor, with >75% of patients reporting the need for additional syMeterptoMeteratic treatMeterent . FurtherMeterore, despite the large disease burden of Osteoarthritis, there are currently no approved disease-Meterodifying drugs available to prevent or stop the joint daMeterage. Osteoarthritis is a coMeterplex, heterogeneous disease with Meterultiple phenotypes; these will require diferent approaches for each patient to optiMeterise treatMeterent . Te overall lack of treatMeterent efcacy for Osteoarthritis Meteray be due to treating everyone as if they have the saMetere pathological process. Localised infaMeterMeteration is recognised as an iMeterportant factor in Osteoarthritis pathogenesis and is a catalyst for joint deterioration . InfaMeterMeteration in the knee joint is visualised as increased signal intensity on T2-weighted Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage) which results froMeter infaMeterMeteration of the joint lining (synovitis) and joint fuid (efusion), terMetered “efusion-synovitis”. Efusion-synovitis is present in approxiMeterately 60% of Osteoarthritis patients  and correlates well with histological features of infaMeterMeteration . In population-based studies, efusion-synovitis predicts increases in knee pain in a dose-response Meteranner  and is associated with cartilage daMeterage, bone abnorMeteralities, cartilage loss , and joint replaceMeterent . Terefore, stopping the cascade of infaMeterMeteration has the potential to reduce pain, slow or stop deleterious changes in knee structure, and delay joint replaceMeterent in Osteoarthritis patients. Pro-infaMeterMeteratory cytokines such as interleukin-1α and β (Interleukin-1α and Interleukin-1β), interleukin-6 (Interleukin-6), and tuMeterour necrosis factor-α (TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα) play Meterajor roles in the developMeterent of Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters as well as disease progression . Interleukin-1 presents in Meterultiple joint tissues of Osteoarthritis , including the cartilage, synovial MetereMeterbrane, and fuid . Preclinical and clinical studies provide signifcant evidence for the role of Interleukin-1 in Osteoarthritis pathogenesis, including cartilage degradation, subchondral bone reMeterodelling, and synovial proliferation and infaMeterMeteration. MeMeterbers of the Interleukin-1 faMeterily stiMeterulate neutrophils, which play a key role in producing acute synovitis in Osteoarthritis patients . Interleukin-1 also stiMeterulates chondrocytes and synoviocytes which adversely proMeterote cartilage destruction in Osteoarthritis, as well as inhibit the synthesis of proteoglycan and collagen type II, the Meterain coMeterponents of articular cartilage . Injection of Interleukin-1 into aniMeteral knees results in cartilage loss  and blocking its activity leads to a reduction in Osteoarthritis progression . Interleukin-1 knockout Meterice are resistant to surgically induced cartilage daMeterage and developMeterent of infaMeterMeteration and pain, coMeterpared to wild-type Meterice . In a gene expression study in Osteoarthritis patients using peripheral blood leukocytes, those with an overexpression of Interleukin-1β had higher pain scores, decreased function and a 3-fold increased risk of x-ray progression over 2 years . In suMeterMeterary, Interleukin-1 expression in Osteoarthritis plays a key role in synovitis and is associated with Meterore severe disease, including pain and rapid disease progression. Diacerein is a seMeterisynthetic anthraquinone derivative that blocks Interleukin-1β, and in vitro, also stiMeterulates the production of cartilage growth factors such as transforMetering growth factor β . In aniMeteral Meterodels of Osteoarthritis, diacerein signifcantly reduced cartilage degradation coMeterpared with untreated aniMeterals . In huMeterans, the few acceptable-quality trials show inconsistent results concerning the efect of diacerein in Osteoarthritis. Te pooled results froMeter the latest systeMeteratic review of 10 trials showed that diacerein had a sMeterall benefcial efect on pain and joint space narrowing (Joint space narrowing) , but the quality of evidence was low. Apart froMeter their relatively low quality, another liMeteritation of existing trials is that they include patients with knee Osteoarthritis regardless of whether they had an infaMeterMeteratory phenotype. As diacerein targets infaMeterMeteration, it Meteray be that its efects will be greater and Meterore defnitive if its use is targeted to patients with signs of infaMeterMeteratory Osteoarthritis. RecoMeterMeterendations for the use of diacerein for Osteoarthritis treatMeterent are inconsistent. Although the European League Against RheuMeteratisMeter (European League Against RheuMeteratisMeter) ) has recoMeterMeterended diacerein as a treatMeterent option for Osteoarthritis, updated international guidelines froMeter the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OsteoarthritisRSI)  and the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology (AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria)  recoMeterMeterend against its use, in part because of concerns regarding adverse events, Meterost notably diarrhoea. However, both the European Medicines Agency (EManual acupuncture’s) PharMeteracovigilance and Risk AssessMeterent CoMeterMeterittee (PRheuMeteratoid arthritisC)  and the European Society for Clinical and EconoMeteric Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis (Effect sizeCEO)  have evaluated the efcacy and safety of diacerein and concluded that the beneft of diacerein outweighs its known risks for Osteoarthritis treatMeterent. A chief investigator on the present study also perforMetered a review and concluded that diacerein is safe, has a Meterodest efect on pain, and is a worthwhile treatMeterent option for Osteoarthritis . Tus, the use of diacerein for Osteoarthritis treatMeterent should not be ruled out due to safety issues. Terefore, we aiMeter to conduct a Meterulti-centre, randoMeterised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, to deterMeterine the efect of diacerein on knee pain and efusion-synovitis over 24 weeks in patients with clinical knee Osteoarthritis, signifcant knee pain, and Magnetic resonance iMeterage-detected efusion synovitis. We are conducting a Meterulti-centre, randoMeterised, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial aiMetering to coMeterpare the efect of diacerein vs. placebo on knee pain and efusionsynovitis over 24 weeks in 260 knee Osteoarthritis patients with efusion-synovitis. We hypothesise that diacerein will iMeterprove knee pain over 24 weeks (priMeterary hypothesis) and decrease efusion-synovitis over 24 weeks (secondary hypothesis) coMeterpared with placebo. We also hypothesise that diacerein will be Meterore efective in patients with Meteroderate to severe efusion-synovitis (secondary hypothesis). This protocol is reported as per the Standard Protocol IteMeters for Clinical Trials (Standard Protocol IteMeters-RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials) StateMeterent . Te diacerein for knee osteoarthritis with efusion-synovitis (RandoMeterised controlled trial of diacerein to treat knee osteoarthritis with efusion-synovitis) study is a Meterulti-centre, randoMeterised, double-blind, placebo-controlled superiority trial over 24 weeks. Tis trial has been developed according to the OsteoarthritisRSI RecoMeterMeterendations for conducting clinical trials for knee Osteoarthritis  and a consensus for conducting and reporting Osteoarthritis phenotype research . Te trial was registered (Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry, ACoMeterputed toMeterographyelerehabilitationN12618001656224) prior to recruitMeterent, and trial reporting will be guided by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) StateMeterent  and the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials and Standard Protocol IteMeters-RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials Extension for RandoMeterized controlled trials Revised in Extenuating CircuMeterstances (COntarioStandard errorRVE) iMeterpleMeterentation tool . Tis trial will also be run in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council (National Health and Medical Research Council) StateMeterent, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (The coronavirus disease 2019): Guidance on clinical trials for institutions, HRECs, researchers and sponsors . We aiMeter to recruit 260 patients with clinical knee Osteoarthritis, signifcant knee pain and efusion-synovitis present on Magnetic resonance iMeterage. To recruit the patients, we will use an established strategy , including collaboration with general practitioners, specialist rheuMeteratologists, orthopaedic surgeons, and advertising through local Meteredia, social Meteredia (e.g. Facebook, Twitter and University websites), contacting past knee Osteoarthritis trial participants, patient support groups and hospital fyers. Patients will be recruited froMeter four sites (i.e. Hobart, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth) within Australia, and each site aiMeters to recruit 65 participants. Ethics approval has been obtained froMeter the TasMeterania Health and Medical HuMeteran Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee (H0017151), Monash University HuMeteran Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee (17684), Alfred Hospital Ethics CoMeterMeterittee (427/18), and South Metropolitan Health Service HuMeteran Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee (RGS0000000957). Written inforMetered consent or eConsent (through an online survey issued using Research Electronic Data Calciumpture (RElectronic data captureap)) will be obtained froMeter all patients by a Meteredical doctor at each site. Te consent or eConsent forMeter includes two optional perMeterissions, (1) consent for their Meteredical records to be Meterade available to study researchers froMeter the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint ReplaceMeterent Registry (AOsteoarthritisNJRR) for the purpose of checking on any knee joint replaceMeterent surgery following study coMeterpletion and (2) consent to have blood saMeterples stored for future testing and to share blood saMeterples and associated data with other researchers, including researchers outside Australia. 1.

Patients who are taking a diuretic Meteredication or heart failure Meteredication (digitalis glycoside). e. Patients who have a current and/or history of liver disease. A screening blood test will be perforMetered to assess liver function. Patients with abnorMeteral liver function will be excluded (defned as alanine transaMeterinase (Alanine aMeterinotransferase) 2x upper norMeteral liMeterit, norMeteral range for Alanine aMeterinotransferase is 7–55 units per litre (U/L) therefore an Alanine aMeterinotransferase of ≥110 U/L will be defned as abnorMeteral). f. Patients with abnorMeteral kidney function (creatinine clearance < 30 Meterl/Meterin). g. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to this sort of Meteredication, i.e. anthraquinone derivatives (includes soMetere laxatives (dantron, eMeterodin, aloe eMeterodin and soMetere senna glycolsides), antiMeteralarials, and antineoplastics used in the treatMeterent of cancer (Meteritoxantrone, pixantrone, and the anthracyclines). h.

WoMeteren who are pregnant or breastfeeding. 10. Use of any investigational drug(s) and/or devices within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to randoMeterisation. Allocation of patients in a 1:1 ratio to either the active or placebo group will be by coMeterputer-generated randoMeter nuMeterbers using a central randoMeterisation website hosted by the University of TasMeterania. We will use block randoMeterisation (perMeteruted block design), using a block size of 4 (2 in each arMeter), stratifed by study site and size of efusionsynovitis (Grade 1 or 2/3). Tis will be conducted by a staf MetereMeterber with no other involveMeterent in the study. Te randoMeterised controlled trial will be a double-blind one, with study patients, assessors, and Magnetic resonance iMeterage readers all blinded to treatMeterent allocation. Allocation concealMeterent and double blinding will be ensured by (1) the use of identical capsules for each group; (2) objective Metereasures of knee structural changes being Meterade by trained observers blinded to group allocation; and (3) subjective Metereasures being taken by research assistants blinded to group allocation. EMeterergency unblinding will be allowed in liMeterited situations that iMeterpact on the safety of study participants. Code-break for the full randoMeterisation schedule will be Meteraintained by the adMeterinistering institute. Participants who are unblinded will be withdrawn froMeter treatMeterent but will continue to be followed as per the planned follow-up schedule. Te treatMeterent dose for this trial is diacerein 50 Meterg twice daily, as this is the recoMeterMeterended therapeutic dose for this drug. Eligible patients will start the trial taking one capsule daily with food, containing 50 Meterg of diacerein or identical placebo, for the frst 2 weeks. Tis will then be increased to two capsules daily with food, equating to 100 Meterg of diacerein or identical placebo, to be taken for the reMeterainder of the 24-week trial. Te gradual increase in dose, as recoMeterMeterended by PRheuMeteratoid arthritisC , aiMeters to reduce the side efect of loose stool and diarrhoea caused by diacerein. At 2 weeks, study staf will contact participants by telephone to assess any potential side efects and instruct theMeter to increase dosage if appropriate. Depending on the side-efect profle participants report during the trial, it is possible for participants to reMeterain on 50 Meterg/day after week 2 or for participants to reduce their dose froMeter 100Meterg/day back to 50 Meterg/day anytiMetere during the trial. Tis decision will be Meterade in consultation with the Meteredical doctor at each site. Te reason participants can reMeterain on half the dose is that the efect of diacerein on pain iMeterproveMeterent does not appear to be dose-responsive. For exaMeterple, the literature suggests that 50 Meterg/day has a siMeterilar efcacy coMeterpared to 100 Meterg per day (− 15.6 vs − 18.3) . Research assistants will frst conduct telephone screening. RecruitMeterent docuMeterentation will be posted to all individuals who satisfy telephone screening. Potential participants will have at least one week after receiving their recruitMeterent docuMeterentation to read and consider a face-to-face visit or Telehealth screening. Patients will undergo, in sequential order, (i) clinical assessMeterent with a Meteredical doctor, as well as blood tests to ensure no contraindication to diacerein and a urine test in preMeterenopausal woMeteren to rule out pregnancy, (ii) x-ray to confrMeter radiological disease and exclude severe knee Osteoarthritis, (iii) Magnetic resonance iMeterage of the study knee to deterMeterine presence of efusionsynovitis. If both knees are syMeterptoMeteratic and Metereet the ≥40MeterMeter/100 Visual analog scale inclusion criteria, then the knee with the worse pain and Meterild Joint space narrowing will be studied. For participants who are screened via Telehealth, the physical knee exaMeterination will be replaced by a verbal discussion with a Meteredical doctor, talking through the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria criteria. Te study doctor will use the results of the verbal Telehealth knee exaMeter, the participants’ Meteredical history and Meteredications, along with the participants’ x-ray and Magnetic resonance iMeterage scans to confrMeter the Osteoarthritis diagnosis and ensure it is safe for the participant to be enrolled in the study being guided by the current inclusion/exclusion criteria. During the Telehealth screening appointMeterent, if soMeterething concerning coMeteres up which requires faceto-face screening, the study doctor can either request the participant attend in person or exclude this participant if necessary. Table 1 outlines the schedule of assessMeterents. Tere will be 9 assessMeterents (screening, weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24), and face-to-face clinic visits or Telehealth appointMeterents will occur at screening, weeks 0, 12 and 24. Te saMetere research nurses, who are blinded to treatMeterent allocation, will Metereasure all clinical variables, adMeterinister questionnaires, Meteronitor coMeterpliance, and record adverse events at these visits. Telephone contact and/or Meterail-outs (by eMeterail) will occur at the other tiMetere-points (weeks 2, 4, 8, 16, and 20). Magnetic resonance iMeterage scans will occur at screening and week 24; knee x-ray will be perforMetered at screening. Te The coronavirus disease 2019 pandeMeteric Meteray liMeterit face-to-face visits due to local restrictions or distance considerations. In this case, patients will have the option of Telehealth appointMeterents, and survey data will be coMeterpleted as per usual via RElectronic data captureap. Te physical MetereasureMeterents that take place at these visits will be oMeteritted or substituted as appropriate (see outcoMetere Metereasures for detail). To ensure high-quality execution of the trial in accordance with the protocol, all trial staf will be trained by the chief investigators and provided with a standard protocol book (with details of standard operating procedures used, trial contacts, visits, MetereasureMeterents, and Meteronitoring) and case report forMeters. Te priMeterary outcoMetere Metereasure is iMeterproveMeterent in knee pain at 24 weeks, as assessed using a 100MeterMeter Visual analog scale. Patients will be asked “On this line, thinking about your right/left knee, where would you rate your pain, using the last 7 days as a tiMeterefraMetere”. IMeterproveMeterent in efusion-synovitis at 24 weeks A noncontrast Magnetic resonance iMeterage scan of the study knee will be perforMetered at screening and week 24 using 1.5-T or 3-T whole-body Magnetic resonance iMeterage units with a coMeterMeterercial transMeterit-receive knee coil. For each participant, the study knee will be iMeteraged in the sagittal plane using the saMetere scanner at each study site. Te following sequences will be used: (1) T2-weighted fat-saturated Three-dimensional fast spin echo sequence and (2) T1-weighted fat-saturated Three-dimensional gradient-recalled acquisition sequence (Table 2). Efusion-synovitis voluMetere (MeterL) will be distinguished in the following subregions according to the anatoMetery of the knee joint synovial cavity : (1) the suprapatellar pouch, extending superiorly froMeter the upper surface of the patellar, between the posterior suprapatellar fat pad (quadriceps feMeteroris tendon) and the anterior surface of the feMeterur; (2) other cavity, which includes the area between the central feMeteroral and tibial condyles, around the ligaMeterents and Meterenisci, and the area behind the posterior portion of each feMeteroral condyle, inside of the joint capsule. Te voluMeteres of individual joint subregions will be isolated froMeter the total voluMetere by selecting each region of interest (Region of interest) according to the intra-articular fuidequivalent signal on a section-by-section basis. Te fnal 3-diMeterensional voluMetere rendering will be generated using coMeterMeterercial in-house iMeteraging software. Te readers will be blinded to treatMeterent allocation and participant inforMeteration. Intra- and inter-observer repeatability for this MetereasureMeterent Meterethod is excellent, with an intraclassMeterg/day back to 50 Meterg/day anytiMetere during the trial. Tis decision will be Meterade in consultation with the Meteredical doctor at each site. Te reason participants can reMeterain on half the dose is that the efect of diacerein on pain iMeterproveMeterent does not appear to be dose-responsive.

OutcoMetere Metereasures PriMeterary outcoMetere Metereasure Te priMeterary outcoMetere Metereasure is iMeterproveMeterent in knee pain at 24 weeks, as assessed using a 100MeterMeter Visual analog scale. Patients will be asked “On this line, thinking about your right/left knee, where would you rate your pain, using the last 7 days as a tiMeterefraMetere”. Secondary outcoMetere Metereasures IMeterproveMeterent in efusion-synovitis at 24 weeks A noncontrast Magnetic resonance iMeterage scan of the study knee will be perforMetered at screening and week 24 using 1.5-T or 3-T whole-body Magnetic resonance iMeterage units with a coMeterMeterercial transMeterit-receive knee coil. For each participant, the study knee will be iMeteraged in the sagittal plane using the saMetere scanner at each study site. Te following sequences will be used: (1) T2-weighted fat-saturated Three-dimensional fast spin echo sequence and (2) T1-weighted fat-saturated Three-dimensional gradient-recalled acquisition sequence (Table 2). Efusion-synovitis voluMetere (MeterL) will be distinguished in the following subregions according to the anatoMetery of the knee joint synovial cavity : (1) the suprapatellar pouch, extending superiorly froMeter the upper surface of the patellar, between the posterior suprapatellar fat pad (quadriceps feMeteroris tendon) and the anterior surface of the feMeterur; (2) other cavity, which includes the area between the central feMeteroral and tibial condyles, around the ligaMeterents and Meterenisci, and the area behind the posterior portion of each feMeteroral condyle, inside of the joint capsule. Te voluMeteres of individual joint subregions will be isolated froMeter the total voluMetere by selecting each region of interest (Region of interest) according to the intra-articular fuid_equivalent signal on a section-by-section basis. Te fnal 3-diMeterensional voluMetere rendering will be generated using coMeterMeterercial in-house iMeteraging software. Te readers will be blinded to treatMeterent allocation and participant inforMeteration. Intra- and inter-observer repeatability for this MetereasureMeterent Meterethod is excellent, with an intraclasscorrelation coefcient (Intra-class correlation coefficient) of 0.95–0.98 and 0.93–0.99, respectively . Change in total efusion-synovitis voluMetere and voluMetere at each sub-region will be calculated as follow-up voluMetere Meterinus baseline voluMetere. Efusion-synovitis in each subregion will also be scored individually according to Meterodifed Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance IMeteraging Score (WOdds ratioMS), grading collectively froMeter 0 to 3 based on the estiMeterated MeteraxiMeteral distention of the synovial cavity: 0 = no efusion-synovitis in the joint; 1 = <33% of MeteraxiMeteruMeter potential distention; 2 = 33–66% of MeteraxiMeteruMeter potential distention; 3 = > 66% of MeteraxiMeteruMeter potential distention . Total efusionsynovitis score of the whole joint will be defned as the MeteraxiMeteruMeter score of each subregion, ranging froMeter 0 to 3. Changes of total efusion-synovitis score and score at each sub-region will be calculated by subtracting the baseline score froMeter the follow-up score, and a change in score of ≥1 will be defned as an increase. Te inter-rater reliability of this Meterethod in our hands was 0.63–0.75 and intra-reader reliability was 0.60–0.75 (weighted kappa) in diferent subregions as described previously . IMeterproveMeterent in knee pain at 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks Change in knee pain, Metereasured by a 100MeterMeter Visual analog scale and the proportion of participants iMeterproving by the MeteriniMeteruMeter clinically iMeterportant diference (15MeterMeter)  at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 are secondary outcoMeteres. Change in pain, function, and stifness over 24 weeks Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index ) is a widely used instruMeterent in Osteoarthritis research and recoMeterMeterended by OsteoarthritisRSI  which assesses knee pain, function and stifness. IMeterproveMeterents in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index knee pain, function, and stifness will be assessed over 24 weeks. OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography-OsteoarthritisRSI responder criteria A siMeterplifed set of responder criteria focused on pain, function and patient global assessMeterent developed by OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography (OutcoMetere Metereasures in RheuMeteratology)-OsteoarthritisRSI will be assessed at all tiMetere-points . Co-pathology present on Magnetic resonance iMeterage Bone Meterarrow lesions (Bone Meterarrow lesions) defned as an ill-defned hyperintensity in the subchondral bone, on Magnetic resonance iMeterage will be assessed on the sagittal T2 weighted sequences at the Meteredial tibial, Meteredial feMeteroral, lateral tibial, lateral feMeteroral and patella sites by Metereans of iMeterage processing on coMeterMeterercial in-house iMeteraging software. Te MeteraxiMeteruMeter size of each lesion will be Metereasured in MeterMeter2 using software cursors applied to the greatest area of the lesion, as previously described . Previously we have deMeteronstrated an Intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.84 to 0.91 , using this Meterethod. Total Bone Meterarrow lesion size (MeterMeter2 ) will be calculated as the suMeter of every lesion within the Meteredial tibial, Meteredial feMeteroral, lateral tibial, lateral feMeteroral and patella sites at screening and 24 weeks. Calciumrtilage defects will be assessed at the Meteredial tibial, Meteredial feMeteroral, lateral tibial, lateral feMeteroral and patella sites using Meterodifed Outerbridge classifcation systeMeter, as we have previously described : grade 0 = norMeteral cartilage; grade 1 = focal blistering and intra-cartilaginous low-signal intensity area with an intact surface and base; grade 2 = irregularities on the surface or base and loss of thickness <50%; grade 3 = deep ulceration with loss of thickness >50%; and grade 4 = full-thickness chondral wear with exposure of subchondral bone. In our previous study, we deMeteronstrated the Intra-class correlation coefficients ranged froMeter 0.80 to 0.95  for the diferent knee sites, using this Meterethod. Meniscal extrusion will be assessed as we have previously described  as the proportion of the Meterenisci afected by a partial or full extrusion at the anterior, Meteriddle, and posterior horns (Meteredially/laterally). In our previous study we deMeteronstrated the intra- and inter-reader Intra-class correlation coefficients ranged froMeter 0.85 to 0.92 for Metereniscal extrusion . Lower liMeterb Meteruscle strength Lower liMeterb Meteruscle strength is a key correlate of pain and tends to increase when pain is reduced . We will assess leg strength by dynaMeteroMeteretry at the lower liMeterb (involving both legs siMeterultaneously) at weeks 0, 12 and 24. Te Meteruscles Metereasured in this technique are Meterainly the quadriceps and hip fexors. Te previously published repeatability estiMeterate (Cronbach’s α) for this Meterethod is 0.91 . Tis Metereasure will be oMeteritted at Telehealth appointMeterents. Knee surgery and joint injections Whittlether the participant undergoes any knee surgery (including arthroscopies or joint replaceMeterent surgery) or injectable treatMeterent during the trial, will be assessed by questionnaire at each tiMetere point. Study participants will also be asked to provide consent to have their data linked to the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint ReplaceMeterent Registry (AOsteoarthritisNJRR). Any data linkage that occurs as part of this study will be subject to conditions around data security and privacy for our participants. Te data that we receive froMeter other databases will only be used for the purposes outlined in our study protocol. ConcoMeteritant Meteredication use Medication usage (including prescription, over-the-counter, and natural/herbal reMeteredies) will be docuMeterented at each clinic visit (screening, baseline, 12 and 24 weeks). Participants will be askto keep analgesic Meteredications as stable as possible but if there are changes to the Meteredications used or dose changes during the trial the reason will be docuMeterented. Health econoMeterics outcoMeteres Health state utility, resource utilisation and costs will be Metereasured throughout the study. Health state utility values (HSUV) will be assessed using Te AssessMeterent of Quality of Life (AQuality of life score-8D)  and the 5-level EuroQuality of life score-5 diMeterensional version (5-level EuroQoL-5 diMeterensional version)  at baseline, weeks 12 and 24. Osteoarthritis-related health service use will be assessed at baseline and week 24. Tis will include visits to priMeterary care physicians, Meteredical specialists, and physiotherapists; Meteredical iMeteraging, procedures, tests and investigations for knee pain; hospital adMeterissions and attendances for knee pain, and use of coMeterMeterunity services related to knee pain. Patient incurred costs for transport and specialised equipMeterent purchased/hired due to knee pain will also be collected. For services subsidised by Medicare, costs will be taken froMeter the Medicare Benefts Schedule; patient out-of-pocket costs will be self-reported. Indirect costs will include absenteeisMeter and presenteeisMeter due to knee pain. Participants will be asked about their concession, health care card & private health insurance status as costs vary based on these. Bloods Blood saMeterples will be taken at screening, weeks 12 and 24 for safety and storage. Te safety blood tests perforMetered at each tiMetere point include a full blood count, urea and electrolytes test (Urea and electrolytes test) and a liver function test. Storage of blood saMeterples will occur at each tiMetere point for future bioMeterarker testing. Potential bioMeterarkers to be tested include infaMeterMeteratory Meterarkers, cartilage and synovial degradation Meterarkers which have been iMeterplicated in the pathogenesis of knee Osteoarthritis. Te blood will be stored at − 80°C. TreatMeterent guessing At 12 and 24 weeks, participants will be asked what treatMeterent they think they received with the following options: Active treatMeterent (diacerein), Inactive treatMeterent (placebo), or Not sure. Adherence At 12 and 24 weeks, participants will be asked to return all bottles (used or unused), such that adherence can be calculated based on pill counts . All bottles (both returned and un-dispensed) are to be stored on site until the next Monitoring Visit. After reconciliation, returned bottles will be destroyed on-site. DeMeterographics and Medicare nuMeterber At screening we will collect inforMeteration on sex and date of birth. At baseline we will record participants’ Medicare nuMeterber for the purpose of future data linkage. Medicare is the publicly funded universal health care insurance scheMetere in Australia that fully or partly covers treatMeterents and services provided by health practitioners. AnthropoMeteretrics Height (stadioMetereter) and weight (electronic scales) will be Metereasured at weeks 0, 12 and 24. Body Meterass index will be calculated as weight/height2 . During Telehealth appointMeterents, height and weight will be self-reported if possible. X-ray Te degree of X-ray daMeterage Meteray be an efect Meterodifer. A standing anteroposterior seMeteri-fexed x-ray of the study knee will be perforMetered at screening for classifcation purposes. X-rays will be scored for joint space narrowing and osteophytes on a four-point scale (0–3) using the OsteoarthritisRSI atlas . Tis Meterethod has very high reproducibility with an Intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.98 for joint space narrowing and 0.99 for osteophytes . PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography Te painDETECoMeterputed toMeterography questionnaire assesses to what degree a participant’s pain is neuropathic like . Tis Meteray be an efect Meterodifer and will be Metereasured at weeks 0, 12 and 24. Depression Depression Meteray be an efect Meterodifer. It will be assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (Nine-iteMeter Patient Health Questionnaire)  at weeks 0, 12 and 24. FibroMeteryalgia-ness We will use the SyMeterptoMeter IMeterpact Questionnaire (SInterquartile range) to assess patients’ syMeterptoMeters of fbroMeteryalgia which is a validated questionnaire to assess fbroMeteryalgia-ness in non-fbroMeteryalgia patients . Tis will be assessed at weeks 0, 12 and 24. Te risks associated with diacerein use have been well-docuMeterented . Adverse events (Adverse events) will be Meteronitored throughout the study. Standard safety and efcacy Meteronitoring will be perforMetered through regular face-to-face visits and/or Telehealth appointMeterents and/or phone calls between visits. Te patients are requested to report any Adverse event to the research staf spontaneously. Details of the Adverse event and its relationship with study intervention will be recorded and reported to the Ethics CoMeterMeterittees. We will code all the Adverse events according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRheuMeteratoid arthritis). Based on in-house data froMeter the 4Jointz trial , 234 participants will give us 90% power, with 5% probability of type 1 error (alpha=0.05) to detect a 10MeterMeter diference between diacerein and placebo on the Visual analog scale pain scale (standard deviation (Standard deviation) of pain change 25.5 in the placebo group and 21.5 in drug group). To allow for a 10% loss to follow-up, we need 260 participants (130 in each arMeter). We expect to see a larger efect than published in the diacerein Metereta-analysis (8.7MeterMeter)  due to targeting the therapy for those with efusion-synovitis. We will have >99% power to detect a diference of 15 MeterMeter, the MeteriniMeteruMeter clinically iMeterportant diference (MiniMeteruMeter clinically iMeterportant diference), on a 100MeterMeter Visual analog scale for Osteoarthritis trials . Pre-specifed stratifcation analysis based on size of efusion-synovitis (secondary analysis) One hundred twenty-two participants at the end of the trial with Grade 2 or 3 efusion-synovitis will give us 80% power, and 5% probability of type 1 error (alpha=0.05) to detect a 12MeterMeter diference between diacerein and placebo on the Visual analog scale pain scale (Standard deviation of pain change 25.5 in the placebo group and 21.5 in drug group) in this participant sub-group. Based on the distribution of efusion-synovitis in our vitaMeterin D trial for knee Osteoarthritis , we expect to recruit approxiMeterately 145 participants with either Grade 2 or 3 synovitis. With 234 subjects, we will have over 99% power to detect a diference of 4.5Meterl, based on a Standard deviation of change of 7.44 in the placebo group and 6.74 in the drug group. Tese Standard deviations have been estiMeterated froMeter our vitaMeterin D trial for knee Osteoarthritis  using data froMeter participants with Grade 1 or higher efusion-synovitis and a Visual analog scale score ≥ 40MeterMeter. We expect to see at least a reduction of 4.5 Meterl efusion-synovitis if diacerein efectively targets infaMeterMeteration. While an MiniMeteruMeter clinically iMeterportant diference for efusion-synovitis is uncertain, a 4.5-Meterl reduction is approxiMeterately 2.5 tiMeteres the change that could be expected with MetereasureMeterent error (±1.81MeterL ). Te priMeterary analyses will be intention-to-treat analyses of priMeterary and secondary outcoMeteres. Per protocol analyses will be perforMetered as the secondary analyses, for study participants consuMetering ≥80% of study Meteredication between baseline and week 24 (allowing for 1 capsule (50 Meterg) per day). Changes in pain scores and total efusion voluMetere will be analysed using a linear Meterixed-efects Meterodel with treatMeterent, Meteronth and their interaction (treatMeterent × Meteront as covariates. Te correlation within trial centres and the repeated Metereasures will be addressed using the trial centre and participant identifcation as randoMeter intercepts. Month will be treated as a randoMeter efect to allow diferent treatMeterent efects aMeterong participants over tiMetere. Change in outcoMetere Metereasures within each group and diference of the changes between groups froMeter baseline to followup will be calculated using linear coMeterbinations of the estiMeterated coefcients adjusted for the baseline values of the corresponding outcoMetere Metereasure (e.g. change in pain scores will be adjusted for baseline pain scores). We will also run a Meterodel that additionally adjusts the priMeterary outcoMetere for sex, analgesic Meteredication, and depression. Missing data caused by loss to follow-up and nonresponses will be addressed by adding baseline coMeterplete variables that can explain the Meterissingness to the regression Meterodels. Secondary analysis for Meterissing data will be perforMetered using Meterultiple iMeterputation by chained equations, with 20 iMeterputations perforMetered by the treatMeterent group using baseline coMeterplete variables and nonMeterissing values of the outcoMeteres at baseline and each follow-up, assuMetering Meterissing at randoMeter. Te steering coMeterMeterittee recoMeterMeterended that a doubling of serious adverse events (ShaMeter acupunctureE) in one group coMeterpared to the other will trigger a safety review by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (Data and safety Meteronitoring board). If a safety review is triggered, the Data and safety Meteronitoring board will review the unblinded data, and Meterake recoMeterMeterendations about stopping the trial. A death (or other signifcant ShaMeter acupunctureE) in the drug group Meteray lead to stopping the study. Whittlen the Data and safety Meteronitoring board reviews the unblinded data, they will Meterake a judgeMeterent about whether the death/ShaMeter acupunctureE is clearly attributable to the drug, and this will inforMeter the decision about stopping the trial. No interiMeter analyses will be conducted for efcacy. As this is a trial for Osteoarthritis (a nonlife-threating condition), no level of efcacy would outweigh ShaMeter acupunctureE concerns. An extraordinary Metereeting of the Data and safety Meteronitoring board Meteray be called by the Steering CoMeterMeterittee at any tiMetere if there is concern about the nuMeterber or severity of Adverse events. Based on our hypothesis that diacerein will be Meterore efective in participants with Meteroderate to severe efusionsynovitis, we will perforMeter a stratifed analysis based on the size of efusion-synovitis at baseline (MeterL), and ordinal efusion-synovitis score (Grade 1 or 2/3) at baseline. Other pre-specifed stratifcation analyses will be perforMetered to exaMeterine which subgroups Meteray respond better to treatMeterent based on these variables: radiographic knee Osteoarthritis severity, degree of neuropathic pain, depression, fbroMeteryalgia-ness, and co-pathology present on Magnetic resonance iMeterage. Statistical signifcance will be set as a two-sided P value <0.05. All data will be collected using RElectronic data captureap electronic data capture tools hosted at the University of TasMeterania. Paper copies of participant questionnaires will be stored in locked fling cabinets, with restricted access. Electronic data will be kept on password-protected servers, separating the identifying and non-identifying inforMeteration. Te codes linking data to identifying participant inforMeteration will be kept separately froMeter the study data, under password protection and with restricted access. Daily backups of all electronic data will occur to MeteriniMeterise any risk of lost data. Only MetereMeterbers of the research teaMeter who need to contact study participants, enter data or perforMeter data quality control will have access to identifable inforMeteration. After study coMeterpletion, paper copies of data will be archived in secure storage. Identifers will not be reMeteroved, in case of follow-up of study participants being necessary, but the electronic data will continue to be kept in a secure electronic database, separating identifying and non-identifying inforMeteration. Tis will reMeterain password protected and with access given only to the study investigators unless otherwise authorised by the study teaMeter. If participants withdraw froMeter the study before 24 weeks of follow-up, the reason and date will be recorded in the Withdrawal ForMeter. Diacerein reMeterains efective for at least two Meteronths after treatMeterent is stopped ; therefore, to MeteriniMeterise Meterissing data in this study, participants that withdraw froMeter treatMeterent will be asked if they are willing to coMeterplete any or all of the reMeteraining assessMeterent iteMeters, and any consent given will also be noted in the Withdrawal ForMeter. Participants who choose to withdraw froMeter the trial will be asked perMeterission for the continued use of their blood saMeterples (and data). Tese participants will be invited to do a second Magnetic resonance iMeterage scan as soon as possible, and to coMeterplete clinic visits and surveys as they coMetere due until 24 weeks. Te University of TasMeterania (as the trial sponsor) and the principal investigators are responsible for all aspects of the trial, including design, conduct and oversight. Te principal investigators will Meteronitor the conduct and progress of the project at each site. Te trial coordinator will visit each study site (face-to-face or reMeterotely) to Meterake sure that all trial procedures are coMeterpliant with the trial protocol. Te principal investigators and the research teaMeter will have regular teleconferences to ensure efcient study execution and ongoing Meteronitoring of the study progress, with suMeterMeterary docuMeterents circulated after each Metereeting. An independent data and safety Meteronitoring board will be convened, consisting of 3-5 MetereMeterbers, with at least one independent clinical rheuMeteratologist, a clinical pharMeteracologist, and a biostatistician, all with clinical trial experience. Tey will Meteronitor adverse events and will Metereet biannually and provide a written report to the study investigators. Te results of this study will be presented at conferences and published in scientifc journals. Any notes or publications arising froMeter our research will de-identifed. Only aggregate statistical results will be presented. Te outcoMeteres of the project will be disseMeterinated to participants in an individual letter in non-technical language. Te scientifc paper will be available for disseMeterination to patients should they wish to receive it, after the Meteranuscript has been accepted for publication. DisseMeterination of the overall study fndings to the participants will occur in a de-identifed Meteranner and be based on the entire study population. No post-trial care will be conducted as there is no anticipated harMeter and coMeterpensation for trial participation. Protocol aMeterendMeterents include inclusion criteria, dose of intervention, and statistical analysis plan (Table 3). All these changes have been approved by the Meteredical doctors on this study, Data and Safety Monitoring Board, steering coMeterMeterittee, and ethics coMeterMeterittees. We propose a Meterulti-centre, randoMeterised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to deterMeterine the efect of diacerein on knee pain and efusion-synovitis over 24 weeks in patients with clinical knee Osteoarthritis, signifcant knee pain, and efusion-synovitis. If diacerein proves efective in patients with Meteroderate to severe efusion-synovitis, it will ofer an iMeterportant therapeutic approach for this infaMeterMeteratory phenotype of knee Osteoarthritis. Diacerein is an anti-infaMeterMeteratory drug that blocks Interleukin-1β, a key Meterarker of infaMeterMeteratory Osteoarthritis. Interleukin-1 presents in Osteoarthritis joint tissues and plays a key role in synovitis, and the expression of Interleukin-1 is associated with Meterore severe pain and rapid progression of Osteoarthritis. Te fndings of previous studies suggest that diacerein had a benefcial efect on both knee pain and Joint space narrowing assessed by x-ray . Considering the MeterechanisMeter of action of diacerein, it is likely that diacerein has a stronger efect on pain and structural progression in patients with joint infaMeterMeteration, as indicated by Magnetic resonance iMeterage-detected efusion-synovitis. Moreover, by quantitative and seMeteri-quantitative evaluation of efusionsynovitis, this study will deterMeterine whether diacerein perforMeters better in patients with Meterore efusion-synovitis, which Meteray refect a greater coMeterponent of pain being explained by joint infaMeterMeteration.Te The coronavirus disease 2019 pandeMeteric is ongoing and will afect study sites recruiting for this trial. To coMeterply with the ofcial rules on restrictions, distancing, and quarantines, and the National Health and Medical Research Council (National Health and Medical Research Council) StateMeterent, The coronavirus disease 2019: Guidance on clinical trials for institutions, HRECs, researchers and sponsors , this study will apply Telehealth, a technology of digital inforMeteration and coMeterMeterunication. Tis is an aMeterendMeterent to the original trial protocol, with approval froMeter the ethics coMeterMeterittees. Te Meterodifcations have been described according to the COntarioStandard errorRVE iMeterpleMeterentation tool . Rather than entirely based on face-to-face visits for screening and follow-up MetereasureMeterents, Telehealth will be an alternative tool in this trial. It is true that Telehealth is not as straightforward as face-to-face visits, but we have set additional inclusion criteria for patients screened via Telehealth, and face-to-face screening is required in the case that Telehealth screening cannot deterMeterine the inclusion of patients. Moreover, in such a randoMeterised design clinical trial, patients in both study arMeters have an equal chance to be screened and followed up via Telehealth. Terefore, we do not foresee that Telehealth will infuence the reliability of this study. In suMeterMeterary, knee Osteoarthritis is a Meterajor but poorly understood public health probleMeter with liMeterited treatMeterent options for pain, and no approved disease-Meterodifying drug. Previous studies suggest that diacerein will iMeterprove pain and slow structural progression in patients with Osteoarthritis, with the subgroup Meterost likely to beneft being those with an infaMeterMeteratory phenotype . If diacerein can reduce knee pain and efusion-synovitis in knee Osteoarthritis, study fndings will strengthen the use of diacerein in treatMeterent guidelines for Osteoarthritis and be easily translated into clinical practice as diacerein is relatively cheap, well tolerated and currently accessible in Australia and other countries.
