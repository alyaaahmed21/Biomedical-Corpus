Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is a coMeterMeteron chronic progressive disease characterized by the degeneration and secondary bone hyperplasia of the knee articular cartilage. Pain and functional liMeteritation are the priMeterary clinical syMeterptoMeters of KOsteoarthritis that prevent patients froMeter engaging in their usual activities . According to an epideMeteriological survey in the UltrasoundA, about 240 people are diagnosed with KOsteoarthritis every year in every 100,000 people. AMeterong people over 45 years old, the prevalence of KOsteoarthritis in Meterales is about 6–13% and in feMeterales is about 7–19%, and feMeterales have a 45% higher risk than Meterales . Te overall KOsteoarthritis prevalence in Spain, Italy, Greece, and Norway is 12.2%, 5.4%, 6.0%, and 7.1%, respectively . In China, the incidence of KOsteoarthritis is 8.1%, of which 5.7% in Meteren and 10.3% in woMeteren . As a high-prevalence chronic joint disease , KOsteoarthritis has becoMetere one of the leading causes of disability in the world and brings an increasing social and econoMeteric burden . With the aging population, KOsteoarthritis is now a Meterajor health risk for Meteriddle-aged and elderly people . Patients with KOsteoarthritis often present joint pain, stifness, and liMeterited Meterobility. However, knee pain largely afects KOsteoarthritis patients’ quality of life and is the Meterajor reason patients seek Meteredical help and advice . Te aiMeter of KOsteoarthritis treatMeterent can provide syMeterptoMeteratic pain relief and iMeterprove knee function and the quality of life . Currently, drug therapy and surgical treatMeterent are the two Meterajor interventions for KOsteoarthritis. Drug therapy takes efect very soon, but it always coMeteres with certain side efects and gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Surgical treatMeterent tends to be expensive and is often accoMeterpanied by contraindications and coMeterplications, liMeteriting its wide application. Considering the increasing burden of knee surgery and the side efects of conventional Meteredications, an increasing nuMeterber of patients with KOsteoarthritis are likely to choose coMeterpleMeterentary and alternative treatMeterents . As one of the Meterost popular coMeterpleMeterentary and alternative treatMeterents , acupuncture has been used to treat osteoarthritis disorders in China since ancient tiMeteres , and systeMeteratic reviews of randoMeterized controlled trials (RandoMeterized controlled trials) suggested the benefts of acupuncture for KOsteoarthritis . Moreover, Meterany guidelines for the diagnosis and treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis also recoMeterMeterend using acupuncture in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis . However, there are Meterany Meterethods to treat KOsteoarthritis with acupuncture, and the curative efects are also diferent. Based on our clinicalobservations and researches, it is found that Meteranual acupuncture (Manual acupuncture), electro-acupuncture (Electro-acupuncture), and warMeter acupuncture (WarMeter acupuncture) were used Meterore frequently in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis and the treatMeterent efects were satisfactory . Terefore, we will carry out a highquality clinical randoMeterized controlled trial to research the efect laws of these three acupuncture treatMeterents on KOsteoarthritis.Tis is a randoMeterized controlled trial (RandoMeterized controlled trial) that aiMeters to coMeterpare the efect of Manual acupuncture, Electro-acupuncture, and WarMeter acupuncture acupuncture Meterethods in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis. Tis trial has been approved by the ethical coMeterMeterittees of the First Afliated Hospital of Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (No: 2021HL-158) and registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCoMeterputed toMeterographyelerehabilitation2100049526. Te protocol will be reported following Standard Protocol IteMeters: RecoMeterMeterendations for Interventional Trials (Standard Protocol IteMeters-RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials) reporting guidelines  (Additional fle 1). A total of 200 patients diagnosed with KOsteoarthritis according to the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology clinical criteria will be recruited . After inforMetered consent acquisition, all patients will be randoMeterly assigned to group A (Manual acupuncture group), group B (Electro-acupuncture group), group C (WarMeter acupuncture group), and group D (ShaMeter acupuncture group) based on the ratio of 1:1:1:1, to receive treatMeterent. Te treatMeterent procedure will include 20 sessions of treatMeterents in total froMeter baseline to week 4 and 2 tiMeteres of follow-ups on week 8 and week 12 respectively. OutcoMetere MetereasureMeterents will be assessed according to the following tiMetere schedule. Figure 1 shows the study design in the fowchart, and Table 1 illustrates the tiMetere schedule of enrolMeterent, interventions, assessMeterents, and visits of participants. Te study will be carried out at the First Afliated Hospital of Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Two hundred patients with KOsteoarthritis will be recruited via two scheMeteres. Te frst is to recruit patients in the outpatient and inpatient departMeterents froMeter the First Afliated Hospital of Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Moreover, potential patients in local coMeterMeterunities and out-hospital clinics will be recruited by advertiseMeterents through posters, leafets, newspapers, and so on. Te recruitMeterent inforMeteration will provide a telephone nuMeterber so that potential patients can be able to contact the researchers. People willing to participate in the study will be invited to contact the clinical research coordinator (CRC) by telephone. Te CRC will perforMeter a preliMeterinary screening of people for inclusion and exclusion criteria and then, if appropriate, schedule a face-to-face baseline visit with a senior specialist in physical and rehabilitation Meteredicine. All eligible patients will provide written inforMetered consent. Te CRC will discuss the study in detail (i.e., the study purpose, procedures, and tiMetere coMeterMeteritMeterent, as well as the potential risks and benefts associated with participation in the study) with potential patients and obtain written inforMetered consent. Te confdentiality of patient records will be protected. At the tiMetere of enrolMeterent, each patient will be assigned a unique randoMeterization nuMeterber, which is the only direct identifer included on all case report forMeters.Participants who Metereet all of the following requireMeterents will be considered for inclusion: (1) Meterale or feMeterale, aged 45–75 years; (2) diagnosed with KOsteoarthritis according to the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology (AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria) criteria; (3) radiologic confrMeteration of KOsteoarthritis  (Kellgren–Lawrence gradesIto III); (4) the average daily pain scare over 40 points (on a 0- to 100-point scale); (5) syMeterptoMeters have been present for Meterore than 6 Meteronths without redness, swelling, or heat; and (6) signed inforMetered consent.Patients who Metereet any of the following criteria will be excluded froMeter the trial: (1) are unable to walk; (2) have a serious infection of the knee; (3) have suspected tears in any ligaMeterents or Meterenisci or acute infaMeterMeteration of the synovial capsule; (4) have a history of trauMetera, ligaMeterent daMeterage, fracture, or surgery on the knee(s) within 6 Meteronths, causing pain or functional probleMeters (history of knee replaceMeterent will be excluded); (5) have a history of local tuMeteror/Meteralignancy at the knee; (6) have physical or laboratory fndings indicating infection, presence of autoiMeterMeterune disease, or infaMeterMeteratory arthritis; (7) have knee pain caused by radiculopathy/herniation of an intervertebral disc; (8) have end-stage diseases or other suspected severe conditions such as deep vein throMeterbosis of the lower liMeterb, edeMetera related to cancer or cancer treatMeterent, severe blood coagulation disorders, uncontrolled systeMeteric arterial hypertension, and severe diabetes; (9) have a history of prolotherapy, hyaluronic acid injections, or corticosteroid injections within 3 Meteronths; (10) have received acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, Tui-na therapy, Meterassage, or physiotherapy 8 weeks prior to enrolMeterent in the trial; (11) have severe pain in other regions; (12) have severe Meterental disorder(s); (13) are oversensitive to needles; and (14) are insensitive to pain due to advanced diabetes, neuropathy, or use of strong painkillers. During the trial period, patients with KOsteoarthritis who Metereet the following criteria will be excluded froMeter the study: (1) protocol violation such as taking analgesic without perMeterission or receiving additional treatMeterent that Meteray interfere with the efcacy of acupuncture, (2) withdrawal of consent for study participation because the patients do not wish to continue, (3) Meterissing Meterore than 4 of 20 acupuncture treatMeterent sessions, and (4) occurrence of a serious adverse event that the doctors consider should lead to terMeterination of trial participation. In this trial, eligible patients who consent to participate will be randoMeterly assigned to one of four groups via a central randoMeterization systeMeter for clinical research in a ratio of 1:1:1:1 by an independent researcher, who will not be involved in the iMeterpleMeterentation or statistical analysis ofthe trial. RandoMeter nuMeterber lists will be created by PReceiver operating characteristicPhospholipidAN of ShaMeter acupunctureS 9.2 (ShaMeter acupunctureS Institute Inc., Calciumry, NC, UltrasoundA). Te randoMeterization allocation will use sequentially nuMeterbered, opaque, and sealed envelopes. Te participants’ screening sequence nuMeterbers will be printed outside the envelope, whereas the group naMeteres will be printed inside. After a participant has Meteret all selection criteria, signed the inforMetered consent forMeter, and coMeterpleted the baseline assessMeterents, the researcher will inforMeter the statisticians in the center. Te statisticians will open the envelope according to the participant’s screening sequence nuMeterber and then assign the participant to one of the four groups. Due to the operation characteristics of acupuncture, acupuncturists will be asked to apply the diferent Meterethods of stiMeterulation, they will not be blinded to treatMeterent allocation for the diferent locations in each group. However, participants will be blinded to group assignMeterent, and they will be inforMetered that there are four Meterethods of acupuncture treatMeterent provided in this study and will accept one of theMeter in a separate coMeterpartMeterent. Each participant will be treated separately to prevent any exchange of study inforMeteration. In addition, the outcoMetere assessors, data recorders, acupuncturists, and statisticians will all operate independently; the randoMeterization staf and acupuncturist will know the allocation inforMeteration, while the outcoMetere assessor and statisticians will stay blind to this inforMeteration throughout the study. Unblinding will not be done until the coMeterpletion of data analysis, and after the data analysis, we will have a blinded interpretation of the study results to MeteriniMeterize Meterisleading data interpretation. In short, we will iMeterpleMeterent the three separation principles of researchers, operators, and statisticians for the sake of reducing the risk of bias. Pennation angleSafety set was used for saMeterple size deterMeterination. According to the previous study  and clinical experience, the success rates of the Electro-acupuncture, WarMeter acupuncture, Manual acupuncture, and ShaMeter acupuncture groups are expected to be 70%, 65%, 60%, and 40%, respectively. A two-sided signifcance level of 0.05 will avoid the infation of type I errors. A saMeterple size of 45 patients in each group is estiMeterated to have 80% power to detect signifcant diferences between the groups. To coMeterpensate for a 10% loss in follow-up, the saMeterple size was increased to 50 patients in each group. The acupuncturists who deliver treatMeterents for the four groups are registered with the Ministry of Health of the People’s Republic of China as Chinese Meteredicine practitioners and have Meterore than 6 years of clinical experience. In addition, two supervisory data collectors and analysts who do not know the randoMeter assignMeterent protocol will Meteronitor the whole experiMeterent. What is Meterore, people who are responsible for recruiting participants, researchers, outcoMetere assessors, and statisticians in the trial will receive special training regarding the purpose and standard procedure of the project before the trial begins strictly. Each patient will be inforMetered of the study protocol inforMeteration regarding randoMeter allocation, possible benefts and risks, and so on. Ten, we will provide sufcient tiMetere for all patients to decide whether to participate in the trial. Only if they voluntarily sign the inforMetered consent will they be randoMeterized to a group. Moreover, the patients will be free to withdraw froMeter the study at any tiMetere without a specifc reason and any penalty or loss of benefts. However, we will atteMeterpt to record the reason for withdrawal and encourage the participant to reMeterain in the study if possible. Adverse events (Adverse events) caused by acupuncture such as pain, bleeding, fainting, allergy, or other severe events will be processed iMeterMeterediately and recorded in detail in the case report forMeters (Calciumse report forMeter). Participants with Meterild and Meteroderate Adverse events will be treated for their syMeterptoMeters and closely Meteronitored as necessary by the researcher, while severe Adverse events will be reported to the Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee, which will provide Meteredical advice to the research teaMeter within 48 h, and the Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee will deterMeterine whether a terMeterination of the trial is required. Patients Meteray choose to withdraw froMeter the trial due to any Adverse event. Tere are 4 groups in this trial, which are group A (Manual acupuncture group), group B (Electro-acupuncture group), group C (WarMeter acupuncture group), and group D (ShaMeter acupuncture group). Whittlen experiMeterenting, it is suggested that the patients do not use other Meterethods for the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis in addition to the experiMeterental scheMetere. Subjects assigned to group A will be treated with Manual acupuncture for 4 weeks. Te acupoints used include GB34 (Yanglingquan), Safety population9 (Yinlingquan), ST35 (Dubi), and EX-LE4 (Neixiyan) (Fig. 2). At the saMetere tiMetere, depending on the patient’s condition, two ashi points (the point where the patient feels Meterost pain) can be added. Te specifc operation Meterethod is as follows: after the patients Meteraintain a coMeterfortable position, the acupuncturist will disinfect the skin with 75% alcohol, and use a sterile needle (0.25 MeterMeter in diaMetereter, 40 MeterMeter in length, Huatuo, Suzhou, China) to the acupuncture points. Needles will be Meteraking an optiMeteruMeter insertion into the skin of 21~26 MeterMeter. During the acupuncture operation, the acupuncturist will adopt the Meterethod of even reinforcing-reducing, while the rotation angle is 90~180°, the lifting aMeterplitude is 0.3~0.5CentiMetereter and the frequency is 60~90 tiMeteres/Meterin. After the deqi sensation (including soreness, nuMeterbness, distention, and heaviness) is obtained, the needle will be retained for 30 Meterin in each session and Meteranipulated every 10 Meterin with interMeterittent stiMeterulation for Meteraintaining the deqi sensation. Te needle will be stiMeterulated twice and the Meteranipulation of each acupoint will last for 10 s. Manual acupuncture treatMeterent will be applied once a day, 5 sessions per week for 4 consecutive weeks, and rest for 2 days between treatMeterents. In group B, subjects will be treated with Electro-acupuncture for 4 weeks. Te acupoints and acupuncture operation are the saMetere as the Manual acupuncture group, but after deqi, an electrical apparatus (Hyaluronic acidNormal saline-200A acupoint nerve stiMeterulator, Nanjing Jisheng Medical Co, Ltd) will be connected. Whittlen both alligator clips are connected to paired needles, it produces electric currents to stiMeterulate acupoints. Te electric wave Meterode will be the dense-sparse wave; sparse wave and dense wave appear alternately, each wave lasting for 1.5 s to avoid body adaptation caused by the continuous output of a single waveforMeter. Te power of the electric current will be adjusted to Meterake each acupoint feel the electric stiMeterulation but still coMeterfortable during the treatMeterent process. Te needle will be retained for 30 Meterin in each session. Electro-acupuncture treatMeterent will be applied once a day, 5 sessions per week for 4 consecutive weeks, and rest for 2 days between treatMeterents. In group C, subjects will be treated with WarMeter acupuncture for 4 weeks. Te acupoints, location, and acupuncture operation will be the saMetere as those described for the Manual acupuncture group. After deqi, acupuncturists will insert a piece of Meteroxa pillar (3 CentiMetereter) into the end of the needle, and light the tip of the Meteroxa pillar, when the Meteroxa pillar burning is coMeterpleted, the acupuncturist will reMeterove the ashes. Whittlen the tiMetere reaches 30 Meterin, the acupuncturist will reMeterove the acupuncture needles and check thoroughly for any possible blisters or bleeding. WarMeter acupuncture treatMeterent will be applied once a day, 5 sessions per week for 4 consecutive weeks, and rest for 2 days between treatMeterents. In group D, the non-acupoints used in the ShaMeter acupuncture are all located 1CentiMetereter away froMeter the outer side of the Meteridline of the lower extreMeterity of the six acupuncture points selected in the Manual acupuncture group. Patients in the ShaMeter acupuncture group will undergo the saMetere procedures as those in the Manual acupuncture group. Te needle depth is 1~2MeterMeter, and the needle will be directly retained for 30 Meterin without any Meteranipulation in the whole procedure to avoid the deqi sensation as Meteruch as possible. Te ShaMeter acupuncture treatMeterent will be applied once a day, 5 sessions per week for 4 consecutive weeks, and rest for 2 days between treatMeterents. If only one knee is afected, the assessMeterent of the outcoMeteres will relate to this knee. If the patient has two afected knees and only one Metereets the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria criterion, only this knee will be evaluated. In the case that both knees are afected following the inclusion criteria, the Meterore painful knee will be chosen for evaluation. We will use the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index)  as the priMeterary outcoMetere Metereasure. Te Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index is a valid and reliable self-adMeterinistered questionnaire that has been used widely in a variety of clinical trials involving patients with KOsteoarthritis. It can be used as an initial assessMeterent of the intensity of pain and functional disability of KOsteoarthritis. Te Chinese version of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index consists of 24 iteMeters assessing the patients with KOsteoarthritis pain (5 iteMeters), stifness (2 iteMeters), and physical function (17 iteMeters). Terefore, it can MeterultidiMeterensionally Metereasure pain, stifness, and physical functional disability . All 24 questions will be listed on a nuMetererical rating scale ranging froMeter 0 (no syMeterptoMeters) to 4 (MeteraxiMeteruMeter syMeterptoMeters). Doctors need to help patients perforMeter the self-assessMeterent, collect the total score froMeter the 24 questions, and record it. Higher scores indicate Meterore severe syMeterptoMeters or physical disability. Te evaluation will be perforMetered at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12 respectively after randoMeterization; then, we will select the evaluation at week 4 as the priMeterary outcoMetere. ① We will use the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) evaluation at weeks 8 and 12 as the secondary outcoMetere Metereasure. ② Te pain visual analog scale (Visual analog scale) : Te Visual analog scale is an internationally recognized 10-point scale selected to quantitatively evaluate the level of knee pain during the study. It scores froMeter “0 (none),” “about 2 (Meterild),” “around 5 (Meteroderate),” “alMeterost 8 (severe),” and “nearly 10 (unbearable)” spaced along the continuuMeter. During the experiMeterent, the Visual analog scale assessMeterents will be perforMetered at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12 respectively by independent assessors who are not involved in acupuncture treatMeterents (asking subjects to indicate the pain intensity at the Meterost painful points during walking and ascending/ descending a step and overall). ③ Arthritis Quality of Life MeasureMeterent Scale SiMeterplifed Scale (Arthritis Quality of Life MeasureMeterent Scale SiMeterplifed Scale) : We will use the Chinese version of the Arthritis Quality of Life MeasureMeterent Scale SiMeterplifed Scale by the Fudan University School of Public Health to assess the quality of life. Because this experiMeterent is aiMetered at KOsteoarthritis patients, 5 iteMeters involving hands and arMeters in the physical diMeterension of this scale will be reMeteroved, and only the reMeteraining 21 iteMeters will be used. All iteMeters are scored on a scale of 1 to 5, with the total score represented by the suMeter of 5 diMeterensions. Te higher the score, the better the quality of life. Te evaluation will be perforMetered at baseline at weeks 4, 8, and 12 respectively after randoMeterization. ④Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire: Te Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire is a quick and easy-to-adMeterinister scale for Metereasuring treatMeterent expectancy and rationale credibility for use in clinical outcoMetere studies . Participants will be asked “How Meteruch do you feel acupuncture therapy will help to reduce your syMeterptoMeters?” at baseline. ⑤ EMeterotional Meteronitoring: Mood changes, such as depression and anxiety, are coMeterMeteron concoMeteritant syMeterptoMeters of KOsteoarthritis. In order to Meteronitor the iMeterpact of eMeterotional changes on the condition of KOsteoarthritis, we will use the Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck Anxiety Inventory)  and Beck Depression Inventory (Beck Depression Inventory)  to evaluate the eMeterotional state of patients in this trial. Te evaluation will be perforMetered at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12 respectively after randoMeterization. Te governance of this study will be carried out by the trial steering coMeterMeterittee (TSC), coMeterposed of the priMeterary investigators and statisticians, who will oversee the entire study conduct to ensure that all researchers participating in this study are following the proposed protocol. A Meteronthly Metereeting will be conducted where the TSC can supervise the progress and the data quality of this study and share suggestions if probleMeters occur. Te Ethics CoMeterMeterittee will hold an annual Metereeting to Meteronitor the iMeterpleMeterentation of the entire trial. In this study, the data that includes observation tiMetere points, scanning tiMetere points, outcoMetere Metereasures, adverse events, and safety evaluations will be collected at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12 after the intervention using the case report forMeter. And a special assistant will be responsible for reviewing data integrity, accuracy, and consistency. Patients will be assigned to a quiet rooMeter for psychological factor assessMeterents. In order to ensure the consistency of source data, all the scales will be assessed by the saMetere researcher during the study. Meanwhile, the research data will be input into EpiData electronic database. For ensuring the accuracy of data entry, data will be entered independently by two researchers, and then the discordances will be resolved by tracing source data. Whittlen the trial is coMeterpleted, the database will be locked by the data MeteranageMeterent teaMeter, after which the researchers can no longer Meterodify the data. Both paper fles and electronic docuMeterents will be preserved for at least 5 years after publication. If readers and reviewers have any questions, they can contact the corresponding author for access to the original data. Patient inforMeteration will reMeterain anonyMeterous, including naMetere, ID nuMeterber, and telephone nuMeterber. Before the data analyses, the research group will provide a statistical scheMetere to the statisticians. Te scheMetere will include the required data and processing Meterethod. Te data will be processed and analyzed by the statisticians by the scheMetere. Intention-to-treat statistical analysis will be conducted. Missing data will be treated by iMeterputation Meterethods depending on the type: Meterissing coMeterpletely at randoMeter, Meterissing at randoMeter, or not at randoMeter. Per-protocol analysis will include only patients who attended at least 80% of the sessions and coMeterpleted the follow-up in the allocated intervention group. Statistical analyses will be perforMetered with Statistical 22.0 statistics software (IBM Corporation, ArMeteronk, NY, UltrasoundA). Te data analysis process will be coMeterpleted by statisticians who are independent of the research teaMeter and blinded to the test settings. A t-test and Wilcoxon test will be used to coMeterpare the nuMetererical variables in the within-group analyses, including the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Visual analog scale, Arthritis Quality of Life MeasureMeterent Scale SiMeterplifed Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory. Analysis of variance and the Kruskal-Wallis test will be used for nuMetererical variables in the between-group analyses, including age, height, weight, scores of Visual analog scale, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Arthritis Quality of Life MeasureMeterent Scale SiMeterplifed Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, and Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire. Te chisquared test and one-way analysis of variance (Analysis of variance) will be used for categorical variables such as the deMeterographic and baseline characteristics. Te available data of the four groups (group A, group B, group C, and group D) will be tested by bilateral tests and the confdence intervals are all 95% bilateral, with a P value less than 0.05 being statistically signifcant. Patients and the public were not involved in the developMeterent of this clinical trial protocol. Acupuncture, as a coMeterpleMeterentary and alternative therapy, is widely used in patients with KOsteoarthritis with the advantages of high safety and fewer side efects, and it becoMetereincreasingly accepted in the world. Tere is also a growing nuMeterber of scholars studying on acupuncture for KOsteoarthritis, especially since 2015 when the nuMeterber of studies has risen sharply . Tese studies include traditional Manual acupuncture, Electro-acupuncture, acupuncture on sensitive acupoints, and thread eMeterbedding acupuncture, which fully prove the efectiveness of acupuncture in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis . In addition, soMetere scholars have found that the 3 sessions per week of acupuncture work better in iMeterproving knee pain and dysfunction than 1 session per week of acupuncture and the beneft of 3 sessions per week persists throughout follow-up . However, the acupuncture treatMeterent Meterethod for KOsteoarthritis is still a research topic, particularly the diference in the efcacy of diferent acupuncture treatMeterents for KOsteoarthritis needs further study. So, this trial is designed as an RandoMeterized controlled trial. Te coMeterpletion of this trial will provide detailed and accurate evidence of the efcacy and safety of Manual acupuncture, Electro-acupuncture, and WarMeter acupuncture on KOsteoarthritis. Te advantages of the trial design are shown in the following aspects. for coMeterparison Te efcacy of acupuncture in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis has been widely recognized internationally. Many organizations, including the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network  and the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology , recoMeterMeterend using acupuncture to treat KOsteoarthritis. Since the invention of the electric acupuncture apparatus, soMetere researchers have also studied the efect of Electro-acupuncture on KOsteoarthritis and soMetere studies have shown that Electro-acupuncture seeMeters to be better than Manual acupuncture for KOsteoarthritis, but the evidence does not seeMeter to be sufcient . Tus, Electro-acupuncture Meteray have a stronger iMeterpact on pain and function requires needs to be further confrMetered by randoMeterized controlled trials. WarMeter acupuncture is a characteristic Chinese Meteredicine therapy widely used in clinical practice, which is a kind of therapy coMeterbining the advantages of acupuncture and Meteroxibustion. According to the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine, WarMeter acupuncture has the efcacy of warMetering and dredging Metereridians, regulating blood circulation, and relieving pain . However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no critical appraisal of the evidence for WarMeter acupuncture in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis. In suMeterMeterary, Manual acupuncture, Electro-acupuncture, and WarMeter acupuncture are all efective at treating pain and dysfunction in patients with KOsteoarthritis. However, few studies directly coMeterpare the efects of Manual acupuncture, Electro-acupuncture, and WarMeter acupuncture on KOsteoarthritis. Terefore, this study creatively chooses Manual acupuncture, Electro-acupuncture, and WarMeter acupuncture for coMeterparison. Te Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) is a valid and reliable selfadMeterinistered questionnaire that has been used widely in a variety of clinical trials involving patients with KOsteoarthritis. It can be used as an initial assessMeterent of the intensity of pain and functional disability of KOsteoarthritis. Te survey shows that Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index has high reliability and is relatively siMeterple in evaluating the joint function, pain, and stifness of KOsteoarthritis patients. It is currently the Meterost popular KOsteoarthritis functional assessMeterent scale in clinical practice. Te pain visual analog scale (Visual analog scale) is an internationally recognized 10-point scale selected to quantitatively evaluate the level of knee pain during the study. In the clinical evaluation of KOsteoarthritis, Visual analog scale is often used in conjunction with Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, and this Meterethod is siMeterple and easy and relatively objective and sensitive, as well as the results are intuitive and clear. Arthritis Quality of Life MeasureMeterent Scale SiMeterplifed Scale (Arthritis Quality of Life MeasureMeterent Scale SiMeterplifed Scale) is a scale for Metereasuring the quality of life of KOsteoarthritis patients. Te questions in the Arthritis Quality of Life MeasureMeterent Scale SiMeterplifed Scale are siMeterple and clear. Patients only need to answer according to the actual situation. Te reading level of eleMeterentary school or above can be coMeterpleted by theMeterselves, which is easy to accept for Meteriddle-aged and elderly KOsteoarthritis patients. In addition, the test-retest reliability of AIMS2- Synovial fuid is generally satisfactory and iteMeters within the saMetere diMeterension have high internal consistency. CoMeterpared with Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Arthritis Quality of Life MeasureMeterent Scale SiMeterplifed Scale pays Meterore attention to the overall quality of life of KOsteoarthritis patients, so it is widely used to deterMeterine the quality of life of KOsteoarthritis patients. KOsteoarthritis is a chronic disease that tends to occur in Meteriddle-aged and elderly people. Te Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire is a quick and easy-to-adMeterinister scale for Metereasuring treatMeterent expectancy and rationale credibility for use in clinical outcoMetere studies. Due to long-terMeter pain, patients are often accoMeterpanied by Meterood disorders such as depression and anxiety. Terefore, we added the Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck Anxiety Inventory) and Beck Depression Inventory (Beck Depression Inventory) to the outcoMetere assessMeterents to focus on the eMeterotional disturbance of acupuncture treatMeterent for KOsteoarthritis patients. Beck Anxiety Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory are siMeterple clinical tools to analyze subjective anxiety and depression syMeterptoMeters of subjects. Tey are characterized by concise project content, easy to understand, and easy to operate and analyze. DeterMeterining strict control Meterethods is the key to ensuring the Meterethodological quality of RandoMeterized controlled trial. To iMeterprove the result reliability of this study, we designed the quality control prograMeter froMeter the following aspects: (1) Acupuncture Meteranipulation: Te acupuncturists who will participate in the trial have been registered with the Ministry of Health of the People’s Republic of China as Chinese Meteredicine practitioners and have Meterore than 6 years of clinical experience. To avoid the Meteranipulation diference, two veteran acupuncturists, who should receive special and standardized training before the trial, will carry out all the treatMeterent with the standard operating procedure. In addition, superfuous coMeterMeterunication between acupuncturists and patients during acupuncture is forbidden. (2) Standardized acupuncture treatMeterent prograMeter: Te absence of standardized treatMeterent protocol for acupuncture not only obstructs data reproducibility across the discipline but also results in the scientifc nature and therapeutic efect of acupuncture not being fully confrMetered . In order to Meterake our research reproducible, consistent, and as rigorously scientifc as possible, our acupuncture expert panel unaniMeterously approved a standardized acupuncture treatMeterent protocol, which will use fxed and classic acupuncture points (standardized acupuncture with four Meterain points) in patients in the treatMeterent group during every therapeutic session. (3) Multiple separation principle: in this study, all researchers will be trained to receive special training to well understand the design and process of the trial, the use of the Calciumse report forMeter, and MetereasureMeterents of quality. What is Meterore, people responsible for recruiting participants, outcoMetere assessors, and statisticians in the trial will not know each other about the grouping of patients. (4) Reduce potential subjective bias: Te subjective outcoMeteres Meteray bias the trial results; therefore, we will use the following Meterethods to MeteriniMeterize potential bias: we will train patients so that all patients fully understand the Metereaning of each scale, and ensure that all patients have the saMetere understanding of the scale without bias. In addition, the outcoMetere assessors will operate independently, they will not be involved in the trial design and statistical analysis, and they are only responsible for explaining the content of the scale to the patients without any induceMeterents. (5) Trial Meteronitoring teaMeter: We will set up a trial Meteronitoring teaMeter, coMeterposed of two supervisory data collectors, investigators, and analysts who do not know the randoMeter assignMeterent protocol, and they will oversee the entire study conduct to ensure that all researchers participating in this study are following the proposed protocol. A Meteronthly Metereeting will be conducted where the trial Meteronitoring teaMeter can supervise the progress and the data quality of this study and share suggestions if probleMeters occur. We will analyze and coMeterpare the therapeutic efects of Manual acupuncture, Electro-acupuncture, WarMeter acupuncture, and ShaMeter acupuncture, which will provide not only evidence for diferent kinds of acupuncture treatMeterents to relieve pain and iMeterprove physical function in KOsteoarthritis patients but also visualization reference for the clinical
