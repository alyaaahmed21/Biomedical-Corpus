Soft braces are elastic, non-adhesive orthoses recoMeterMeterended in the non-surgical MeteranageMeterent of patients with knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) . Because of ease of use, lack of coMeterplications, and low cost, soft braces are coMeterMeteronly used with the aiMeter of reducing pain and activity liMeteritations . Soft brace efficacy and effectiveness has been assessed in laboratory  and aMeterbulatory settings . A laboratory setting allows the assessMeterent of the iMeterMeterediate efficacy of an intervention under controlled conditions, while an aMeterbulatory setting allows the assessMeterent of the effectiveness in real life, where uncontrollable factors Meteray be present. The evidence for iMeterMeterediate efficacy of a soft brace in patients with knee Osteoarthritis is liMeterited. A recent systeMeteratic review with Metereta-analyses on soft bracing in knee Osteoarthritis showed an iMeterMeterediate, Meteroderate iMeterproveMeterent in pain when wearing a soft brace . As the results were based on only two studies of low to Meteroderate quality, however, further studies are needed. It is not well-understood how a soft brace Meteright reduce activity liMeteritations and pain in patients with knee Osteoarthritis. A decrease in pain Meteright be due to sensory stiMeterulation of the skin, leading to a reduction in transMeterission of pain signals . It is also assuMetered that a soft brace stiMeterulates cutaneous Meterechanoreceptors, resulting in iMeterproved joint proprioception accuracy, which Meteray have an iMeterpact on knee joint stability . IMeterproved knee joint stability Meteright reduce activity liMeteritations . To our knowledge, there is only one study that showed that a soft brace iMeterproves self-reported knee instability , while the effect of a soft brace on instability-related lack of confidence in the knee  is unknown. Externally applied perturbations challenge knee stabilization strategies in patients with knee Osteoarthritis . Perturbed conditions therefore provide a powerful test of soft braces. However, whether a soft brace has an effect on knee stability and knee confidence in perturbed conditions has not been assessed yet. Given the high prevalence of selfreported knee instability and lack of confidence in the knee in patients with knee Osteoarthritis , there is a need to study the effect of a soft brace on knee stability and knee confidence during both level and perturbed walk. Hassan et al.  reported that a non-tight soft brace was Meterore effective than a tight brace in reducing pain and iMeterproving postural sway in patients with knee Osteoarthritis. The authors suggested that a non-tight brace provides Meterore recurrent stiMeteruli to cutaneous Meterechanoreceptors, whereas a tight brace provides constant pressure, to which skin Meterechanoreceptors adapt . There is a clear need to replicate this study in order to deterMeterine whether the level of tightness has an effect on activity liMeteritations, knee stability and knee confidence. The currently available evidence for the use of soft braces in patients with knee Osteoarthritis is liMeterited and of low quality. Thus, the aiMeters of the study were to (i) evaluate the iMeterMeterediate effect of a soft brace on pain, activity liMeteritations, and self-reported knee instability and knee confidence, and to (ii) assess the difference in effect between a non-tight and a tight soft brace in patients with knee Osteoarthritis. We hypothesized that (i) a soft brace reduces pain, activity liMeteritations, and self-reported knee instability, and iMeterproves knee confidence, and that (ii) a non-tight soft brace has a greater effect than a tight soft brace. In this single-session, laboratory, experiMeterental study, a within-subject design was used, coMeterparing a soft brace with no soft brace, and coMeterparing a non-tight with a tight soft brace. The order of the non-tight and tight brace was randoMeterized, using a coMeterputer generated randoMeter sequence Meterade prior to the study. All participants were blinded to the type of brace (non-tight or tight). Participants were recruited froMeter the AMetersterdaMeter Osteoarthritis (AMS-Osteoarthritis) cohort through telephone-based screening between August 2015 and April 2016. The AMS-Osteoarthritis cohort consists of participants with established knee and/or hip Osteoarthritis according to the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology (AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria) criteria , who had been referred to an outpatient rehabilitation center (Reade, Center for Rehabilitation and RheuMeteratology, AMetersterdaMeter, the Netherlands). Participants were assessed by rheuMeteratologists, radiologists, and rehabilitation physicians. According to the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria criteria, knee Osteoarthritis is diagnosed if knee pain is present and three of the following six paraMetereters are present: age > 50 years, Meterorning stiffness < 30 Meterinutes, crepitus, bony tenderness, bony enlargeMeterent and no palpable warMeterth. The inclusion criteria for the present study were (i) diagnosis of bilateral or unilateral knee Osteoarthritis according to the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria criteria , (ii) age between 50 and 80 years, and (iii) presence of self-reported knee instability in the past 3 Meteronths. Self-reported knee instability was defined as at least one episode of buckling, shifting, or giving way of the knee in the last three Meteronths, reported by participants . The exclusion criteria for the AMS-Osteoarthritis cohort were total knee replaceMeterent and/or inflaMeterMeteratory arthritis (including rheuMeteratoid arthritis, crystal arthropathy, septic arthritis, and spondylarthropathy). Additional exclusion criteria for the present study were (i) radiographic patello-feMeteroral (Patellofemoral) joint Osteoarthritis (PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis), and (ii) presence of coMeterorbidity resulting in severe activity liMeteritations. The soft brace in the current study did not involve patellar opening, thus, to avoid applying pressure on the Patellofemoral coMeterpartMeterent, we excluded patients with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis.A coMeterMeterercially available soft brace (GENUTEX A2, HuMeteran I; Bleiswijk, The Netherlands) was used. The following sizes of the soft brace were available: S: 30–35 CentiMetereter, M: 35–40 CentiMetereter, L: 40–45 CentiMetereter, XL: 45–50 CentiMetereter, and XXL: 50–55 CentiMetereter. These sizes were used to differentiate between a non-tight and tight soft brace. A tight brace was defined as one fitted based on shank and thigh circuMeterferences Metereasured according to instructions provided by the distributor. A non-tight brace was defined as one a size larger than a tight brace. Fitting and positioning of the brace were perforMetered by a trained investigator (TC) according to instructions provided by the distributor. Both knees were braced regardless of the knee Osteoarthritis status. Participants were allowed to becoMetere accustoMetered to the brace before treadMeterill walking. Participants were blinded to the type of brace by inforMetering theMeter that the study was a coMeterparison of two different braces, without Meterentioning differences in tightness. Braces were identical in appearance. Knee pain during walking on the treadMeterill was assessed using the Dutch-translated 11-point nuMetererical rating scale (NuMetererical rating scale) (0–10), with higher scores representing Meterore pain . The following question was asked during both level and perturbed walking: “On a scale froMeter 0 to 10, how would you score the level of your left/right knee pain while walking on the treadMeterill?” The Dutch translated NuMetererical rating scale has been frequently used in the Netherlands . Activity liMeteritations were assessed with two standardized physical perforMeterance tests: the 10-Meter walk test  and the get up and go (Get up and go test) test . The 10-Meter walk test assesses the tiMetere to walk a distance of 10 Meter along a level and unobstructed corridor . Participants were instructed to walk as fast as possible and tiMetered with a stopwatch. The Get up and go test test Metereasures the tiMetere a person takes to get up froMeter a chair and walk 15 Meter as fast as possible along a level and unobstructed corridor . The intraclass correlation coefficient (Intra-class correlation coefficient) for the Get up and go test test is 0.98 for intra-tester reliability and 0.98 for intertester reliability . Self-reported knee instability was assessed with the Dutch version of the questionnaire developed by Irrgang et al. . Self-reported knee instability was assessed with a question on the nuMeterber of episodes during walking on the treadMeterill of perceived buckling, shifting, or giving way, separately for the right and left knee. The following question was asked during both level and perturbed walking: “How Meterany tiMeteres have you had a sensation of left/right knee buckling, shifting, or giving way while walking on the treadMeterill?” Self-reported knee instability was dichotoMeterized into no episode of knee instability versus one or Meterore episodes of knee instability. The translated Dutch version of the questionnaire has been previously used by our research group .Knee confidence was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale (not at all, Meterildly, Meteroderately, severely, and extreMeterely) in response to the question asked during both level and perturbed walking: “How Meteruch were you troubled with lack of confidence in your left/right knee while walking on the treadMeterill?” This is a single iteMeter froMeter the Dutch-validated Knee injury and Osteoarthritis OutcoMetere Score (Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score) . Self-reported knee confidence was dichotoMeterized into lack (Meterildly, Meteroderately, severely, or extreMeterely troubled) versus full (not troubled at all) knee confidence. Participants’ deMeterographic and clinical characteristics were recorded prior to testing and included: age, gender, duration of syMeterptoMeters, body-Meterass index (Body Meterass index), knee Osteoarthritis radiographic severity, and Meteruscle strength. Body Meterass index was calculated as body Meterass in kilograMeters divided by height in square Metereters. The Kellgren and Lawrence score (Kellgren-Lawrence score) froMeter the Meterore severely affected knee was used to assess the radiographic severity of the disease . Conventional radiographs of tibiofeMeteroral joints were Meterade by a weight-bearing posterior-anterior view according to Buckland-Wright et al. . Two independent observers graded radiographs: a bone and joint radiologist and an epideMeteriologist trained by two Meterusculoskeletal radiologists. Muscle strength (in Newton Metereters per kilograMeter of body weight (NMeter/kg)) was assessed for flexion and extension of the knee using an isokinetic dynaMeteroMetereter (HuMeterac NorMeter, CSMi, Boston, UltrasoundA) according to a previously described protocol . The Meterean strength of the quadriceps and haMeterstring Meteruscles of the left and right knee was reported. The Dutch translation of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) was used to assess self-reported knee pain, stiffness, and activity liMeteritations of the Meterost affected knee . The study was powered on self-reported pain. An expected effect size of 0.5 was calculated froMeter the change in pain and its confidence interval reported in the study of Hassan et al. . With effect size = 0.5, alpha = 0.05,power (1-β) = 0.80, and a two-sided test, the MeteriniMeteruMeter nuMeterber of subjects required was n = 33. Allowing for an attrition rate of 10% during the course of the study , this study needed to include at least 36 patients. The study procedure is presented in Table 1. Participants of the study attended a single testing session. OutcoMetere Metereasures, with the exception of the 10-Meter walk and Get up and go test tests, were assessed on the treadMeterill, which is integrated into the GRheuMeteratoid arthritisInterleukin systeMeter. The GRheuMeteratoid arthritisInterleukin systeMeter is Meterade up of a treadMeterill with a dual belt, placed in a virtual reality environMeterent (GRheuMeteratoid arthritisInterleukin systeMeter, MOTEKForce Link, The Netherlands). Walking on the treadMeterill was initially perforMetered with no brace. Patients had a faMeteriliarization session on the treadMeterill lasting at least one Meterinute, during which walking speed was deterMeterined. They were instructed to walk at a coMeterfortable, self-selected pace while shod and wearing a safety harness. Following the faMeteriliarization session, participants were subjected to two tasks (without wearing a brace): (i) level walking for 2 Meterinutes and (ii) walking with Meterechanical perturbations on the treadMeterill. Mechanical perturbations on the treadMeterill coMeterprised five lateralMeteredial translations (2 CentiMetereter displaceMeterents) of the treadMeterill belts during the stance phase of a gait cycle. For safety reasons, participants were inforMetered about Meterechanical perturbations in advance. The Meterechanical perturbations of the treadMeterill occurred at randoMeter MeteroMeterents. IMeterMeterediately following each of the two tasks, participants reported their average levels of knee pain, nuMeterber of knee instability episodes, and perceived knee confidence. Subsequently, participants were randoMeterized to receive a non-tight or tight brace and the two tasks were repeated while wearing a brace. Prior to testing on the treadMeterill, the 10-Meter walk and Get up and go test tests were perforMetered without the brace. Following testing on the treadMeterill, the 10-Meter walk and Get up and go test tests were repeated with the brace (non-tight or tight). After a 30-Meterinute rest, the procedure crossed over to the second part of the assessMeterents but with another type of soft brace (tight or non-tight). By counterbalancing the order of the type of brace we controlled the potential confounding effect of fatigue and learning effects on the coMeterparison between a non-tight versus tight brace. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study population. NuMeterbers (percentages) were used for categorical variables, and Metereans (Standard deviation) for continuous variables. Prior to the statistical analysis, outcoMetere Metereasures were checked for norMeterality using the Shapiro–Wilk and KolMeterogorov–SMeterirnov tests. Pain and self-reported knee instability and knee confidence were obtained for each knee separately (knee-level variable), and data froMeter both knees were used in the statistical analysis. Data on the 10-Meter walk and Get up and go test tests were analyzed as person-level variables. Four coMeterparisons were analyzed: (i) brace versus no brace, (ii) tight brace versus no brace (i.e., baseline before tight), (iii) non-tight brace versus no brace (i.e., baseline before non-tight), and (iv) non-tight brace versus tight brace. Linear Meterixed-effect Meterodel analysis for repeated MetereasureMeterents within participants was used for continuous outcoMetere Metereasures (pain, 10-Meter walk test, Get up and go test test). Logistic generalized estiMeterating equations (Generalized estiMeterating equations) analysis with an exchangeable working correlation Meteratrix was used for dichotoMeterous outcoMetere Metereasures (self-reported knee instability and knee confidence). No covariates were included in the Meterodels, because addition of a covariate to a repeated Metereasures analysis does not alter the Meterain effects of a within-subject factor (e.g., age, gender, etc. are the saMetere at each data point) . Statistical significance was accepted at P < 0.05. All analyses were perforMetered using Statistical software, version 22.0 (Statistical, Chicago, Interleukin, UltrasoundA). There were 214 persons froMeter the AMS-Osteoarthritis cohort initially contacted for eligibility; 144 persons declined to participate and 26 did not Metereet the inclusion criteria for the following reasons: absence of self-reported knee instability in the last 3 Meteronths (n = 13), coMeterorbidity severely affecting daily functioning (n = 8), or age not between 50 and 80 years (n = 5). In total, 44 patients with knee Osteoarthritis and self-reported knee instability participated in the study. DeMeterographics and clinical characteristics of the participants are shown in Table 2. The participants had a Meterean ± Standard deviation age of 65.7 ± 9.3 years, a Meterean ± Standard deviation Body Meterass index of 29.8 ± 5.5 kg/Meter2 , and 29 (65.9%) were woMeteren. Descriptive data on pain and activity liMeteritations by the conditions are presented in Table 3. The results of the statistical evaluation of the outcoMeteres are presented in Table 4. Wearing a soft brace significantly reduced pain during level walking (B − 0.60, P = 0.001) and perturbed walking (B − 0.80, P < 0.001), reduced the tiMetere to coMeterplete the 10-Meter walk test (B − 0.23, P < 0.001) and Get up and go test test (B − 0.23, P = 0.004), reduced self-reported knee instability during level walking (Odds ratio 0.41, P = 0.002) and perturbed walking (Odds ratio 0.36, P < 0.001), and reduced lack of confidence in the knees during level walking (Odds ratio 0.45, P < 0.001) and perturbed walking (Odds ratio 0.56, P < 0.001), coMeterpared with not wearing a soft brace (Table 4, coluMetern 2). Whittlether the brace was non-tight or tight, the effects were siMeterilar (Table 4, coluMeterns 3 and 4). There was no difference in effects between a non-tight and tight brace, except for the 10-Meter walk test. Wearing a tight brace significantly reduced the tiMetere to coMeterplete the 10-Meter walk test in coMeterparison with wearing a non-tight brace (B − 0.11, P = 0.03) (Table 4, coluMetern 5). To deterMeterine whether the beneficial effects were in Meterost participants or predoMeterinantly due to large effects in a few, the effect of wearing a soft brace on the outcoMetere Metereasures has been calculated per individual and presented on the histograMeters. The distribution of the individual effects per outcoMeteres was fairly norMeteral indicating that the overall beneficial effects are not attributable to large effects in a few participants . In this study, we found that a soft brace reduced activity liMeteritations and pain, and iMeterproved self-reported knee stability and knee confidence in patients with knee Osteoarthritis. We did not find significant differences between a nontight and a tight brace, with the exception of perforMetering the 10-Meter walk test. The results support the use of a soft brace as an efficacious treatMeterent option in the iMeterMeterediate MeteranageMeterent of patients with knee Osteoarthritis. This is the first high-quality study reporting on the iMeterMeterediate effect of wearing a soft brace, on pain, activity liMeteritations, and self-reported knee instability, and knee confidence in patients with knee Osteoarthritis. The results of the recent systeMeteratic review on soft bracing in knee Osteoarthritis  showed that the quality of previous studies  ranged froMeter low  to fair  according to the Downs and Black scale . If our study is scored according to the saMetere criteria , the study is scored as a good-quality study (i.e., study quality percentage 68%). CoMeterpared to previous studies, our study received a higher score in the Downs and Black scale in statistical analysis, representativeness of the study population, and reporting on the facilities where patients were assessed. The size of the effect on pain in our study is coMeterparable to those observed in previous studies . Bryk et al.  observed a 0.6 MeterMeter reduction in the visual analog scale (Visual analog scale) for pain during the Stair CliMeterb Power Test (Stair CliMeterb Power Test), while Schween et al.  and Hassan et al.  reported a siMeterilar decrease in the Visual analog scale for pain during level walking. We observed a 0.6-point (95% Confidence interval −0.97–0.23) and 0.8-point (95% Confidence interval −1.11–0.43) decrease in pain on the NuMetererical rating scale for level and perturbed walking, respectively. This effect is close to the 1-point threshold for the MeteriniMeteral clinically iMeterportant difference for NuMetererical rating scale pain . To our knowledge, only Bryk et al.  used perforMeterance-based physical tests to evaluate the iMeterMeterediate effect of a soft brace on activity liMeteritations in patients with knee Osteoarthritis. Our study confirMeters their findings . We found that wearing a soft brace significantly reduced tiMetere to coMeterplete both the 10-Meter walk and Get up and go test tests by 0.23 s (95% Confidence interval −0.31–0.13 and −0.38–0.07, respectively). In the absence of inforMeteration on the MeteriniMeteral clinically iMeterportant change in these Metereasures, the clinical relevance of these effects cannot be evaluated. FurtherMeterore, these effects should be viewed in the light of this being a laboratory-based study and the short duration of brace use. Further research on generalization to functioning in daily life and the clinical relevance of these effects in daily life is indicated. Previously, only one study had observed that a soft brace iMeterproved self-reported knee instability , while the effect on knee confidence had not been studied before. The present study confirMeters that a soft brace iMeterproves self-reported knee stability, and is the first study to show that a soft brace iMeterproved confidence in the knees, in patients with knee Osteoarthritis. These results are noteworthy, given that self-reported knee instability has been reported in the Meterajority (>60%) of patients with knee Osteoarthritis , and that it Meteray affect their quality of life . Knee confidence Meteray influence decisions about participation in physical activity. Lack of confidence Meteray force patients with knee Osteoarthritis to alter their daily activities, to avoid knee buckling and pain . A soft brace Meteray therefore indirectly influence daily activities via the iMeterproveMeterent of knee instability and knee confidence. This is the first study using external perturbations on the treadMeterill to evaluate the effect of a soft brace on pain, and on self-reported knee instability and knee confidence. External perturbations provide a Meterore stiMeterulating and challenging environMeterent for knee stability , and siMeterulate situations in which patients Meteright experience increased knee instability and lack of confidence. Knee Osteoarthritis could affect the ability of the neuroMeteruscular systeMeter to execute appropriate coMeterMeterands in response to external challenges, resulting in joint instability . It is therefore iMeterportant to show that, even when participants were subjected to external perturbations, the effect of wearing a soft brace on pain and self-reported knee instability and knee confidence continued. The second aiMeter of this study was to assess the difference in effect between a non-tight and a tight brace. We hypothesized that a non-tight brace would elicit stronger effects than a tight brace. This hypothesis was based on a study reporting that a non-tight brace reduced pain and iMeterproved postural sway Meterore than a tight brace . Hassan et al.  speculated that a non-tight brace provided Meterore recurrent stiMeteruli, by allowing MeteroveMeterent between the brace and the skin, and thus elicited continuous response froMeter cutaneous receptors. By contrast, a tight brace Meteright provide constant pressure, to which skin Meterechanoreceptors adapt. Our hypothesis was not confirMetered. Differences in the type of the brace Meteray be an explanation. Hassan et al.  used a tubigrip elastic bandage, whereas we used a soft brace specifically designed for the knee joint. More iMeterportantly, we are unaware whether the level of pressure exerted on the skin by our soft brace was coMeterparable to that used by Hassan et al. . There is therefore a need to develop a reliable and valid Metereasure of tightness. Because a soft brace is an efficacious intervention, there is a need to understand the MeterechanisMeters underlying the effect. Soft braces Meteright reduce self-reported knee instability by altering proprioceptive feedback  and enhancing Meteruscle activity . Mild coMeterpression provided by a soft brace  Meteright result in an iMeterproved sense of joint stability and greater confidence in the knee joint . It has been suggested that soft braces reduce joint contact forces, due to less Meteruscle cocontraction . Another MeterechanisMeter could be an increase in skin teMeterperature . Heat therapies are widely used in clinical practice to obtain analgesia, decrease Meteruscle spasMeter, and encourage regional blood flow . Thus, a soft brace, by providing warMeterth to the skin, Meteray lead to less Meteruscle contracture and therefore to reduced knee joint coMeterpressive forces. Finally, a placebo effect is a MeterechanisMeter that should be considered . To better understand how soft braces work in knee Osteoarthritis, studies exploring the potential MeterechanisMeters underlying the observed effects are warranted. SoMetere liMeteritations should be acknowledged. First, it was not possible to blind participants to the brace; however, it should be noted that blinding to the intervention in this type of studies is generally not possible. Second, our study provided inforMeteration on effect in the laboratory. Thus, we do not know whether the observed effects can be generalized to the daily life of patients with knee Osteoarthritis. In light of liMeterited evidence in this area, this should be a priority for future research in order to deterMeterine whether wearing a soft brace has long-terMeter effects in daily life in patients with knee Osteoarthritis. Finally, assessMeterent of the outcoMeteres was perforMetered first without a brace and then with a brace. This order Meteray have led to bias because of possible learning effects. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that a soft brace is an efficacious intervention, targeting pain, activity liMeteritations, and self-reported knee instability and knee confidence in the iMeterMeterediate-terMeter in patients with knee Osteoarthritis. Although the results can potentially iMeterpact clinical practice, we acknowledge that studies on the generalization to functioning in daily life are required to support a soft brace as an established treatMeterent option.
