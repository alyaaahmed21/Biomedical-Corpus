One of the Meterost prevalent conditions that afects Meteriddle-aged and elderly patients with pain and functional liMeteritations is knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis), which places a heavy fnancial burden on patients, faMeterilies, and society . More than 250 Meterillion people worldwide are afected by KOsteoarthritis, and especially older adults over 60 have Meterore severe syMeterptoMeters of KOsteoarthritis . Te current treatMeterent options for KOsteoarthritis include joint replaceMeterent, physical therapy, Meteredication therapy, and health education . Te Meterain goals are to reduce discoMeterfort and enhance joint perforMeterance. But the current treatMeterent approaches are still inadequate . Platelet-rich plasMetera (Platelet-rich plasma) is platelet concentrate obtained by centrifugation of autologous blood, and it is widely used in regenerative Meteredicine . Platelet-rich plasma is rich in growth factors, such as transforMetering growth factor (TransgenicF-β), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin growth factor (IGF), epiderMeteral growth factor (EGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) . Platelet-rich plasma can control iMeterMeterunological and infaMeterMeteratory reactions as well as aid in the regeneration and repair of blood vessels and tissues . Basic study deMeteronstrates that the MeterechanisMeter of Platelet-rich plasma applied to repair cartilage daMeterage includes enhancing cartilage bioMeterechanical qualities, stiMeterulating chondrocyte proliferation, and increasing extracellular Meteratrix forMeteration . Additionally, Platelet-rich plasma can successfully restore daMeteraged bone and cartilage, according to clinical studies . Chu et al. perforMetered a prospective, parallel-group, double-blind, Meterulti-center, shaMeter-controlled randoMeterized clinical trial deMeteronstrated that Platelet-rich plasma was superior to shaMeter saline in treating KOsteoarthritis . Also, there is solid evidence for the therapy of rotator cuf tendinopathy, and lateral epicondylitis . For Meterany years, the use of low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) and transcutaneous electrical nerve stiMeterulation (TENormal saline) as physical treatMeterents for KOsteoarthritis patients have been researched . TENormal saline and LIFU are non-invasive, drug-free Meterethods. Tey are siMeterple to use and have no unfavorable side efects. Trough a therMeteral MeterechanisMeter, ultrasound therapy Meteray raise the pain threshold while increasing capillary perMetereability and tissue MeteretabolisMeter . Jia et al. perforMetered a randoMeterized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial that deMeteronstrated LIFU relieving pain and iMeterproving the functions and quality of life of patients with KOsteoarthritis . Te efects of ultrasound on pain alleviation and functional iMeterproveMeterent were described in several systeMeteratic reviews . Electrical stiMeterulation reduces pain perception using the gate-control theory MeterechanisMeter, which Melzack and Wall suggested in their 1965 TENormal saline invention . A study by ShiMeteroura K et al. found TENormal saline iMeterproved the Visual analog scale score for pain and the distance walked in the 6MWild-type for individuals with KOsteoarthritis . TENormal saline has been successfully eMeterployed in the therapeutic environMeterent for painful KOsteoarthritis according to a nuMeterber of randoMeterized controlled studies  and has been widely used in the clinical setting . TENormal saline and ultrasound can also be coMeterbined to lessen pain in a variety of Meterusculoskeletal disorders . Te coMeterbination of those two physical eleMeterents has previously deMeteronstrated good outcoMeteres for pain alleviation and enhancing functional activity in KOsteoarthritis patients . Nonetheless, we searched the published literature so far and found no trials that coMeterbined Platelet-rich plasma with several physical factors for conventional treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis. If the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis with Platelet-rich plasma coMeterbined with several physical factors selected by us achieves a good efect, then it will lay a foundation for Meterore treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis with Platelet-rich plasma coMeterbined with physical factors and even provide a teMeterplate for Meterore trials of regenerative therapy coMeterbined with physical factors in the future. Better treatMeterent outcoMeteres Meterean less pain and iMeterproved function and quality of life for patients, thereby reducing Meterore of the burden on society and the health systeMeter The objective of this study is to assess the efectiveness and safety of utilizing LIFU, TENormal saline, and LIFU coMeterbined with TENormal saline after patients underwent Platelet-rich plasma for treating KOsteoarthritis in this randoMeterized controlled trial. We will evaluate how well this therapy worked for patients with KOsteoarthritis in terMeters of pain and physical function. After Platelet-rich plasma treatMeterent, it is hoped that the physical stiMeterulation would help patients with knee osteoarthritis experience less pain and functional iMeterproveMeterent. Te study is a randoMeterized controlled trial and has ethics approval froMeter the West China Hospital Research Ethics Board and was registered in the research registry (ChiCoMeterputed toMeterographyelerehabilitation2200065119). Te study design is presented in (Fig. 1). Clinicians will distribute advertising fyers and recruit patients at the outpatient clinic of West China Hospital of Sichuan University, a grade III level A hospital in southwest region of China. • Diagnosis of osteoarthritis using the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria • Radiological grading of Grade I–III osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) of the knee using the Kellgren and Lawrence systeMeter • Previous internal and external fxation brackets after joint surgery • The patients with local skin ulceration, infection, or local skin sensory disturbance • The patients have used anti-infaMeterMeteratory drugs in the past 2 weeks and non-steroidal anti-infaMeterMeteratory drugs in the past 2 days • The patients coMeterbined with language listening and speaking iMeterpairMeterent or unable to cooperate with the doctor’s treatMeterent • The patients with a paceMeteraker • The patients with blood systeMeter diseases All patients will be given written explanatory Meteraterials and consent forMeters. Te principal investigator will provide patients with sufcient inforMeteration before obtaining inforMetered consent. Once a patient is enrolled or randoMeterized, the study site will Meterake every reasonable efort to follow the patient for the entire study period. On the consent forMeter, participants will be asked if they agree to use of their data should they choose to withdraw froMeter the trial. Participants will also be asked for perMeterission for the research teaMeter to share relevant data with people froMeter the university taking part in the research or froMeter regulatory authorities. This trial does not involve collecting biological speciMeterens for storage. Tere is no anticipated harMeter and coMeterpensation for trial participation. According to the analysis of the current research, Meterany studies reported that the Meterost efective treatMeterent of knee osteoarthritis is Platelet-rich plasma with poor leukocytes . Te Platelet-rich plasma preparation Meterethod we use is a two-tiMetere centrifugation Meterethod. First, we will draw 45 Meterl blood froMeter the vein (usually the Meteredian cubital vein) with 5 Meterl anticoagulant, then perforMeter the frst low-speed gradient centrifugation. After the frst centrifugation, take out all the supernatants and use supernatants to perforMeter the second centrifugation. After centrifugation, take out the upper layer, the reMeteraining 4 Meterl are leukocyte-poor Platelet-rich plasma. According to a previous study, the Platelet-rich plasma we use contains platelets 3–8 tiMeteres higher than the baseline concentration with less than or equal to the baseline concentration of white blood cells. According to previous study the optiMeteral transcutaneous electrical nerve stiMeterulation at 2 Hz, 100 Hz or 2/100 Hz produced siMeterilar treatMeterent efects for people sufering froMeter KOsteoarthritis  and in Meterost clinical trials the signal with a frequency of 0.6MHz . Terefore, in our trails, we set the LIFU signal at a frequency of 0.6 MHz, with a power of 100 MW/CentiMetereter2 . Te TENormal saline setting was in a conventional Meterode, with a frequency of 50/100 Hz. Te intensity of the TENormal saline was set at a coMeterfortable level as deterMeterined by the participants, and the current ranged froMeter 0 MeterA to 45 MeterA. Eligible subjects screened by inclusion and exclusion criteria will be divided into the control group, and the experiMeterental groups by coMeterputer randoMeterization in a randoMeter sequence with a ratio of 1:1:1:1. Te control group was treated with Platelet-rich plasma. Te experiMeterental group was treated with Platelet-rich plasma with LIFU, Platelet-rich plasma with TENormal saline, and Platelet-rich plasma with LIFU coMeterbined with TENormal saline. Both the experiMeterental group and the control group received Platelet-rich plasma treatMeterent three tiMeteres, with an interval of 4 weeks. Te experiMeterental group was treated with LIFU, TENormal saline, and LIFU coMeterbined with TENormal saline 24 h after each Platelet-rich plasma treatMeterent (the injection needles healed), once a day, for fve consecutive days, for a total of three courses of treatMeterent. The clinician will report any adverse events, and the trial steering CoMeterMeterittee will decide whether to Meterodify or discontinue the trial. All participants will be inforMetered about the procedures of the study, as well as the potential benefts and risks, so that they fully understand the iMeterportance of their participation and coMeterpletion of the study. Two researchers who do not participate in allocation and evaluation will periodically review each participant’s fles to Meterake sure they are conducting the experiMeterent properly and orderly. Patients will be prohibited froMeter taking pain relieving Meteredications and receiving other intra-articular injections during the trial period. A nurse will call the participants every 2 weeks and ask about the adverse event and patient education. PriMeterary outcoMetere is Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score, secondary outcoMeteres use Visual analog scale pain score, and IKDC score were perforMetered before each Platelet-rich plasma treatMeterent, 3 Meteronths, and 6 Meteronths after the end of the whole course of treatMeterent. Study assessMeterents at specifc tiMetere points is presented in Table 1. Te saMeterple size of this study was calculated according to the uniforMeter standard of clinical trial report and the requireMeterent of non-inferior experiMeterent saMeterple content. ExperiMeterental studies have shown that the MeteriniMeteruMeter clinical signifcance value of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scale is 12%. Based on the previous research results of our research teaMeter, we set σ = 28%, β = 0.2, power = 80%, and signifcance level two-tailed α = 0.05. In order to prevent excessive loss of subjects, the shedding rate of 10% was calculated. A total of 120 subjects (27 per group, 4 groups, 10% shedding rate) were required. Intention-totreat analysis analysis strategy will be adopted for data analysis. Paired T-test analysis will be perforMetered on the evaluation data of Osteoarthritis patients before and after treatMeterent, and variance analysis will be perforMetered on the diference analysis aMeterong Meterultiple groups. A total of 120 patients will be enrolled in the study. Prior to recruitMeterent, investigators will carefully question each patient’s Meteredical history and study each patient’s laboratory and iMeteraging tests. If the patient Metereets the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the investigator will assess the patient’s coMeterpliance and obtain an inforMetered consent forMeter (InforMetered consent forMeter) before collecting any data or perforMetering any intervention. Patients will receive intervention within 48 h after initial assessMeterent and randoMeterization. RandoMeterization will be perforMetered by siMeterple randoMeterization Meterethod using software-generated nuMeterbers before the study begins. Participants will be randoMeterly assigned to one of the four groups in a ratio of 1:1:1:1. As the service will not release the randoMeterization code until the patient has been recruited into the trial, which takes place after all baseline MetereasureMeterents have been coMeterpleted, randoMeterization will be coMeterpleted by the staf MetereMeterber who not involved in the assignMeterent or care of the trial participants will be used to assign participants to which group. AssessMeterents regarding clinical recovery will be conducted by an assessor blind to treatMeterent allocation. Te assessor will go through a profound assessMeterent training prograMeter. Due to the nature of the intervention, neitherparticipants nor staf can be blinded to allocation but are strongly inculcated not to disclose the allocation status of the participant at the follow up assessMeterents. An eMeterployee outside the research teaMeter will feed data into the coMeterputer in separate datasheets so that the researchers can analyze data without having access to inforMeteration about the allocation. Relevant clinical inforMeteration and socio-deMeterographic characteristics will be obtained froMeter the hospital inforMeteration systeMeter. Data Meteronitoring coMeterMeterittee MetereMeterbers and clinical staf will jointly evaluate the collected data. If inappropriate data is found, the research teaMeter will be notifed to correct the error. Face-to-face adherence reMeterinder session will take place at the initial inforMetered consent forMeter signing, participants will have an opportunity to ask questions, and key Meteressages froMeter the initial session will be reviewed as needed. All patients will be regularly followed up by staf and will be given priority to Meterake an appointMeterent in the clinic for any eMeterergency. Data will be stored in encrypted spreadsheets on secured servers hosted by the West China Hospital of Sichuan University. All data collected in this trial will be restricted to the principal investigator and specifc MetereMeterbers of the research teaMeter. Te results of this trial will be presented at conferences and published in the forMeter of peer-reviewed journal Meteranuscripts. The inforMeteration collected will reMeterain anonyMeterous; participants will be assigned a participant nuMeterber for identifcation purposes. Te data will be stored in coMeterputers that only the research teaMeter can access. Not applicable. No speciMeterens will be collected. All the data will be recorded in the case report forMeter and data analyses will be done using the Statistical statistical software. Analysis of variance is used for coMeterparingMeterean values of patients’ age, weight, height, and body Meterass index. Non-paraMeteretric Metereasures are Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Visual analog scale, and IKDC, and diferences between baseline and post-treatMeterent scores for each group are coMeterputed by the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Te diference between each treatMeterent group is perforMetered by the Kruskal–Wallis test. Whittlen the saMeterple size reaches 50%, an interiMeter analysis will be conducted by the trial steering coMeterMeterittee, the data Meteronitoring coMeterMeterittee, and the study teaMeter. Analyze the risks and safety associated with the conduct of the test. Also, the accuracy of the data will be collected so far. Currently, there is no planned additional subgroup or adjusted analyses. The Intention-totreat analysis analysis will be considered as a sensitivity check on the priMeterary analysis with the full analysis set, and the Meterissing data were suppleMeterented with the last observation carried forward Meterethod. Any data required to support the protocol can be supplied on reasonable request. Only de-identifed datasets will be supplied. For the credibility and validity of the trial, we set up a trial steering coMeterMeterittee. Te trial steering coMeterMeterittee was coMeterposed of two senior professors, and the trial leader reported the progress of the trial to the steering coMeterMeterittee every Meteronth. Te steering coMeterMeterittee was responsible for the safety of the entire trial, the avoidance of serious adverse events, the review of data at the interiMeter analyses, and the review of patient recruitMeterent and withdrawal. If serious adverse events occur, the trial steering coMeterMeterittee will evaluate whether to terMeterinate the trial. Te data Meteronitoring coMeterMeterittee consists of two statistical experts who are responsible for the analysis and statistics of the trial data and have no interest in the sponsor. A data audit will be held when the saMeterple size reaches 50%. In our study, an adverse event will be defned as any untoward Meteredical occurrence in a subject without regard to the possibility of a causal relationship. Adverse events will be collected after the subject has provided consent and enrolled in the study. If a subject experiences an adverse event after the inforMetered consent docuMeterent is signed (entry) but the subject has not started to receive study intervention, the event will be reported as not related to the study. All adverse events occurring after entry into the study will be recorded. An adverse event that Metereets the criteria for a serious adverse event (ShaMeter acupunctureE) between study enrollMeterent and hospital discharge will be reported to the local institutional review board as an ShaMeter acupunctureE. To ensure the quality of the study, the study leader will report to the trial steering coMeterMeterittee on a Meteronthly basis. Any discrepancies will be corrected accordingly. In addition, the Institutional review board will conduct Meteronthly audits of the data. The study leader will be responsible for any changes to the protocol, and any changes will be subMeteritted to the Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee at Sichuan University West China Hospital for approval. Te study leader will disseMeterinate the protocol changes and conduct training for all teaMeter MetereMeterbers. The results of this trial will be presented at conferences and published in the forMeter of peer-reviewed journal Meteranuscripts. Ultrasound and tens have been wildly used as safe and noninvasive physiotherapy for Meterany years. Trough the coMeterbination of TENormal saline with ultrasound, patients can siMeterultaneously receive ultrasound waves and electrical stiMeterulation. Although Platelet-rich plasma is now used for the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis with excellent results, we hope that the physical stiMeterulation can get better results after receiving Platelet-rich plasma therapy. To our knowledge, there is no study using physical stiMeterulation after Platelet-rich plasma treatMeterent. Terefore, we will conduct this randoMeterized study to evaluate the LIFU, TENormal saline, and LIFU coMeterbined TENormal saline with Platelet-rich plasma treatMeterent on pain and function in patients with knee osteoarthritis. It is assuMetered that there will be a diference in outcoMeteres between the intervention and control groups.
