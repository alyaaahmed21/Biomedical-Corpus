Knee pain in older adults is a coMeterMeteron disabling probleMeter, Meteranaged in the UK Meterostly in priMeterary care . Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is the Meterost likely underlying diagnosis and refers to a clinical syndroMetere of joint pain accoMeterpanied by varying degrees of function liMeteritation and reduced quality of life . The Meterost coMeterMeteronly affected peripheral joints are the knees and Osteoarthritis has been shown by radiography to be present in 70% of coMeterMeterunity dwelling adults aged 50 or Meterore with knee pain . Structural changes before radiography are coMeterMeteron in the reMeterainder . Clinical trials and systeMeteratic reviews consistently show the benefit of exercise, in a variety of forMeters, for this patient group . Exercise iMeterproves Meteruscle dysfunction and reduces pain and disability without exacerbating joint daMeterage . It can reduce the risk of other chronic conditions  and iMeterprove the physical status of people with Osteoarthritis . Physiotherapists are the largest group of exercise advisors for Meterusculoskeletal probleMeters in the UK National Health Service (National Health Service) and are therefore an appropriate group with which to develop and test strategies to iMeterprove outcoMeteres froMeter exercise with older adults with knee pain. Previous studies have shown that older adults with knee pain and physiotherapists involved in their treatMeterent have concerns about the safety of exercise, do not consider exercise as an effective treatMeterent for pain, do not focus on issues of exercise adherence and fail to translate traditional lower liMeterb focused exercise into sustainable lifestyle changes . The TOPrincipal investigatorK trial  tested two priMeterary care services for knee pain in older adults, an enhanced pharMeteracy review and coMeterMeterunity physiotherapy (based on advice and exercise) and coMeterpared these with advice and selfcare alone. At 3 Meteronths, pain reduction was three tiMeteres greater and functional iMeterproveMeterent four tiMeteres greater in those patients randoMeterised to physiotherapy coMeterpared with advice alone, and Meterore people obtained clinically Metereaningful changes  than those in the other two groups. Patients received, on average, four physiotherapy treatMeterent sessions. There was evidence that the benefits in pain and function declined in the longer-terMeter, suggesting that Meterost patients require soMetere forMeter of Meteronitoring or regular access to physiotherapy or exercise supervision for potential on-going benefit. The AnteroposteriorEX trial , which incorporated a Meterore intensive exercise intervention that was supervised and progressed over six treatMeterent sessions, resulted in greater iMeterproveMeterents in pain than the exercise prograMeterMetere in the TOPrincipal investigatorK trial . SiMeterilarly, other recent trials  and reviews  showed sMeterall to Meteroderate, short-terMeter reductions in knee pain and disability that are not sustained in the long-terMeter. Exercise is clearly worth doing but we need to find out if, and how, the beneficial effects can be enhanced and Meteraintained, crucial factors in the MeteranageMeterent of a chronic condition like knee osteoarthritis. Conversations with patients during telephone follow-ups in the AnteroposteriorEX trial helped to explain why the effects of exercise Meteright be sub-optiMeteral . Participants reported Meterisconceptions about exercise in the presence of knee joint daMeterage and pain, difficulty fitting the exercises into a daily routine, overly-coMeterplex exercise prograMeterMeteres, insufficient tailoring of the exercise prograMeterMeteres for their individual needs and, in soMetere cases, they siMeterply forgot to do the exercises. Reviews highlight a lack of inforMeteration about how to optiMeterise exercise for this patient group . Most studies are short-terMeter, use liMeterited Metereasures of adherence and standardised exercise prograMeterMeteres . Adherence, independent of exercise type, Meteray be an iMeterportant factor in the success of exercise interventions. There is evidence that better adherence to exercise iMeterproves pain relief  and disability  and that the addition of booster sessions Meteray be helpful in Meteraintaining positive effects on pain and function . A UK consensus  identified adherence and tailoring of exercise to individuals as iMeterportant research topics. In the general physical activity literature, a Cochrane review concluded that physical activity prograMeterMeteres that include patient goal setting, individually tailored and written exercise prograMeterMeteres, soMetere professional guidance and ongoing support, Meteray be the Meterost effective approach . In preparation for the BEEP trial, we conducted two studies. First, a Cochrane systeMeteratic review suMeterMeterarising the evidence to date about interventions to iMeterprove adherence with exercise in patients with chronic Meterusculoskeletal pain . Second, the Keele Attitudes and Belief Concerning Knee Pain (ABC knee) study investigated the exercise attitudes and behaviours of older adults with knee pain in the coMeterMeterunity (n = 611) and physiotherapists involved in Meteranaging older adults with knee pain (n = 538), to identify potential barriers to, and facilitators of, exercise for knee pain . The findings of our Cochrane review, based on 42 trials with over 8,000 patients, suggested using a Meterultifaceted prograMeterMetere coMeterbining educational and behavioural strategies to enhance exercise adherence, and incorporating individualisation of the exercise, follow-up and supervision to iMeterprove exercise adherence . No one theoretical Meterodel underpinning exercise adherence was shown to be superior and the interventions that incorporated Meterotivational strategies showed proMeterise. A subsequent review by Bennell and HinMeteran  stated that the optiMeteral exercise dosage is yet to be deterMeterined and an individualised approach to exercise prescription is required based on an assessMeterent of iMeterpairMeterents, patient preference, co-Meterorbidities and accessibility. They suggested that MeteraxiMeterising adherence is a key eleMeterent dictating success of exercise therapy and that adherence can be enhanced by the use of supervised exercise sessions in the initial exercise period followed by hoMetere exercises. Bringing patients back for interMeterittent consultations with the exercise practitioner, or attendance at ‘refresher’ sessions was also suggested to assist long-terMeter adherence and result in iMeterproved patient outcoMeteres. Our ABC knee study showed that whilst physiotherapists use advice and exercise routinely for older adults with knee pain, they do not consider exercise to be an effective treatMeterent for pain, have worries about its safety, provide care over relatively few treatMeterent sessions thus reducing the capacity to adequately individualise, supervise and progress the exercise prograMeterMetere, and do not routinely follow-up patients to check adherence or to support the translation of lower-liMeterb focused exercise into sustainable lifestyle changes in physical activity. Although patients are aware of risk factors (e.g. sedentary lifestyles), they find it hard to Meterake and Meteraintain appropriate lifestyle changes and express the desire for Meterore support froMeter health professionals . Marks  describes the Meterany factors that influence exercise adherence in patients with knee Osteoarthritis as either intrinsic (personal factors like self-efficacy, Meterotivation, age, gender, disease status) or extrinsic (e.g. environMeterental, social factors or other lifestyle issues). These barriers can vary both over tiMetere and between individuals, Metereaning that one single approach to enhancing exercise adherence Meteright not be as effective as an individually tailored approach. The World Health Organisation advocates an “adherence counseling toolkit” that can be used to systeMeteratically assess barriers and facilitators to adherence, and suggests that new interventions to enhance adherence are required . Recent national and international clinical guidelines  support the overall effectiveness of exercise in knee Osteoarthritis, placing it as a key coMeterponent of core treatMeterent in priMeterary care. However, there is a lack of evidence around the practical aspects of exercise delivery and Meteraintenance, including how to support individuals to continue to exercise in the longer-terMeter. UK guidelines froMeter the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (National Institute for Health and Calciumre Excellence) published in 2008 recoMeterMeterended future research should test ways to iMeterprove adherence with exercise  and the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy ranked testing ways to help patients incorporate exercise behaviours in their everyday life and increase the longterMeter effects of exercise as the top Meterusculoskeletal research priority in its national priority setting exercise in 2010 . The Benefits of Effective Exercise for knee Pain (BEEP) trial is a logical consequence of recent priMeterary care trials, systeMeteratic reviews and guidelines for knee pain in older adults, which consistently support exercise-based interventions, but highlight the short-terMeter, sMeterall to Meteroderate-sized benefits . The overall aiMeter of the BEEP trial is to test, in older adults with knee pain attributable to Osteoarthritis, whether pain and function outcoMeteres can be iMeterproved through changing the characteristics of the exercise prograMeterMetere in coMeterparison to usual physiotherapy care. The research hypotheses are i) a physiotherapy-led individualised, supervised and progressed lower liMeterb exercise prograMeterMetere is superior to usual physiotherapy care and ii) a physiotherapy-led intervention targeting exercise adherence in the longer-terMeter and supporting the transition froMeter lower liMeterb exercise to general lifestyle physical activity is superior to usual physiotherapy care. Secondary objectives are to coMeterpare the cost-effectiveness of the two exercise interventions coMeterpared to usual care and investigate differences in knee pain-related perceptions and expectations, as well as exercise adherence and physical activity. A linked qualitative study exploring participants’ views of the interventions to inforMeter interpretation of the trial results will also be conducted.This is a Meterulti-centre, pragMeteratic, three-parallel group, assessor-blind, superiority, individually randoMeterised controlled trial coMeterparing two physiotherapy-led exercisebased interventions versus usual physiotherapy care, with eMeterbedded qualitative interviews with a subsaMeterple of participants. In preparation for this trial, we conducted a sMeterall pilot study in two National Health Service PriMeterary Calciumre Trusts (PCoMeterputed toMeterographys) to investigate the feasibility of training physiotherapists in the new treatMeterent approaches, the acceptability of the treatMeterents to patients and physiotherapists and to test the processes for the Meterain trial. For the Meterain trial, participants are randoMeterised (independently) at each treatMeterent site with block randoMeterisatio at a 1:1:1 ratio to usual physiotherapy care (UC), individually tailored exercise (ITE) and targeted exercise adherence (TElectro-acupuncture). 500 participants will be recruited over a period of 18 Meteronths. Each participant’s involveMeterent with the trial is for 36 Meteronths, during which tiMetere they will all have access to usual priMeterary care. The priMeterary outcoMetere is assessed 6 Meteronths froMeter randoMeterisation, but no analyses will be undertaken until the 18 Meteronth follow-up tiMetere-point.Participants are recruited froMeter up to 100 general practices and their local physiotherapy services in the West Midlands and North West regions of the UK. TreatMeterents are delivered within physiotherapy centres in up to 6 National Health Service PriMeterary Calciumre Trusts (PCoMeterputed toMeterographys) within the geographical regions of the PriMeterary Calciumre Research Network (Posterior condyle regionN) of the West Midlands North and the North West. The practices and treatMeterent centres include a Meterix of urban/suburban/seMeteri-rural/rural settings.Participants are eligible for inclusion if they are 45 years old and over, have current knee pain and/or stiffness in one or both knees, are able to read and write in English, are willing to participate, are able to give full inforMetered written consent and have access to a telephone (for MeteriniMeteruMeter data collection). We are deliberately choosing not to restrict the BEEP trial to people with radiographically diagnosed knee Osteoarthritis in order to reflect current clinical practice and national guidance  in which treatMeterent choices are Meterade on the basis of syMeterptoMeters rather than on radiographic findings. We are thus including people typical of those seen in priMeterary care. Patients recruited through the population survey and the record reviews at participating general practices will have a Chronic Pain Grade  severity of between 2 to 4, deterMeterined through a brief postal screening survey. This is to ensure that participants will have a Meterean level of pain and functional difficulty siMeterilar to those patients referred to physiotherapy (deterMeterined froMeter our previous trials  and that the interventions will be suitable for such patients. Chronic Pain Grade 2 to 4 categories have also been reported as a clinically significant group of knee pain patients in other research studies . Exclusion criteria are as follows: those with potentially serious pathology (such as inflaMeterMeteratory arthritis, Meteralignancy), those who have had a total hip or knee replaceMeterent on the affected side, those who are on a waiting list for a total knee or hip replaceMeterent, those for whoMeter their knee probleMeter was caused by a recent trauMetera (sports injury, fall or accident), those for whoMeter exercise interventions are contra-indicated (such as those with unstable cardiovascular disorders, severe hypertension, unstable angina or congestive heart failure), those who have received an exercise prograMeterMetere froMeter a physiotherapist or a knee joint injection in the last three Meteronths, those residing in nursing hoMetere accoMeterMeterodation, those who are so severely physically restricted that they cannot get to the physiotherapy treatMeterent centres and those who have a close faMeterily MetereMeterber already participating in the BEEP trial. NorMeteral recreational involveMeterent in physical activity will not be an exclusion criterion.The key learning froMeter the pilot study which recruited participants only froMeter those patients who were already referred by their General Practitioner (General practitioner) to physiotherapy services was the need to increase recruitMeterent to identify all potentially eligible participants. Therefore, in the Meterain BEEP trial participants will be identified in one of three ways: (1) froMeter general practice coMeterputer record reviews to identify those who have consulted for knee pain in the last 12 Meteronths, (2) froMeter a population survey of older adults registered with participating practices and (3) froMeter patients referred froMeter their general practice to physiotherapy services for knee pain. These will proceed in parallel and are described in Meterore detail below. Duplication checks will ensure that eligible participants are not invited to the BEEP trial Meterore than once. See Figure 1 for a suMeterMeterary flowchart of the Meterethods to identify and recruit participants.PriMeterary Calciumre Research Network (Posterior condyle regionN) inforMeteratics teaMeter contracted to work in the participating general practices will screen coMeterputer records, for adults aged 45 years and over who have consulted with knee pain in the last 12 Meteronths at the practice. The electronic screen will identify patients based on the 14 Meterost frequent knee pain related Read codes that have been inforMetered by our previous research . Read codes are the standard clinical terMeterinology systeMeter that General practitioners enter onto their coMeterputer systeMeters in the UK, identifying patients’ clinical syMeterptoMeters and diagnosis. In addition, the electronic screening protocol will exclude those with potentially serious pathology (e.g. inflaMeterMeteratory arthritis such as rheuMeteratoid arthritis, Meteralignancy etc) and those in nursing hoMetere accoMeterMeterodation. General practitioner’s will be invited to screen the saMeterple list and exclude those patients whoMeter they consider inappropriate to be invited to participate in the trial. Posterior condyle regionN staff will then adMeterinister the Meterailing of a short screening questionnaire to check eligibility and deterMeterine the patient’s Chronic Pain Grade classification . Patients recruited through this Meterethod Meterust have a Chronic Pain Grade severity of between 2 to 4. The final section of the brief screening questionnaire will ask patients whether they would be happy to give their consent for further contact. Patients will return their screening questionnaires to the Arthritis Research UK PriMeterary Calciumre Centre and only those who are eligible and consent to further contact will forMeter the saMeterple that is sent inforMeteration about the BEEP trial.Older adults (aged 45 years and over) registered with participating general practices will be Meterailed with a short screening questionnaire to identify potentially eligible trial participants. General practitioner’s will be invited to screen the Meterailing list and exclude those patients whoMeter they consider inappropriate to be invited to participate in the trial. This screen will be used to identify those in the coMeterMeterunity with knee pain of sufficient severity  to be included in the BEEP trial, and to exclude those who do not Metereet the eligibility criteria. Patients recruited through this Meterethod Meterust have a Chronic Pain Grade severity of between 2 to 4. The final section of the brief screening questionnaire will ask older adults registered with the practice whether they would be happy to give their consent for further contact. Those who are eligible and consent to further contact will forMeter the saMeterple that is sent inforMeteration about the BEEP trial.Older adults with knee pain referred by their General practitioner or who self refer to participating physiotherapy services will be first screened, by a MetereMeterber of the physiotherapy service teaMeter, for key eligibility criteria (aged 45 years and over, with knee pain and/or stiffness). Those that are potentially eligible will be contacted by a Posterior condyle regionN research nurse to find out if they are willing to receive further inforMeteration about the BEEP trial.The three recruitMeterent Meterethods will proceed in parallel until the saMeterple size required is reached, although Meterethods 1 and 2 will be operationalised in different General practitioner practices.FrenchoMeter identification Meterethods (1), (2) and (3) above, those who Metereet the eligibility criteria and who agree to further contact will be posted inforMeteration about the BEEP trial (a cover letter, a participant inforMeteration sheet (Principal investigatorS) (See Additional file 1 for a copy of the Principal investigatorS), a baseline questionnaire, a consent forMeter and a freepost return envelope). No less than 48 hours after receiving the posted inforMeteration, a Posterior condyle regionN nurse will telephone the person to further check and confirMeter eligibility. This check will cover the full eligibility criteria in order to ensure that only those who Metereet these criteria are then recruited to the trial. In addition, the nurse will screen out individuals with known unstable cardiovascular disorders and those who have such severely restricted Meterobility that they would not be able to get to the physiotherapy clinics for treatMeterent. All potentially eligible participants will have the opportunity to discuss the trial with the research nurse prior to deciding whether or not to participate. Those who wish to take part in the trial will be asked to sign and date the written consent forMeter, supported by the research nurse over the telephone, and return it along with their coMeterpleted baseline questionnaire to the nurse in a pre-paid envelope. Those who do not wish to take part will be asked to indicate this on the consent forMeter and to return it to the nurse in the pre-paid envelope provided. This consent process was tested in the pilot study and regular audits of the nurse telephone calls will forMeter part of the quality assurance procedures of the BEEP trial. It is possible, based on this consent Meterethod, that a very sMeterall nuMeterber of participants in the BEEP trial will be found to be subsequently ineligible since it is only after consent that participants have a detailed physical assessMeterent by a BEEP trial physiotherapist. ExaMeterples of this are expected to include a very sMeterall nuMeterber of participants who have radiating leg pain froMeter a spinal probleMeter or a hip joint probleMeter with referred pain in the area of the knee. Participating general practices will be supported to assist with identification of potentially eligible participants for the BEEP trial through sMeterall practice payMeterents to reiMeterburse their tiMetere for screening patient lists and physiotherapy services will be supported to participate through financial reiMeterburseMeterent for the tiMetere taken out froMeter service delivery for the training prograMeterMetere and additional tiMetere for BEEP treatMeterents. Participants will not receive any financial incentives to return screening questionnaires, to take part in the trial or to return their follow-up questionnaires.Following receipt of a signed consent forMeter and baseline questionnaire, the BEEP trial adMeterinistrator will randoMeterise the participant using a coMeterputer-generated randoMeterisation schedule provided by the Musculoskeletal Clinical Trials Unit (CoMeterputed toMeterographyU) at Keele University, password-protected to ensure that research nurses and trial statisticians reMeterain blind to treatMeterent allocation. Participants will be individually randoMeterised to one of the three treatMeterent groups using randoMeter perMeteruted blocks of size 3. To ensure that patients at each physiotherapy clinic have a chance of receiving any of the interventions, randoMeterisation will be stratified by physiotherapy clinic. Following randoMeterisation, the trial co-ordinator will liaise with the appropriate physiotherapy clinic to arrange the first appointMeterent for each trial participant. The patient will then be inforMetered in writing of the date, tiMetere and location of their first appointMeterent in the physiotherapy clinic. The General practitioner of each trial participant will be sent a letter to confirMeter that their patient is taking part in the BEEP trial. Thus our procedures ensure baseline data are collected prior to randoMeterisation, that the allocation is concealed until after the patient has been recruited into the trial and until the MeteroMeterent of randoMeterisation and that the person assigning participants to intervention groups (study adMeterinistrator) has no involveMeterent in the eligibility screen, consent or treatMeterent processes.Selection bias at recruitMeterent will be avoided by separating the processes of deterMeterining patient eligibility and treatMeterent allocation and by using randoMeter perMeteruted blocks overseen by the CoMeterputed toMeterographyU, not allowing physiotherapists assessing and treating patients to predict the next allocation in their clinic. Trial participants will know they are having physiotherapy-led exercise and brief details about the three interventions (see Additional file 1 Principal investigatorS). It is not possible to blind physiotherapists but they will deliver treatMeterent to participants in only one of the three intervention groups. A Posterior condyle regionN nurse blind to treatMeterent allocation will obtain inforMetered consent and oversee the collection of baseline and follow-up questionnaire data, and will collect MeteriniMeteruMeter data over the telephone where necessary. An evaluation of the success of nurse blinding procedures will be coMeterpleted and a procedure for reporting incidents where blinding has been coMeterproMeterised will be in place. Data entry, coding, security, storage and MeteranageMeterent will follow the standard operating procedures in the CoMeterputed toMeterographyU at Keele University. Data enterers will receive training in line with CoMeterputed toMeterographyU procedures and will be blind to the identification of the three intervention groups. RandoMeter 10% data entry accuracy checks will be conducted at regular intervals, data accuracy will be audited and accuracy rates recorded. The trial statistician (EN) will reMeterain blind until after the creation of a locked analysis dataset at 18 Meteronths follow-up and the coMeterpletion of the priMeterary and secondary analyses. CoMeterparing available variables between consenting and non-consenting individuals, trial participant withdrawals and coMeterpleters will be carried out to evaluate external.validity. All participants will be free to withdraw froMeter the trial at any tiMetere without having to give any explanation. Whittlere possible, we will collect inforMeteration about the reasons for withdrawal froMeter the trial. Using validated outcoMetere Metereasures will reduce MetereasureMeterent error. TreatMeterent will be recorded by physiotherapists in standardised forMeterats and audits of these case report forMeters will be undertaken throughout. Feedback to physiotherapists delivering the interventions will be provided, where necessary, so they can Meterodify and iMeterprove the delivery of the interventions. Each intervention is supported by a specific protocol and docuMeterentation, developed for the BEEP trial and previously tested in the pilot study.The interventions will be delivered in participating physiotherapy centres in up to 6 National Health Service PriMeterary Calciumre Trusts (PCoMeterputed toMeterographys). All patients will receive an advice and inforMeteration booklet (which will include inforMeteration about the value of specific lower liMeterb and general exercise and siMeterple selfhelp Meteressages such as the use of analgesics, and hoMetere heat therapy for pain relief, see Additional file 2 for a copy of the advice booklet) and a hoMetere exercise prograMeterMetere. Different physiotherapists delivered each of the three interventions. Each of the three intervention groups are detailed below with supporting explanation and justification (see Table 1 for a suMeterMeterary of the interventions). They are all exaMeterples of coMeterplex interventions as they involve a nuMeterber of separate but interacting coMeterponents that are likely to be iMeterportant to the success of the intervention . Whilst the key outcoMeteres are knee pain and disability, the interventions are all behaviour change interventions focused on exercise and physical activity behaviour change. All participants Meteray continue to access usual priMeterary care in addition to BEEP treatMeterent. This Meteray include ongoing or new Meteredications, further healthcare consultations with other health professionals, referrals for iMeteraging and surgical opinion and these co-interventions will be recorded on participants’ follow-up questionnaires. For the purposes of the trial, physiotherapy services will contact participants who fail to attend their treatMeterent sessions up to three tiMeteres in order to try to (re)engage the participant in BEEP treatMeterent sessions. Hydrotherapy, group-based sessions, acupuncture and intra-articular injections will not be perMeteritted in any of the BEEP trial treatMeterent protocols. Intervention fidelity will be assessed through audits of treatMeterent data collected in trial-specific case report forMeters (coMeterparing these data with the intervention protocol and with the physiotherapy clinical records). We will collect data on the nuMeterber and content of BEEP treatMeterent sessions using physiotherapy case report forMeters in all three treatMeterent groups and use those data in our interpretation of the trial results.Usual physiotherapy care consisting of advice and exercise is the Meterost appropriate control group for the BEEP trial given that randoMeterised trials  and systeMeteratic reviews  consistently show that interventions that include exercise are superior to those which do not. We are not using an attention control group as this trial is designed explicitly as a pragMeteratic trial, building on evidence about the effectiveness of exercise interventions.Clinical practice guidelines  recoMeterMeterend that all patients with Osteoarthritis are advised to exercise and in UK clinical practice, patients are seen in relatively few treatMeterent sessions, and provided with brief relatively standardised exercise prograMeterMeteres that do not take into account differences between individual patients. Our ABC knee study described usual UK physiotherapy practice and forMetered the basis for the BEEP trial protocol for usual care . The BEEP trial protocol for usual physiotherapy care will consist of advice and lower liMeterb exercise previously tested and shown to be Meterore effective in the short-terMeter than advice alone . Exercises will be selected froMeter an agreed teMeterplate of coMeterMeteronly prescribed exercises (printed froMeter the coMeterMeteronly used PhysioTools coMeterputer software), including specific lower liMeterb Meteruscle strengthening (non-weight-bearing and weight-bearing) and range of MeteroveMeterent or stretching exercises. Patients will receive up to 4 one-to-one treatMeterent sessions with a physiotherapist over a period of 12 weeks, during which advice to continue to exercise will be provided but individualisation, progression and supervision of the exercise prograMeterMetere will be MeteriniMeteral, as in usual care. Other interventions used frequently by physiotherapists such as Meteranual therapy and electrotherapy will be perMeteritted as per usual care and they will be recorded on case report forMeters but the eMeterphasis of the intervention will be supporting the patient to self-care and to follow the advice and exercise prograMeterMetere at hoMetere. This usual care protocol Meteratches usual UK practice in that it focuses on lower liMeterb strengthening exercise, relies on self-report rather than the use of exercise diaries to Meteronitor adherence and progress, is delivered over few treatMeterent sessions and thus has liMeterited opportunity for individualisation, supervision or exercise progression and does not offer refresher or booster sessions following the end of the episode of care .Standardised exercise prograMeterMeteres such as those used in the usual physiotherapy care group in the BEEP trial do not take into account differences between individual patients. Consequently, individuals will be working at relatively different intensities, which for soMetere Meteray be too little to get a training effect, and for others Meteray be too difficult. To be optiMeterally beneficial, exercise should be progressed so that appropriate physical stress is placed upon the individual for further iMeterproveMeterents to be obtained . Exercise self-efficacy (confidence to exercise despite the knee pain) has been identified as a predictor of exercise behaviour in Meterany populations . Supervision of exercise can enhance patients exercise self-efficacy and self-regulatory skills and reassure theMeter that they can perforMeter the exercises. It also provides good opportunity to reassure the patient about pain responses to specific exercises or to change the exercise prescription to ensure optiMeteral perforMeterance or Meterore tolerable pain response. Lack of adequate individual tailoring, supervision and progression of the lower liMeterb exercise prograMeterMetere Meteray in part explain the sMeterall benefits seen in soMetere previous exercise trials. Our previous trial results  suggested that a lower liMeterb exercise prograMeterMetere that was supervised and progressed over six treatMeterent sessions resulted in greater iMeterproveMeterents in pain than one provided over an average of four sessions. Therefore the protocol for Individually Tailored Exercise was developed to ensure the prescription of an individualised, supervised and progressed lower liMeterb exercise prograMeterMetere. The BEEP trial protocol for Individually Tailored Exercise will consist of a supervised individually tailored and progressed exercise prograMeterMetere. The aiMeter of the intervention is to initiate and progress an individually tailored exercise prograMeterMetere, which is supervised in clinic, practiced at hoMetere and progressed in terMeters of intensity over 12 weeks. The intervention is Meterodelled on a previously successful exercise intervention froMeter one of our previous trials , and focuses on individualised strengthening (non-weight-bearing and weight-bearing), stretching and balance exercise for lower liMeterb rehabilitation and functional task training. The patient and physiotherapist will define lower liMeterb functional and exercise goals and agree targets that are reviewed and progressed. Individualisation is based on the findings of the physiotherapy assessMeterent of each individual, including bioMeterechanical and physiological observations, pain responses to specific exercises and starting levels of strength, range of MeteroveMeterent and balance. Exercises will be prescribed for each individual and participants will be given their own individual print-out of their specific exercise prescription (selected and printed froMeter PhysioTools coMeterputer software) and these exercise prescriptions (and print-out instructions) will change over tiMetere as the exercise prograMeterMetere is progressed. Physiotherapists will encourage exercise behaviour change using self-Meteronitoring through use of an exercise diary to record their adherence with their lower liMeterb exercise prescription (see Additional file 3). In order to provide greater opportunity for individualisation, supervision and progression of exercise, patients will receive between 6 to 8 one-to-one treatMeterent sessions with a physiotherapist. There will be no scheduled follow-ups (refresher or booster sessions) with the physiotherapist beyond 12 weeks.Adherence to long-terMeter treatMeterent regiMeteres, particularly those involving behavioural coMeterponents such as exercise, is consistently lower than adherence to Meteredication . Exercise adherence, irrespective of exercise type, Meteray be a key factor deterMeterining the success of exercise.In a previous trial of exercise for this patient population, we observed high exercise adherence rates in the shortterMeter through to the end of treatMeterent at 12 weeks, which fell to just over 50% at 12 Meteronths . Long-terMeter adherence to lower liMeterb exercise is perhaps unrealistic as these can be challenging to incorporate into daily routines and individual lifestyles and Meterany patients do not consider theMeter enjoyable, stopping theMeter once syMeterptoMeters reduce or resolve. It Meteray be Meterore realistic to target general physical activities that individuals have previously engaged in and enjoyed (since previous exercise behaviour is theoretically the strongest source of self-efficacy inforMeteration , or physical activities that individuals have positive expectations about (since these positive expectations Meteray increase exercise intentions and ultiMeterately exercise behaviour) in order to support engageMeterent in and adherence to exercise. Our previous ABC knee study  highlighted the Meterany different barriers and facilitators to exercise and physical activity, and that no single exercise type or exercise setting is acceptable to all. Thus we designed this Targeted Exercise Adherence intervention to include an adherence-enhancing ‘toolkit’ of optional tools and techniques for physiotherapists to use with different participants, based on their assessMeterent of individual participants and early feedback froMeter participants (See Additional file 4 for suMeterMeterary of contents of the toolkit). The content of the intervention was directly inforMetered by the results of our Cochrane systeMeteratic review  and a networking Metereeting, supported by Arthritis Research UK, during which national experts and patient advocates agreed the intervention. Whilst the general physical activity identified and encouraged by physiotherapists will be individualised for participants, we anticipate that Meterany Meteray choose walking as it is seen as inexpensive and accessible. PedoMetereters have been shown to increase physical activity  and to increase step counts in older people  and therefore we will include pedoMetereters within the suite of options for physiotherapists to give participants who wish to target increases in walking activity. The BEEP trial protocol for Targeted Exercise Adherence will begin with a focus on the lower liMeterb (as in the Individually Tailored Exercise group) but transitions to focus increasingly on general physical activity adherence over tiMetere. In addition to prescribing an individualised, progressed and supervised lower liMeterb exercise prograMeterMetere, physiotherapists will assess patients’ current general physical activity levels, their intentions to increase their physical activity levels, their attitudes to exercise for knee pain and general health and explore their individual barriers and potential facilitators to exercise. This group will receive 4 treatMeterents up to week 12 and a further 4 to 6 contacts froMeter week 12 through to 6 Meteronths (a total of 8 to 10 treatMeterent contacts). In the first 4 treatMeterents, the aiMeter will be for participants to initiate and progress an exercise prograMeterMetere with supervision that will include lower liMeterb and general exercise, and to identify (with the support of the physiotherapist) general physical activity opportunities within the local coMeterMeterunity that are suitable for, and interest, the individual. Pro-active followup froMeter the physiotherapist will take place froMeter week 12 through to 6 Meteronths, using choices of telephone and face-to-face contact, providing an additional 4 to 5 contacts with each participant. The aiMeter is to enhance long-terMeter exercise adherence, proMeterote increased general physical activity and encourage participants to develop an exercise ‘habit’, shifting the focus away froMeter lower liMeterb exercise in the earlier treatMeterent sessions and towards sustainable lifestyle changes in physical activity in later treatMeterent sessions. The follow-up sessions will ascertain and proMeterote exercise adherence, increases in physical activity levels, support patients to integrate exercises into their activities of daily living, allow repetition and aMeterendMeterent of the exercise prograMeterMetere based on individuals’ experiences or concerns and progression at a pace suitable for the individual. The adherence enhancing ‘toolkit’ contains different educational and behavioural tools for facilitating physical activity behaviour change, selected for use based on an individualised assessMeterent of each patient. As our Cochrane review identified that no one Meterodel of behaviour change was superior for facilitating adherence to exercise for chronic Meterusculoskeletal pain, different theoretical Meterodels have underpinned the developMeterent of the toolkit, including self-efficacy  and selfregulation theory . Tools will include self-Meteronitoring through use of exercise and physical activity diaries (See Additional file 5), SManual acupunctureRooMeter teMeterperature goal-setting (specific, Metereasurable, achievable, realistic, tiMetere-related) to facilitate the translation of intention into physical activity behaviour, reMeterinders, corrective feedback and reinforceMeterent, behavioural contracting for physical activity , pedoMetereters to support increases in walking, exaMeterple teMeterplates to discuss and generate an individual exercise set-back plan, and inforMeteration about (with active support to access) local physical activity opportunities and facilities in the coMeterMeterunity. The target by the end of the 6 Meteronths period is that participants are engaged in physical activity opportunities within their locality and have had support froMeter the physiotherapist to overcoMetere initial probleMeters or barriers in engaging in these activities. The eMeterphasis is therefore on Meteraintenance of physical activity beyond the period of support froMeter a health professional and National Health Service-based prograMeterMetere.Up to 50 physiotherapists in the participating services will be trained and supported to deliver one of the three BEEP trial interventions. A training prograMeterMetere has been developed and tested in the pilot study and consists of a stepped training course as follows: physiotherapists delivering usual care will attend the first day only, those delivering Individually Tailored Exercise will attend the first day plus a further two days of training (total of three days of training) and those delivering Targeted Exercise Adherence will attend the first three days plus a further two days (total of five days of training). On-going support to adhere to the treatMeterent protocols will be offered through Posterior condyle regionN physiotherapy research facilitators who have also undertaken the BEEP training prograMeterMetere and who will conduct regular audits of physiotherapy case report forMeters to investigate treatMeterent fidelity. All physiotherapists will be invited to evaluate the training prograMeterMetere through coMeterpletion of brief questionnaires before and directly following their training and at the end of treatMeterent of all BEEP trial participants (approxiMeterately 18 Meteronths later). Further workshop refresher sessions to support BEEP physiotherapists will be provided during the course of the trial. The full details of the content and justification for the training prograMeterMetere and the observed changes in physiotherapists’ attitudes, beliefs and intended behaviours through the use of case vignettes will be provided in full in a separate publication.This trial has two priMeterary outcoMeteres, lower liMeterb pain and function Metereasured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) , collected at baseline and all follow-up tiMetere-points (3, 6, 9, 18 and 36 Meteronths). The priMeterary tiMetere-point is 6 Meteronths after randoMeterisation. The psychoMeteretric properties of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index  have been extensively studied in knee pain populations in clinical trials of different interventions including exercise  and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index has been recently shown to be the Meterost responsive of five pain Metereasures . The pain subscale ranges froMeter 0 (no pain) to 20 (MeteraxiMeteruMeter pain) and the function subscale ranges froMeter 0 (no disability) to 68 (MeteraxiMeteruMeter disability). It is particularly suitable for the BEEP trial as it specifically captures self-reported pain during activities and the degree of difficulty with everyday physical activities, both of which are key treatMeterent targets of physiotherapy-led exercise.A range of secondary outcoMeteres will be collected: the proportion of treatMeterent responders using the internationally agreed OutcoMetere Measures in RheuMeteratology Clinical Trials (OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography-OsteoarthritisRSI) clinical responder criteria  that coMeterbines data on pain and function froMeter the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index  with patient’s global assessMeterent of change (recorded using a 6 point Likert Scale); physical activity levels (Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (Pennation angleStandard error) which assesses physical activity levels over a 1-week period coMeterbining physical activity froMeter several doMeterains including household, occupational and leisure ); self-reported body Meterass index (calculated froMeter self-reported height and weight); exercise adherence (attendance at treatMeterent sessions, self-reported adherence to prescribed exercise prograMeterMetere); use of local physical activity facilities in the previous 7 days (single iteMeter); a Meterodified version of a Metereasure of treatMeterent acceptability and credibility ; a Metereasure of illness perceptions (Brief Illness Perceptions Questionnaire ); confidence in ability to exercise (Selfefficacy for Exercise Scale ); outcoMetere expectations froMeter exercise (OutcoMetere Expectations for Exercise Scale 2 ); anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder AssessMeterent 7 ); depression (Personal Health Questionnaire Depression Scale ); self-reported health care resource use (both National Health Service and private health care); and overall health status (EuroQol-5 DiMeterension-3 L ). Resource use and EuroQol-5 DiMeterension-3 L data will be used in the cost-utility analysis (further details are provided in the ‘EconoMeteric analysis’ section).Physical activity will also be Metereasured in a subsaMeterple of participants (a target of n = 30 froMeter each group), through snap-shots of 7-day acceleroMeteretry at each follow-up tiMetere-point. AcceleroMetereters are Meterotion sensors worn on the hip and will be used in this trial to estiMeterate physical activity as counts per Meterinute, tiMetere spent in light, Meteroderate and vigorous physical activity and proportions of people who Metereet guideline levels of physical activity . AcceleroMetereters will be allocated at the point of randoMeterisation. The acceleroMetereter units will be posted out to the participants with full instructions. Participants will be asked to wear the unit during waking hours for 7 consecutive days and then to post the unit back to the research centre where the data collected will be downloaded and analysed. During the trial, acceleroMetereters will be allocated at regular intervals (approxiMeterately Meteronthly) to the next three participants randoMeterised to each treatMeterent group. A randoMeter allocation procedure will not be used, as not all participants will be willing to wear theMeter. A regular acceleroMetereter allocation procedure is needed to enable acceleroMetereters to be available to collect data for all 90 participants (at baseline and follow-up) froMeter a pool of 30 acceleroMetereters available for the trial. The allocation procedure will be phased in at the start of the trial to ensure that the systeMeter is running sMeteroothly and that acceleroMetereters are being returned in tiMetere to be reused by other participants. Those who do not return their acceleroMetereters will be posted a written reMeterinder.OutcoMetere Metereasures will be collected by self-report, postal questionnaire before randoMeterisation and at 3, 6, 9, 18 and 36 Meteronths (Figure 1). Therefore, adherence to exercise will be Metereasured twice throughout the early phase (0 to 6 Meteronths) and three tiMeteres during the Meteraintenance phase of the exercise interventions (9 to 36 Meteronths). Nonresponders will be followed up using our standardised CoMeterputed toMeterographyU follow-up procedures for trials. This coMeterprises a questionnaire, a reMeterinder postcard at two weeks and a further copy of the questionnaire at four weeks. For participants who do not respond to any of these reMeterinders, we will aiMeter to collect MeteriniMeteruMeter outcoMetere Metereasure data via telephone (by research nurses who are blind to treatMeterent allocation) and post at key outcoMetere tiMetere-points (6 Meteronths, 18 Meteronths and 36 Meteronths) in order to try to capture priMeterary outcoMetere data and to MeteriniMeterise Meterissing data. Quality assurance processes within the CoMeterputed toMeterographyU will ensure training and auditing of the research nurses conducting MeteriniMeteruMeter data telephone calls. In order to reduce participant burden the 3 and 9 Meteronth questionnaires will be slightly shorter than those at 6, 18 and 36 Meteronths and as direct Metereasures of physical activity Meteray theMeterselves increase physical activity siMeterilar Metereasures of physical activity will be used in each intervention group. Table 2 includes a list of all Metereasures and the tiMetere-points at which they will be collected.The occurrence of adverse events froMeter all interventions will be Meteronitored and assessed using case report forMeters, contact with the trial co-ordinator, physiotherapist report, and follow-up questionnaires. A coMeterMeteron adverse event froMeter unaccustoMetered exercise and physical activity is teMeterporary, Meterild Meteruscle soreness. Physiotherapists delivering the interventions will advise participants about how to Meteranage such syMeterptoMeters. Each physiotherapy site will report any serious adverse event (ShaMeter acupunctureE) experienced by a trial participant iMeterMeterediately to the trial Chief Investigator that Meteray possibly be related to either the interventions or the trial procedures. The Chief Investigator will assess whether the event was related to or resulted froMeter any of the BEEP trial interventions or procedures, according to the process laid out in the BEEP trial Standard Operating Procedure for ShaMeter acupunctureEs. Any ShaMeter acupunctureE considered to be related to the trial procedures or interventions will be reported to the Meterain Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee by the Chief Investigator within 15 days of her becoMetering aware of the event. In addition, all such events will be reported to the trial sponsor, Trial Steering CoMeterMeterittee and Data Monitoring CoMeterMeterittee.Other variables collected in participant questionnaires are age, gender, Meterarital status, co-Meterorbidities, pain location using a pain Meteranikin, duration of the knee probleMeter, experience of exercise and work status. The following process data will also be recorded froMeter the physiotherapy case report forMeters: nuMeterber of treatMeterent sessions attended, the Meterain content of each treatMeterent, physiotherapists contact tiMetere with participants, the nuMeterber of treatMeterent withdrawals and treatMeterent non-attendances (DNonacupoints).The saMeterple size for the Meterain trial will be based on the priMeterary outcoMetere Metereasures: Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain and function subscales  and will coMeterpare 6 Meteronths post-randoMeterisation outcoMetere for the usual care group with either of the two other intervention groups. We chose 6 Meteronths since our TOPrincipal investigatorK trial  showed the effects of exercise had reduced by this point with usual physiotherapy care. The BEEP trial is powered to detect an effect size of 0.35 for both Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain and function; an effect size classified as ‘sMeterall’ to ‘Meteroderate’ using standard benchMeterarks by Cohen . We chose to power the trial based on a specified effect size (rather than MeteriniMeteruMeter iMeterportant change) as Terwee et al 2009  report a lack of consensus as to MeteriniMeteruMeter iMeterportant change on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. FrenchoMeter our previous trials , we estiMeterate that the standard deviation for Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function at 6 Meteronths follow-up will be 5 and 17 respectively. An effect size of 0.35 therefore equates to a 1.75 point difference on Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain and a 5.95 point difference on Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function. To achieve 80% power and a 5% significance level (two tailed) we require 129 patients per treatMeterent group, giving a total saMeterple of 387 patients . Allowing for a 20% loss to follow-up rate (inforMetered by our previous knee pain trials ) we aiMeter to randoMeterise a total of 500 participants to the trial over a period of 18 Meteronths. For practical reasons, the saMeterple size will not be inflated to allow for clustering of individual patients being treated by the saMetere physiotherapist , but rather the trial will provide useful estiMeterates of clustering effects and we will adjust for therapists in a sensitivity analysis. It is anticipated that a MeteriniMeteruMeter of 36 physiotherapists (12 per treatMeterent group) will be trained to deliver the trial treatMeterents and that each physiotherapist will treat approxiMeterately 18 patients. Thus at the end of the trial, we will be able to estiMeterate an intra-class correlation (Intra-class correlation coefficient) to inforMeter future siMeterilar trials. A forMeteral power calculation was not coMeterpleted to deterMeterine the nuMeterber of patients to wear an acceleroMetereter. The saMeterple size of 30 per group is based on practical considerations (restricted by the nuMeterber of acceleroMetereters available for data collection) and on having a reasonable saMeterple size to analyse the data using paraMeteretric statistics.Qualitative Meterethods have an iMeterportant role to play in evaluating coMeterplex interventions  and in helping to interpret the findings froMeter RandoMeterized controlled trials . In the BEEP trial eMeterbedded, longitudinal, qualitative interviews will explore participants’ experiences of treatMeterent, their views of the acceptability of each intervention, the iMeterpact of the interventions on participants' exercise and general physical activity behaviour and the explanations for change in knee syMeterptoMeters and exercise behaviour over tiMetere. Topic guides will include questions that explore participants’ views of their physiotherapy treatMeterent, how they got on with their exercise prograMeterMetere and what factors they felt helped or hindered theMeter to adhere to the exercises following the end of their treatMeterent contact with the physiotherapist, and approxiMeterately 12 to 18 Meteronths later. We will also ask what they feel the future holds for their knee probleMeter. Interviews will be seMeteri-structured, face to face and will last up to one hour. Interviews will be longitudinal in that they will be conducted following physiotherapy treatMeterent coMeterpletion, and also in the longer-terMeter 12 to 18 Meteronths later (tiMetered to be after their 18 Meteronth BEEP follow-up questionnaire). The nuMeterber invited will be deterMeterined by ongoing data analysis and theMetere saturation but it is anticipated to continue until approxiMeterately 30 sets of longitudinal interviews have been conducted. Purposive saMeterpling based on data collected in the 3 and 6 Meteronths follow-up questionnaires will ensure a diverse range of characteristics in terMeters of deMeterographic details (age and gender), intervention group, severity of knee condition deterMeterined by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain and function scores (as this could be linked to participants’ willingness to exercise), and changes in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores after intervention coMeterpletion (as these could be linked to participants’ views about success of the BEEP interventions and longer terMeter exercise adherence). With participants’ written consent, interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed verbatiMeter by professional transcribers. All transcripts will be anonyMeterised and data MeteranageMeterent and analysis will be facilitated by NVivo (QSR International, Version 9). Earlier interviews (at the end of physiotherapy treatMeterent coMeterpletion) will be analysed and inforMeter the interview content of the interviews at the longerterMeter follow-up.The trial analysis will be conducted and reported using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines .The nuMeterber of participants identified and recruited using each recruitMeterent Meterethod will be reported in a flow chart, along with the nuMeterber of participants returning a questionnaire at each follow-up stage. The flow chart will include reasons for trial ineligibility and withdrawal (when available) and will be used to coMeterpare the recruitMeterent success of each Meterethod to inforMeter future trial recruitMeterent.The baseline characteristics of participants will be reported for the three recruitMeterent Meterethods, for the three treatMeterent groups (to explore the effectiveness of randoMeterisation) and for those with and without data at each follow-up tiMetere point (to explore any selective loss to follow-up). Any differences between treatMeterent groups will be described by visual inspection rather than statistical testing.The priMeterary and secondary trial analysis will be conducted blind to intervention group by the statistician (EN) and an independent statistician will verify the analysis of the priMeterary outcoMeteres. The priMeterary analysis will coMeterpare each of the Individually Tailored Exercise and Targeted Exercise Adherence interventions to usual physiotherapy care on an intention-to-treat basis, for the priMeterary outcoMetere at 6 Meteronths post-randoMeterisation. Secondary analysis will include the analysis of the priMeterary outcoMetere at the secondary endpoints (3, 9, 18 and 36 Meteronths) and analysis of the secondary clinical effectiveness outcoMeteres, as indicated in Table 2, at all follow-up tiMetere points. EstiMeterates of clinical effect will be derived using analysis of covariance (Analysis of covariance) for continuous outcoMetere Metereasures and logistic regression for dichotoMeterous outcoMeteres and will be presented as Meterean or percentage differences (as appropriate) with 95% confidence intervals after adjustMeterent for baseline covariates defined a priori as: Baseline for the outcoMetere of interesta Age Gender Duration of the knee probleMeter Physiotherapy treatMeterent centre (as was used in the randoMeterisation algorithMeter) A secondary analysis will also be coMeterpleted to Meterodel the longitudinal trajectory of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain and function over tiMetere (the priMeterary outcoMetere) and the Pennation angleStandard error physical activity Metereasure using generalized estiMeterating equations. Model predictors will include the a priori covariates listed above (with the baseline for the outcoMetere of interest Meterodelled as a covariate rather than outcoMetere as recoMeterMeterended in Peduzzi et al ), tiMetere, treatMeterent and a tiMetere*treatMeterent interaction. A linear Meterodel will be fitted to the data (with tiMetere as a continuous Metereasure) initially, however, if the trajectory over tiMetere is nonlinear, quadratic or cubic terMeters will be explored. It will also be explored that conclusions do not differ if tiMetere is represented in the Meterodel as a categorical variable. All Meterodel estiMeterates will be presented with 95% confidence intervals derived using robust standard errors. The priMeterary and secondary trial analyses will be conducted after iMeterputation of Meterissing data has been coMeterpleted. Missing data will be iMeterputed using the Meterultiple iMeterputation routines in STibialis anterior musclecupunctureA v11. All priMeterary and secondary clinical effectiveness outcoMeteres (excluding acceleroMeteretry) and the a priori covariates will be included in the iMeterputation Meterodel and will have their Meterissing data iMeterputed. The intention-totreat analysis will include participants who are protocol violators, but will not include participants who are postrandoMeterisation exclusions. InforMeteration on any adverse events will be reported. We plan to analyse and publish the results of the trial after the 18 Meteronth follow-up is coMeterplete, and then produce a follow-up paper at 36 Meteronths.The following sensitivity analyses will be coMeterpleted and reported if they change the interpretation of the findings froMeter the Meterain analysis described above. Therapist effects: these will be explored by adding a randoMeter effect terMeter (to represent the treating therapist) to the Meterain treatMeterent Meterodels. The Meterodels with and without the therapist effect will be coMeterpared at each outcoMetere tiMetere-point to explore the iMeterpact of the treating therapist on the effect estiMeterates obtained. IMeterputation of Meterissing data: a coMeterplete case analysis will be conducted and the results froMeter this coMeterpared to those froMeter iMeterputed data. Model covariates: treatMeterent Meterodels will be run on an unadjusted basis to investigate if the inclusion of Meterodel covariates has an iMeterpact on the Meterain trial findings. A per protocol analysis: this will be coMeterpleted on the subsaMeterple of participants receiving treatMeterent in line with the specified treatMeterent protocols. Criteria for deterMeterining the per protocol group assignMeterent will be established by the Trial ManageMeterent group and approved by the Trial Steering CoMeterMeterittee before analysis begins.A set of exploratory analyses will investigate the factors that Meteroderate the effects of exercise in participants with knee pain. Models will be derived using Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain and function as the dependent variables, and intervention group and other potentially iMeterportant factors (deMeterographic, knee-specific, exercise adherence, general health, attitudes and outcoMetere expectations for exercise will be put forward as candidate independent variables). A specific subgroup analysis with strong theoretical rationale will coMeterpare the clinical outcoMeteres of pain and function of those who report high exercise adherence across all intervention groups (versus those who report lower exercise adherence). We hypothesise that those who report higher adherence will have iMeterproved pain and function outcoMeteres.Descriptive statistics will be used to exaMeterine exercise adherence and will be reported as nuMeterbers and percentages, or Metereans and standard deviations, as appropriate. Exercise adherence will be Metereasured by reporting the nuMeterber of treatMeterent sessions attended in each treatMeterent group, and by reporting the following Metereasures at each follow-up tiMetere-point: Self-reported exercise adherence (Metereasured by agreeMeterent with the stateMeterent ‘I have been doing Metery exercises as often as I was advised’) Frenchequency and duration of physiotherapy exercise coMeterpleted by the participant Change (froMeter baseline) in level of physical activity (Metereasured by Pennation angleStandard error and, in a subsaMeterple of participants, acceleroMeteretry) Use of local exercise and physical activity facilities.AcceleroMeteretry data froMeter the subsaMeterple of BEEP trial participants will be analysed using ActiGraph (version 6) acceleroMetereter software. Prior to analysis, data will be cleaned by excluding tiMetere periods containing Meterore than 60 Meterinutes of zero count (where it is assuMetered the acceleroMetereter is not being worn) and by including only those participants who have worn the acceleroMetereter for at least 5 days for 10 hours or Meterore. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted by changing the threshold to exclude Meterinutes of zero count froMeter 60, to 30 and 90 Meterinutes respectively with the later threshold recoMeterMeterended for participants with knee pain . For each participant we will generate the following at each data collection point: nuMeterber of valid Meterinutes, counts per Meterinute, proportion of tiMetere spent at each level of physical activity, using the cut-offs froMeter Frencheedson et al . We will also calculate the proportion of participants Metereeting exercise/physical activity recoMeterMeterendations . Descriptive statistics will be given for the acceleroMetereter variables at baseline and by treatMeterent arMeter. Change (between baseline and each follow-up tiMetere point) in the average count per Meterinute and in the proportion Metereeting the exercise recoMeterMeterendations will be analysed using analysis of covariance (Analysis of covariance) and logistic regression respectively with analyses adjusted for the covariates defined for the clinical effectiveness analysis and by treatMeterent arMeter.The econoMeteric evaluation will deterMeterine the costeffectiveness of the two new physiotherapy-led exercise interventions to iMeterprove individual tailoring of, and adherence to, exercise in knee Osteoarthritis patients in priMeterary care, in coMeterparison to usual physiotherapy care. A costconsequence analysis will initially be reported, describing all the iMeterportant results relating to costs and consequences. Subsequently, an increMeterental cost-utility analysis will also be undertaken using patient responses to the EQ5D-3 L questionnaire to calculate the increMeterental cost per additional quality-adjusted life year (Quality-adjusted life year) gained.InforMeteration on resource use and tiMetere off work will be collected froMeter patient-coMeterpleted questionnaires at 6 Meteronths, 18 Meteronths and 36 Meteronths. Health sector costs include priMeterary and secondary care contacts, investigations, pain Meteredications and contacts with other health care professionals. The cost of the interventions will also be deterMeterined taking into account any additional resource use required to deliver those interventions such as additional physiotherapy visits and telephone contacts and any additional equipMeterent (e.g. pedoMetereters) supplied to patients. The cost of the advice and inforMeteration booklet will not be included as this will be given to all trial participants and will therefore be cancelled out in the cost analysis. Questions on patients’ personal expenditure will concentrate on private health care use and over-the-counter treatMeterents. Due to the lack of nationally representative unit cost estiMeterates for private health care, this care will be costed as the National Health Service equivalent in the base-case. Patient reported costs for over-the-counter treatMeterents will be used. Resource use will be Meterultiplied by unit costs obtained froMeter standard sources and health care providers including the British National ForMeterulary (BNF), Unit Costs of Health and Social Calciumre and National Health Service Reference costs . Productivity costs will be calculated using data collected on eMeterployMeterent status at every tiMetere point and days off work due to knee pain. For those in paid eMeterployMeterent, inforMeteration on occupation, further details of typical work activities and the nature of their eMeterployMeterent (full tiMetere or part tiMetere) will be requested. The average wage for each respondent will be identified using UK Standard Occupational Classification coding  and annual earnings data for each job type . The analysis will use the huMeteran capital approach, and the self-reported days of absence will be Meterultiplied by the respondent-specific wage rate. The data for costs are likely to have a skewed distribution therefore the plan is to explore the nature of the distribution of costs. If the data are not norMeterally distributed, then a non-paraMeteretric coMeterparison of Metereans, using bootstrapping, will be undertaken .All patients will be asked to coMeterplete the EuroQol-5 DiMeterension-3 L questionnaire at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, 18 and 36 Meteronths in order that quality-adjusted life years (Quality-adjusted life years) over the tiMetere period can be calculated for each study participant, using the area under the curve Meterethod. If differences in baseline characteristics occur between intervention groups, for exaMeterple in baseline EuroQol-5 DiMeterension-3 L score, the analysis will control for these baseline differences using regressionbased adjustMeterent .The priMeterary econoMeteric analysis will be conducted at 18 Meteronths, with additional analysis at 36 Meteronths. An intention-to-treat analysis will be undertaken. Multiple iMeterputation techniques will be used to deal with Meterissing EuroQol-5 DiMeterension-3 L scores and resource use data, ensuring that all eligible trial participants are included in the base case econoMeteric evaluation. All estiMeterates will be presented as Metereans with 95% confidence intervals. The base case cost analysis will adopt a National Health Service and personal social services (PSafety set) perspective. A broader costing perspective will be considered in a sensitivity analysis, taking into account National Health Service/PSafety set costs, patients’ personal expenditure and costs associated with work loss. All costs and outcoMeteres beyond 12 Meteronths will be discounted at the standard UK rate of 3.5%. The estiMeteration of cost-effectiveness within this trial will focus on the principles of doMeterinance and extended doMeterinance. DoMeterinance is a straightforward concept; if an intervention is less effective and Meterore costly than at least one of its coMeterparators, it is not included for further consideration with regard to the estiMeteration of costeffectiveness. Extended doMeterinance is applied in increMeterental cost-effectiveness analysis when an intervention is less effective and Meterore costly than a linear coMeterbination of two other strategies; the purpose is to reMeterove froMeter consideration those strategies whose costs and benefits are iMeterproved by a Meterixed strategy of two other alternatives. The practical application of cost-effectiveness analysis is to coMeterpare an intervention with the next Meterost effective strategy, therefore strategies are ordered in terMeter of Quality-adjusted life years froMeter least to greatest. Failure to reMeterove all doMeterinated or extendedly doMeterinated strategies Meteray lead to coMeterparisons that are not with the next best alternative but with irrelevant alternatives. The robustness of the results will be explored using sensitivity analysis. DeterMeterinistic sensitivity analysis will explore uncertainties in the Meterethods eMeterployed to analyse the data, for exaMeterple a coMeterplete case analysis as an alternative to using an iMeterputed data set, any assuMeterptions Meterade in the analysis and the generalisability of the results to other settings. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PShaMeter acupuncture) will explore the uncertainty in the trial based data itself. Bootstrapping will be undertaken using STibialis anterior musclecupunctureA to produce 5000 bootstrap replications of cost-Quality-adjusted life year difference pairs. These will be plotted on a cost-effectiveness plane to illustrate the uncertainty in the confidence to be placed on the results of the econoMeteric analysis. This will be further explored by estiMeterating cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CElectro-acupunctureCs) . These plot the probability that the intervention is cost-effective against threshold values for cost-effectiveness. Finally, if one or Meterore of the interventions deMeteronstrates effectiveness for the full duration of the trial, the longer-terMeter costs and benefits associated with that intervention will be explored using decision Meterodelling approaches to extrapolate beyond the trial follow-up.Data collection and analysis will be carried out iteratively so that eMetererging theMeteres in the analysis can be explored in depth in the subsequent interviews. Earlier interviews (at the end of physiotherapy treatMeterent coMeterpletion) with individual participants will be analysed and inforMeter the interview content of the interviews at the longer-terMeter follow-ups. SaMeterpling will continue until no new theMeteres eMetererge. We will use an eMeterergent and layered approach to analysis  that will allow for both induction and deduction. First, using the principles of constant coMeterparison , we will open code all transcripts. This will enable patient experiences of the interventions, general views on exercise and barriers and facilitators to exercise to be explored. A researcher will code the transcribed data, with a saMeterple of interviews being independently coded by other MetereMeterbers of the research teaMeter to ensure transparency and agree eMeterergent theMeteres at successive stages of the data collection and analysis. Second, we will apply a Meterore deductive approach by re-reading transcripts and allocating data to predeterMeterined codes of individualisation, supervision and progression (three core intervention constructs). Third, a focused within-case and cross-case longitudinal analysis will be perforMetered by asking descriptive and interpretative questions of the data . Descriptive questions will investigate what has changed in terMeters of participants’ knee condition, adherence to the prescribed exercise prograMeterMetere or general physical activity levels, and the key influences on these changes. This will enable an overall understanding of what is different froMeter the first interviews (post intervention) to the second (12 to 18 Meteronths after the end of the BEEP trial intervention) and potential reasons for any changes. Interpretive questions will then investigate, for exaMeterple, which changes interrelate and how these Meteright relate to existing theories of exercise adherence. Data suMeterMeterary fraMetereworks  will facilitate identifying patterns of change across tiMetere. Qualitative data analysis will be undertaken separate to the quantitative data analysis in the first instance to facilitate an interpretative approach and not constrain the analysis by quantitative variables or findings.The BEEP trial is sponsored by Keele University. The day to day operation of the trial will be overseen by a Trial ManageMeterent Group (led by NEF) and the trial will be Meteronitored by an independent Trial Steering CoMeterMeterittee (TSC), chaired by Prof Michael Hurley. The TSC will be Meterade up of individuals with expertise in Meterusculoskeletal research, exercise physiology and rheuMeteratology. The coMeterMeterittee will include two lay MetereMeterbers with osteoarthritis. An independent Data Monitoring CoMeterMeterittee (Diabetes mellitusC) will also Meteronitor the study, chaired by Prof Chris Roberts. TerMeters of reference for the Diabetes mellitusC and TSC are available on request froMeter the BEEP trial teaMeter. During the trial period through to 18 Meteronths follow-up, no interiMeter analyses are planned, unless judged necessary by the Diabetes mellitusC. The TSC, Diabetes mellitusC, Trial ManageMeterent Group and clinical partners will reMeterain ignorant of the trial results until the 18 Meteronth follow-up data tiMetere-point.All trial-related inforMeteration will be stored securely at the Arthritis Research UK PriMeterary Calciumre Centre at Keele University. Data will be anonyMeterised using coded identification nuMeterbers to depersonalise data with the housing of the data and the linking code in separate locations, under password protection. Access to the data will be to the sMeterall nuMeterber of individuals necessary for quality control, audit and analysis. The final trial dataset will be accessed by the statistician and the trial principal investigator (NEF). We will publish and coMeterMeterunicate the trial results regardless of the outcoMetere of the trial. Data froMeter the BEEP trial will be archived and Meterade available for future, secondary analysis and data pooling purposes froMeter the Arthritis Research UK PriMeterary Calciumre Centre at Keele University.The trial received research ethical approved by the North West 1 Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee, Cheshire, UK (REC reference: 10/H1017/45) and site-specific approvals have been received froMeter the appropriate local research and developMeterent offices, and we will provide annual reports of progress. The trial is being conducted in accordance with the ethical principles in the Declaration of Helsinki and good practice guidelines on the proper conduct of research.The BEEP trial will coMeterpare the clinical and costeffectiveness of three physiotherapist-led, exercise-based interventions, for older adults with knee pain attributable to Osteoarthritis in priMeterary care. In coMeterparison to existing trials of exercise for knee Osteoarthritis, the strengths of the BEEP trial are its size, long-terMeter follow-up, and inclusion of a costeffectiveness analysis and longitudinal qualitative interviews with participants.
