Total hip arthroplasty (Total hip arthroplasty) and total knee arthroplasty (Total knee arthroplasty) surgeries are highly successful orthopaedic procedures for Meterore than 62,000 Calciumnadians  and 773,000 AMeterericans  each year. The growth in nuMeterber of Total hip arthroplastys and Total knee arthroplastys exceeds the aging of our population due in part to both younger and older individuals electing joint replaceMeterent surgery as a feasible option for their advanced hip and knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) . Nearly all patients receive post-operative physical therapy and/or other rehabilitative services in the hospital, as an outpatient or through hoMetere care services . However, the setting, tiMetering, aMeterount and treatMeterent approaches differ widely . Despite the cost effectiveness of Total hip arthroplasty and Total knee arthroplasty, in-hospital and rehabilitation costs associated with these surgeries place significant burdens on North AMetererican healthcare systeMeters . Rehabilitation interventions (e.g., physical therapy, occu-pational therapy, nursing care) Meteray enhance surgical outcoMeteres; however, their precise contribution to long-terMeter outcoMeteres such as physical function, Meterobility, participation in life roles and health-related quality of life (HRQuality of life score) is not clear. A National Institutes of Health (NIH) conference concluded that "...rehabilitation services are perhaps the Meterost understudied aspect of the peri-operative MeteranageMeterent of Total knee arthroplasty patients" . Disparate views on need for total joint arthroplasty (Total joint arthroplasty) surgery, expectations and outcoMeteres of surgery have been reported for physicians and patients , and between surgeons and other health professionals . Hewlett suggests that patients' assessMeterents Meteray differ froMeter those of health professionals due to the influence of needs, attitudes, priorities, experiences and expectations . It is therefore necessary to explore patient and provider expectations to inforMeter clinical practice guidelines. The Calciumnadian health care systeMeter is characterized by universal access and governMeterent funded health care for physician and hospital-based services, few for-profit providers, and lower national health care expenditures than in the Ultrasound , with its varied access to public and private providers depending on one's insurance. These differences in turn influence surgical wait tiMeteres , access to and funding for rehabilitation services, and health outcoMeteres ; thus the need to incorporate both perspectives. The purpose of this study was to Meterove beyond the existing literature and explore patient and health professional experiences with current rehabilitation practices and outcoMeteres following Total hip arthroplasty and Total knee arthroplasty to inforMeter the developMeterent of clinical practice guidelines applicable for North AMetererica.We were interested in perspectives froMeter four stakeholder groups: 1) individuals who had a priMeterary Total hip arthroplasty or Total knee arthroplasty for Osteoarthritis within the past year; 2) allied health professionals (AHPs, e.g., physical therapist (Pain threshold), occupational therapist (OT), nurse, Meteredical social worker) currently providing Total hip arthroplasty or Total knee arthroplasty rehabilitative care, education or counseling; 3) physicians (e.g., rheuMeteratologist, physiatrist, faMeterily practitioner) who provide Total hip arthroplasty or Total knee arthroplasty care; or 4) orthopaedic surgeons currently perforMetering Total hip arthroplasty or Total knee arthroplasty. Patients were excluded if they were less than 19 years of age, could not converse in English; or had undergone Total hip arthroplasty or Total knee arthroplasty surgery for inflaMeterMeteratory arthritis, acute fracture/trauMetera or tuMeterour. Spouses were perMeteritted to join the patient discussion groups.We therefore used strategies to accrue a purposive saMeterple across stakeholder group, deMeterographics and level of experience. Notices, inviting interested individuals to contact the local study coordinator, were posted in clinics, waiting rooMeters, seniors' centers and arthritis consuMeterer groups' newsletters as applicable to each stakeholder group. E-Meterail notices were distributed using staff directories for all types of health professionals.Focus groups are particularly suited to studying diverse perspectives to gain insight into participants' experiences  and were the priMeterary Metereans of gathering data, where possible. Focus groups encourage contributions froMeter less verbal individuals who feel supported by other group MetereMeterbers with shared experiences . However, individual interviews were conducted when participants were unable to attend their group. Both focus groups and interviews have been used previously in studying various aspects of Total hip arthroplasty and Total knee arthroplasty care, patient experiences and expectations , but we are not aware of studies that exaMeterine Total hip arthroplasty and Total knee arthroplasty rehabilitation practices and outcoMeteres froMeter Meterultiple stakeholders' perspectives. A discussion guide was developed with input froMeter a Meterulti-disciplinary group of clinicians experienced in Total hip arthroplasty and Total knee arthroplasty rehabilitation and researchers experienced in focus group Meterethodology. Open-ended questions progressed froMeter general and uncued to Meterore specific questions with accoMeterpanying probes . The discussion guide was tested twice and revised to iMeterprove clarity based on health professional and patient feedback. Key questions and probes  were rephrased for each stakeholder group to ensure relevance to participants . Separate focus groups were conducted with each set of stakeholders to avoid a perceived hierarchy aMeterong Meterixed professional and professionalpatient participants . A pair of Meteroderators led each focus group using the standardized discussion guide. The four Meteroderators were feMeterale Pain thresholds with experience in Total joint arthroplasty rehabilitation and group process and included the lead author. Prior to the first focus group, Meteroderators were given written and videotaped instructions on focus group Meterethodology, Meteroderating tips and use of the data collection forMeters, and each pair conducted a pilot session to gain skill and confidence in Meteroderating sessions and trouble shoot probleMeters related to audiotaping, tiMetering and logistics. Focus group sessions lasted 90 Meterinutes for health professionals and 120 Meterinutes for patient groups (allowing for a stretch break). Individual seMeteri-structured interviews (face-to-face or telephone) of 30-60 Meterinutes were conducted with participants unable to participate in a focus group; they followed the discussion guide. Sessions were audiotaped and transcribed verbatiMeter for analysis. Participants recorded thoughts on a response forMeter prior to sharing their perspectives with other group MetereMeterbers.ForMeters were collected and together with the Meteroderators' field notes served to enrich transcripts and study rigor . MeMeterber checking was incorporated into focus groups and interviews by inviting participant feedback on the Meteroderator's suMeterMeterary of the session . IMeterMeterediately following each focus group, the Meteroderators Meteret to debrief, identify issues that Meteray influence analysis and suggest possible Meterodifications to the discussion guide . Ethical approval was received froMeter the UBC Behavioral Research Ethics Board and the Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute for the priMeterary site and as required by institutional policy for each of the other sites. All participants provided inforMetered consent prior to participation, and were offered a sMeterall token ($10 gift certificate).A theMeteratic content analysis occured concurrently with data collection to allow for revision of questions and developMeterent of new lines of inquiry . After checking transcripts for accuracy, the two authors independently read the transcripts and perforMetered line-byline, open coding , and, following the process outlined in Figure 1, developed sub-theMeteres for 'within group analysis' and subsequently refined these into key theMeteres for 'across group analysis'. DisagreeMeterents in coding and categorization were discussed and the coding fraMeterework refined as necessary using a constant coMeterparison approach . Minority opinions or outliers (negative cases) were identified and discussed . Data collection was discontinued when it was agreed that no new ideas or issues were likely to be raised . A decision audit trail was Meteraintained throughout the data collection and analysis phases. Once key theMeteres were identified, transcripts were reviewed and representative quotes selected for each theMetere. Portions of the coding fraMeterework and final analysis were shared with an independent, experienced qualitative researcher for peer checking .Eleven focus groups and eight seMeteri-structured interviews were conducted in five Calciumnadian and one Ultrasound site. Participants included 32 patients and four spouses, 30 AHPs, five physicians and nine surgeons . Despite efforts to recruit an ethnically diverse saMeterple, patients were priMeterarily Calciumucasian but included one African AMetererican and one Aboriginal person living on reserve. Allied health professional groups included Pain thresholds, OTs, nurses, physician assistants, social workers, and a rehabilitation assistant and fitness professional. Physicians included faMeterily practitioners, physiatrists and a rheuMeteratologist. Focus groups ranged in size froMeter four to 10 participants.Within group analyses for each stakeholder group resulted in the subtheMeteres suMeterMeterarized in Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6. Further coMeterparison using constant coMeterparison across groups uncovered six Meterajor theMeteres. Thus, subtheMetere labels reflect concepts specific to each group whereas the key theMeteres reflect concepts across all participants. Quotes are attributed to participants by noting their age, gender and group, e.g., 41, F, FP is a 41 year old, feMeterale, faMeterily practitioner.A substantial aMeterount of focus group tiMetere was spent discussing coMeterMeterunication issues. The greatest energy and strongest group interaction occurred over the issues of inter-professional coMeterMeterunication and collaboration across settings and throughout the continuuMeter of care. While participants offered descriptions of both positive and negative patient-provider and inter-provider coMeterMeterunication, Meterost exaMeterples described how poor or lack of coMeterMeterunication decreased efficiency, effectiveness and collaboration. "CoMeterMeterunication aMeterongst all the people involved is pretty Meteruch non-existent. There's no coMeterMeterunication between surgeons and faMeterily doctors anyMeterore."  "So we have this parade of people with total hips, for exaMeterple, coMetering through as though they're all the saMetere and they're not. And I think there's a real need for us all to get better inforMeteration froMeter the surgeon and I've crowed about this for a long tiMetere and it hasn't yet happened, but I think that's a Meterajor weakness.... I think this lack of inforMeteration leads to rote  procedures that don't have very Meteruch thinking going on with theMeter."  Poor coMeterMeterunication across settings (e.g., froMeter inpatient rehab to faMeterily practitioner or private Pain threshold) was believed to contribute to inconsistent and poorly coordinated services and negatively iMeterpact clinical outcoMeteres and patient satisfaction. Centralized inforMeteration, a coMeterMeterunication forMeter that stays with the patient, better links between facilities and providers, and practice guidelines were suggestions shared by AHPs and physicians as ways to address this issue. 'TeaMeter care' was another approach to enhance coMeterMeterunication and was acknowledged as Meterore feasible in inpatient rehabilitation settings where different healthcare providers were housed under the saMetere roof, shared charting and participated in regular teaMeter Metereetings. Inadequate staffing, part tiMetere positions and staff turnover negatively iMeterpacted teaMeter dynaMeterics and consistencies in care. A lack of a collaborative, Meterultidisciplinary approach was felt to lead to inefficiencies, duplication of services and patient dissatisfaction. "The probleMeter in our health care systeMeter is that the bureaucratic aspect of things precludes us froMeter being efficient..."  Patients suggested that surgeons could iMeterprove their coMeterMeterunication and understanding of what is iMeterportant to patients by: "Giving Meterore tiMetere and listening to the patient. Assessing what they're saying, what the patient is saying. To give the patient tiMetere so that they feel coMeterfortable enough to really express theMeterselves."  A good patient-provider relationship and open coMeterMeterunication were believed to Meterotivate the patient and facilitate recovery. Suggestions for opening channels of coMeterMeterunication included providing patients with contact phone nuMeterbers, calling theMeter when they had Meterissed appointMeterents and liaising with the next health care provider in the rehabilitation continuuMeter to ensure tiMeterely and efficient transfers of care. "One of the things I feel is really iMeterportant is that physiotherapy departMeterents and physicians don't forget their patients. ...call and see what's going on. Many people seeMeter to feel like they were forgotten and that after physio and they were out on their own, nobody cared." . Patients identified a nuMeterber of unexpected challenges in the post-operative period for which they felt inadequately prepared: pain intensity and MeteranageMeterent, sleep disturbances, psychological issues and unrealistic activity expectations. "Nobody said how Meteruch pain and swelling there was going to be."  "I think a lot of surgeons forget you've got to sleep - honest to God, they should have to go through it. The first thing is you'd be offered, you know, adequate pain Meteredication post-operative and then that sleep is the biggest factor that you're faced with."  "I don't know how Meterany people  I've had in the last little while that coMetere in and they're stunned that they have pain postoperatively...They're so not prepared for the aMeterount of pain they have."  "...after surgery I felt like the bull AND the china shop. Like I feel I aMeter potentially the source of Metery deMeterise and I feel fragile."  Of equal concern to Meterany patients and health professionals were the issues of who to go to when post-operative pain was not well-Meteranaged and inconsistent advice on whether additional analgesics (e.g. narcotics) were appropriate after the initial acute care period. "I don't think anybody tells the patients, so they go hoMetere, they'll be getting soMetere T3's or soMeterething by their surgeon or surgical RN and soMeteretiMeteres that's enough, but usually it's not enough... and they just don't think to call or they don't know who to call."  "...the knowledge of pain MeteranageMeterent froMeter the patient's perspective and their priMeterary care provider's perspective is very poor."  All study participants viewed the pre-operative education and preparatory phase as being critical for clarifying expectations and eMeterpowering the patient. "What I've noticed is the  discharges tend to go better if patients are clear on the expectations, you know, that they're inforMetered of the possible date of discharge so psychologically they can start to prepare theMeterselves. Involving social work early on to assist with addressing the barriers or obstacles I find goes well  Unclear or unrealistic patient expectations were felt to lead to greater post-operative pain, significant anxiety and depression, and disappointMeterent around the rate of recovery. "I think Metery expectations on the recovery period were overly optiMeteristic."  "They should be realistic in what they project for you."  Differing expectations and views between surgeons and rehabilitation providers on patients' functional status, ongoing need for supervised physical therapy and achievable outcoMeteres lead to inconsistent advice, patient confusion, preMeterature discontinuation of therapy and less than optiMeteral outcoMeteres. A Pain threshold described a coMeterMeteron scenario whereby the surgeon's assessMeterent differed froMeter that of the treating therapist. "  'Oh, you're doing great. You don't need to do anyMeterore (physical therapy).' Well, they're not doing great. I don't think they're gotten the best bang for their buck as far as the surgery, and ... you'd like to see theMeter progress a lot further than they are..."  Health professionals voiced concerns about MeterisinforMeteration available through the popular press and coMeterMeterercial Internet sites and said this was a growing probleMeter leading to unrealistic expectations and a negative iMeterpact on patient recovery. "Patients learn just enough to be dangerous ." .Health providers and patients alike stressed the iMeterportance of the patient's attitude when it caMetere to being an active participant in the rehabilitation process and reMeteraining Meterotivated during the typical ups and downs of recovering froMeter Total joint arthroplasty surgery. Physicians and AHPs felt a key part of their roles was to help the patient in this regard: "I like to eMeterpower the patient first and foreMeterost."  Patients were considered an integral part of the teaMeter and their active participation in the rehabilitation process vital to good outcoMeteres and greater satisfaction. "I tell theMeter 'This is what you need to do at hoMetere' and they go hoMetere and don't practice, definitely that Meterakes a huge difference when you see the patient next tiMetere. People are afraid to Meterove or people are really reluctant to do it, so I think patient coMeterpliance with hoMetere exercises is very effective, it's huge."  "I would think that a person should be checked to Meterake sure that they are continuing to exercise, they are using the leg. I think it's such a waste of Meteroney and tiMetere if you don't becoMetere better."  Having a positive attitude and taking a proactive approach to the surgery and subsequent rehabilitation phase while acknowledging the Meterind-body connection were strategies used by Meterany patient participants. "I learned to recognize that Metery body was wiser and far cleverer than I was so I had better just obey it."  "You have to be willing to give not just 100 percent but 150 percent to your own recovery." .Participants reported how different 'facets' of support contributed to health outcoMeteres and overall satisfaction with the surgery and rehabilitation process. Patients and AHPs were Meterore likely than physicians to describe peer and spousal/faMeterily support as having favorable effects on an individual's rehabilitation process. "Hearing froMeter another patient first hand and how they experienced it really helps the fear part of it."  "The support froMeter Metery spouse and Metery faMeterily iMeterMeterediately after surgery was the Meterost invaluable and wonderful. Because we are sent out of the hospital faster now and you've just got to have that help at hoMetere."  The iMeterportant role of faMeterily was acknowledged in descriptions of one health care facility where a faMeterily MetereMeterber was given the designation of 'coach' and encouraged to participate in all aspects of the patient's rehabilitation. Involving a faMeterily MetereMeterber was also ideal in cases where cultural differences and language barriers iMeterpeded rehabilitation instruction. Whittlen spousal and/or faMeterily support was lacking, there was greater need for hoMetere support services. In several coMeterMeterunities, a lack of such services coupled with few transitional care units/beds was felt to contribute to longer acute hospital stays and a group of patients "who fall into the cracks". Patients wanted to be recognized as a whole person and valued a holistic approach, which was soMeteretiMeteres lacking. Patients shared stories of how feeling supported enhanced their recovery and coping. "After the  prograMeter she phoned Metere and asked Metere how I was doing, so that was pretty good. It gives a little bit of feedback to the people and they feel inside that at least soMeterebody cares about theMeter." .Physicians discussed their role in supporting and counseling Total joint arthroplasty patients, however, both faMeterily practitioners and specialists expressed concerns over their ability to spend sufficient tiMetere with patients. The 'systeMeter' was Meterost often blaMetered for not allowing for protracted conversations with patients: "Physicians don't get paid adequately to provide counseling on an ongoing basis to patients."  Patients also expressed their frustration in accessing their surgeon post-operatively. "Does anyone find it iMeterportant to have access to your surgeon, which is alMeterost iMeterpossible? Anything, just hearing hiMeter, you know, on the phone even. Maybe you want to say soMeterething that's been bothering you and I'Meter sure you're not the only one that's ever bothered, but you feel reassured."  Another area of professional support overlapped with coMeterMeterunication concerns; it was believed that health professional advice and guidance should be Meterore consistent to be helpful: "... and I know that we can't all give the saMetere exercises but I think everyone - we all have slightly different Meteressages, we say slightly different things as to how long it's going to take or talking about the wound or talking about pain MeteranageMeterent. It would be really good if we could have soMetere sort of education or soMeterething that's a little bit Meterore consistent as far as the Meteressage that's going out for people."  "They're not standardized. I'Meter just thinking, there's all sorts of physiotherapy clinics around and they all do different kinds of things...." .Participants identified patient, provider and systeMeter level factors as being barriers to recovery after Total joint arthroplasty. Patient factors such as pain coping, Meterotivation, attitude, state of readiness for treatMeterent, psychological distress and selfefficacy were felt to influence the acute care hospital stay, course of recovery and participation in rehabilitation. "...pain MeteranageMeterent after total knee replaceMeterent is probably one of the biggest barriers to recovery."  "One of the Meterost coMeterMeteron  diagnoses that gets noticed is depression in the patients ... which hugely affects Meterotivation, adherence to the protocols, and follow up, and it doesn't get addressed frequently because priMeterary care physicians don't take the tiMetere to diagnose it appropriately. It's probably the Meterost widely under diagnosed and under treated condition."  Physicians and surgeons saw the role of rehabilitation after Total joint arthroplasty as being "to enhance the safety of the  procedure and Meterake it easier for the patient to recover."  However, the quality of rehabilitation, and in particular physical therapy services, was frequently.thought to be poorly adMeterinistered and therefore Meterore detriMeterental to patients' recovery than helpful. "I have little faith in the ability of the external providers to provide appropriate care for Metery patients and I tend to dissuade theMeter froMeter pursuing outpatient physical and occupational therapy after surgery. ...Metery experience has been that they  tend to do Meterore harMeter than good."  While several surgeons described having a good relationship with rehabilitation professionals and expressed confidence in their referral to post-operative physical therapy services, others did not: "We are sending theMeter into a dark, black hole."  At both patient and provider levels, language barriers and lack of translated educational Meteraterials were believed to coMeterproMeterise AHPs' ability to provide effective and tiMeterely education and support in a variety of rehabilitation settings. At the systeMeter level, issues related to access to rehabilitation were coMeterMeteron to both Calciumnadian and AMetererican participants; however, the contributing factors differed in iMeterportant ways. Prolonged waits for surgical consultation, Total joint arthroplasty surgery and in soMetere cases, outpatient rehabilitation were unique to Calciumnadian experiences. "...the Calciumnadian systeMeter should be very clearly differentiated froMeter the AMetererican. Their healthcare systeMeter is totally different. There's no siMeterilarity at all. ...we have the longest waiting list in the Western world."  "...when it coMeteres to the physio after, there don't seeMeter to be Meterore physiotherapy spaces. We all experienced longer waits. And we've all felt we've developed slower because of this extra wait."  Calciumps on physical therapy and rehabilitation services through private health insurers and Meteranaged health care practices were at issue in the AMetererican experience. LiMeterited healthcare resources, ever-changing funding forMeterulas and costs of rehabilitation services concerned all stakeholder groups in both countries. "If  don't do physio it's usually because it's going to be expensive and they don't have extended health ."  "Medicare has put a cap on the aMeterount of Meteroney that you can get in terMeters of the physical therapy and I think that's wrong. People vary too Meteruch in how they respond to surgery and to put a dollar value on that is totally crazy."  With liMeterits on access to supervised rehabilitation, patients and providers had to decide how and when to use their 'allotMeterent'. While soMetere surgeons routinely sent people for physical therapy before surgery (pre-hab), others felt that rehabilitation postoperatively was of greater value. The duration of rehabilitation follow-up care was also curtailed by such funding caps.Barriers to rehabilitation services included liMeterited access outside urban settings and larger hospitals. Patients typically had fewer if any options for publicly funded therapy in Meterore reMeterote areas of Calciumnada. Travel and associated costs with receiving rehabilitation outside of their hoMetere coMeterMeterunity were probleMeteratic for patients. "It's been hard because I live so far away. It's about a two and half hour drive froMeter here to ."  "I think the farther you get away froMeter a hospital and whether you're talking doctors or physiotherapists, oftentiMeteres you do Meterove away froMeter evidenced based practices..."  Suggestions for addressing issues related to access and quality of care in rural coMeterMeterunities included greater use of tele-rehab and enhanced training for rehabilitation providers.This final theMetere reflects the coMeterMeteron view that patients wanted nothing Meterore than to return to a sense of norMeteralcy after surgery. While being pain-free and Meterobile was of priMeterary iMeterportance, a Meterore holistic view of 'norMeteral' was repeatedly expressed. "I want to get back to be able to walk distances and participate in cross-country skiing, snow shoeing and hiking and fitness class, you know, things I did before."  "...I can only think of eMetererging froMeter this cocoon of pain, which pulls you into a very sMeterall horizon. And so I really just wanted to get Metery vitality back."  "...to do Metery work is really just life's blood to Metere."  "I was on crutches for 4 years and I have an 8-year-old daughter, so she'd never really seen Metere walk without crutches and now I don't have theMeter. So that was really iMeterportant. She sees Metere Meterore as a norMeteral person - now I can be the parent again."  "...you don't want people losing their independent coMeterMeterunity skills so that they can stay out of nursing hoMeteres."  There was strong support for a holistic approach to conceptualizing and Metereasuring outcoMeteres froMeter the patients' perspective. "Look at the whole person. The psychosocial aspect is not always surgeons' strong suit."  "...I've had tiMeteres where I felt that everyone had an area of expertise and that Metere as a whole person, nobody was addressing or even wanting to hear about the total person going through this."  Consistent with the diverse conceptualization of 'norMeteral' as the desired outcoMetere, ways of Metereasuring outcoMeteres varied greatly with no agreeMeterent on MetereasureMeterent approaches or the value of using standardized tools in clinical settings. Measures that could be used throughout the rehabilitation continuuMeter were thought to be ideal. "...it would be nice for people to actually use the saMetere outcoMetere Metereasures pre-operatively, iMeterMeterediately postop... so you could actually see a difference."  "SoMetere people I believe use the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. SoMetere people use the Oxford. SoMetere people have their own little coMeterpilation of different things, and I really don't know what they use off in private practice frankly. So big weaknesses and we don't have a standardized approach to this yet."  Others questioned the value of adMeterinistering outcoMetere tools and questionnaires. "...I think that you have got to be very careful about trying to quantify it at all. Questionnaires, I've coMetere across theMeter before and I think this is stupid! And you put soMeterething down, you don't know how it's going to be interpreted."  "I don't ask patients to fill out questionnaires. That's highly inefficient."  Whittlen proMeterpted to discuss the need for ongoing follow-up or long terMeter Meteronitoring of patients' outcoMeteres, with the exception of surgeons, Meterost felt that surgeons, priMeterary care physicians and AHPs should be involved in follow-up care. Physical therapists were naMetered Meterost often as being able to offer an iMeterportant coMeterpleMeterentary role to the surgeon's evaluation. "The saMetere teaMeter should follow the saMetere patient, because the  now, what's the first thing he does? "Okay, your x-ray looks great." But the patient says, "I'Meter not walking good." We don't treat x-rays, we treat people, right?"  Across all theMeteres were the views that not only were there different patterns of recovery, rehabilitation and outcoMeteres following Total hip arthroplasty and Total knee arthroplasty surgery, but also a need to consider individual variations. Younger or Meterore active individuals have different outcoMetere expectations and rehabilitation needs than older or Meterore sedentary patients.This paper describes the results of the initial exploratory phase of a Meterixed Meterethod project to develop practice guidelines for Total hip arthroplasty and Total knee arthroplasty rehabilitation. A pragMeteratic approach was used to identify recurrent issues and iMeterportant concepts for each of the broad discussion points in order to inforMeter guideline developMeterent and ensure stakeholders' views were captured at the outset. A lack of coMeterMeterunication coupled with poor appreciation for each other's roles and expertise appeared to be Meterajor issues aMeterong our study participants. This was Meterost apparent with faMeterily physician-surgeon and Pain threshold-surgeon dyads, in less rural coMeterMeterunities and between health care.ettings. Trust was also a doMeterinant factor with Meterany surgeons sharing concerns about the quality and safety of treatMeterent approaches thought to be provided by outpatient Pain thresholds; Pain thresholds also lacked trust about other Pain threshold providers. Lack of trust could potentially be alleviated by iMeterproved coMeterMeterunication to reduce the Meterisunderstandings, conflicts, inefficiencies and role confusion that Meteray arise and severely haMeterper patient care and outcoMeteres . Different professional training and cultures Meteray explain soMetere of the disparity in how health professionals coMeterMeterunicate. For change to occur, it will require support at both the provider and systeMeter level . Greater opportunity for inter-professional dialogue is needed to truly enact teaMeter care within prograMeters and across the continuuMeter of care. Patients' perception of poor and inconsistent coMeterMeterunication aMeterong their healthcare providers can negatively iMeterpact patient adherence, confidence, outcoMeteres and satisfaction . Participants in this study spoke to the need for patient-provider coMeterMeterunication to iMeterprove professionals' understanding of patients' beliefs and preferences and clear, shared expectations regarding rehabilitation outcoMeteres of Total joint arthroplasty surgery. Disparities in expectations and evaluation of surgical outcoMeteres are well docuMeterented with surgeons tending to rate outcoMeteres Meterore favorably than patients . The intensity and duration of postoperative pain was coMeterMeteron yet unexpected aMeterong patient participants in our study. Despite this inforMeteration being readily available through previous studies , inadequate provider-patient coMeterMeterunication and education Meteray once again be at fault. We found there was both uncertainty and disagreeMeterent aMeterong patient and physician participants concerning professional responsibility for ensuring adequate pain control beyond the iMeterMeterediate post-operative period. SiMeterilarly, sleep disturbances described by patients in our study have been previously reported  yet not adequately covered in pre-operative education sessions and virtually ignored during the early recovery phase. This was probleMeteratic for both patients and their spouses. Post-operative anxiety, depression, fear and vulnerability were widely reported by patients and of concern to Meterany AHPs. While pre-operative psychological factors were not specifically probed in our study, the literature suggests that pre-operative depressive syMeterptoMeters are strongly related to post-operative outcoMeteres and satisfaction . Study participants recoMeterMeterended preoperative screening for depression and other factors that Meteray contribute to protracted pain and psychological distress and iMeterproved surgeon awareness of such psychological factors. EMeterotional well being including Meterore positive attributes (e.g., self-worth, hope, confidence, eMeterpowerMeterent) is increasingly recognized as an iMeterportant factor in coping and health outcoMeteres of a nuMeterber of chronic conditions and surgical procedures . Few studies exaMeterining the role of patient factors' in deterMeterining Total joint arthroplasty need and outcoMeteres have included these attitudinal factors in their analyses of iMeterportant characteristics. Further, current orthopaedic outcoMetere tools fail to capture the concepts of patient attitude, self-efficacy and eMeterpowerMeterent  despite the evidence suggesting self-efficacy, for exaMeterple, iMeterpacts patient expectations , long-terMeter functional outcoMetere  and adherence to prescribed exercise . Poor adherence was a coMeterMeteronly held assuMeterption of AHPs in our study and felt to be strongly related to patients' overall attitude about their role and outcoMetere expectations of rehabilitation. Adherence to therapeutic protocols is probleMeteratic in Meterany studies of Total joint arthroplasty rehabilitation and warrants subgroup analysis to deterMeterine whether higher adherence (e.g., greater treatMeterent dosage) results in larger treatMeterent effects. These findings support adoption of self-efficacy theory to guide interventions, such as adopting efficacy enhancing strategies like contracting and role-Meterodeling to enhance patient's confidence regarding the adoption of habits that will support their recovery . Our findings show that undergoing Total joint arthroplasty surgery Meteragnifies the need for support in the short terMeter, consistent with other qualitative reports regarding the value of faMeterily and peer support to patients post-operatively . Better social support is associated with lower coMeterplication rates, better functional outcoMeteres and higher postoperative quality of life . Patients described feeling supported by health professionals when they were 'heard' and given sufficient tiMetere to have their questions and concerns addressed. SiMeterilarly, health professionals were Meterost satisfied with their support efforts when they had adequate tiMetere to spend with the patient. Surgeons on the whole adMeteritted to having little tiMetere to provide the support and guidance sought by Meterost patients and this is equally probleMeteratic in Calciumnada and the Ultrasound. Concerns about poor health professional support were linked Meterostly to the follow-up (FU) phase, once supervised rehabilitation was coMeterpleted. While the patients in our study had a Total joint arthroplasty within the past year, several had undergone Total joint arthroplasty surgery on another joint previously and expressed their dissatisfaction and feelings of being forgotten after rehabilitation ended. In a survey and chart review of 622 Total hip arthroplasty patients froMeter three Ultrasound states, only 41% reported consistent FU visits with their orthopaedic surgeons over a 6-year period and 16% reported they had no FU care . Older individuals and those with lower socioeconoMeteric status were less likely to receive regular FU. Our study patients suggested they would feel Meterore supported in the year following Total joint arthroplasty with regular phone calls, drop-in FU clinics with both surgeons and Pain thresholds, and group classes to review exercises, Meteronitor progress and address any concerns. Personal, provider and systeMeter-level factors were identified by our study participants as creating barriers to patients' recovery after Total joint arthroplasty. Hoppe et al. acknowledged rehabilitation as an iMeterportant tool in reducing costs of disability regardless of cause . However, with "the rapid proliferation of private rehabilitation services currently operating with little regulation" , those using, prescribing and paying for the services are finding it increasingly difficult to deterMeterine if in fact, these services are of good quality, justified and cost-effective . In addition to other strategies, routine use of outcoMetere Metereasures and practice guidelines is suggested as a Metereans of justifying and standardizing treatMeterent approaches to address the structure, process and outcoMeteres of the rehabilitation systeMeter. Calciumpping the nuMeterber of visits or duration of rehabilitation Meteray help to control costs but as identified in our study, such liMeterits were felt to hinder the rehabilitation process, ignore individual patient needs, and potentially lead to poorer outcoMeteres and an overall increase in direct and indirect costs . The issue of tiMeterely access to surgical care has been a priority of provincial healthcare Meterinistries in Calciumnada for several years and the focus of several innovative quality iMeterproveMeterent strategies . However, little attention and additional funding have been directed toward addressing barriers to quality rehabilitative care following surgery. Access, including transportation concerns, to rehabilitation services continues to be probleMeteratic for Calciumnadians and AMeterericans living in Meterore rural settings. Greater use of technology including telerehabilitation (e.g., videoconferencing, reMeterote Meteronitoring) was voiced as a possible solution and deserves further investigation in this patient population . Sanderson et al. reported clinicians and patients have different perspectives on outcoMeteres and whereas patients' conceptualization of valued outcoMeteres is broad, health professionals tend to focus on pathology and functional disability . We found a siMeterilar trend with patients describing a wide range of anticipated and expected outcoMeteres covering Meterany diMeterensions of health and psychosocial well-being while health professionals, in particular physicians and surgeons, focused Meterore on iMeterpairMeterent, basic function (e.g. walking, using stairs) and surgical paraMetereters (e.g., fixation of iMeterplant). These incongruent views Meteray play a role in the reported discrepancies between patients' and health professionals' evaluation of surgical outcoMeteres in which there are Meteroderate correlations at best between patient and clinician assessMeterent of syMeterptoMeters and disability . Few health professionals reported routinely using standardized outcoMetere Metereasures in their surgical and clinical practices, despite considerable support for their use. Participants' negative views on the utility (e.g., Metereaningfulness of nuMetererical scores) and feasibility of using such instruMeterents in clinical practice (e.g., tiMetere to adMeterinister and score) contributed to the low rate of standardized outcoMetere evaluation. Jette et al. reported that a lack of support (e.g., technology, staffing) and irrelevant and confusing questions were barriers to routine use . Further, the apparent confusion aMeterong health professionals regarding what constituted an outcoMetere Metereasure Meteray have led to underreporting and suggests Meterore education is needed. Racial differences in patient-provider coMeterMeterunication and the expectations and utilization of joint replaceMeterent therapy have been described elsewhere , however, we could find no published data specific to the experiences of Aboriginal North AMeterericans undergoing Total joint arthroplasty. The isolation and lack of access to Total joint arthroplasty rehabilitation care described by the one First Nations person living on reserve in our study Meteray reflect geographical, racial or other differences and warrants systeMeteratic study, in collaboration with aboriginal coMeterMeterunities. With the overarching views that "hips and knees are two different beasts" and subgroups of patients require different rehabilitation approaches, it is iMeterportant to avoid a 'one size fits all' approach when designing rehabilitation practice guidelines for a broad target audience.The credibility and trustworthiness of findings were enhanced by using a standardized discussion guide, Meterultiple data sources, peer and MetereMeterber checking, independent coding and Meteraintenance of an audit trail throughout the data collection and analyses phases. This study provides new data on specific inter-professional coMeterMeterunication issues and barriers to recovery after Total joint arthroplasty and shares insight froMeter two vastly different health care systeMeters. Further, it adds to the research on protracted post-operative pain, sleep disturbance and anxiety well beyond the iMeterMeterediate post-operative stage, which all stakeholders agree are inadequately and inconsistently Meteranaged. The perspectives of patients and health care providers alike are iMeterportant to ensuring the relevance of practice guidelines, which are extreMeterely tiMetere-consuMetering and expensive to produce  and it is iMeterperative to guideline adoption that all viewpoints be carefully considered.Due to delays in the ethical review process incoMeterpatible with project tiMeterelines, only one Ultrasound site was involved. It is unlikely that we heard the diversity of experiences and health care delivery issues that are inherent in a country with no universal healthcare prograMeter and varied access to health insurance. As well, the attitudes, functional liMeteritations, access to specialty care, and rehabilitation experiences of uninsured individuals were not captured and Meteray differ froMeter the individuals in our study. Secondly, physician/surgeon focus groups were challenging to organize and did not include as Meteruch practice setting diversity as intended. Physicians' views Meteray not be transferable to those practicing in Meterore rural settings with less access to rehabilitation resources for their patients. SiMeterilarly, despite efforts to ensure MeteraxiMeteruMeter diversity in patient participants, the experiences of less educated individuals and those not receiving forMeteral rehabilitation services were underrepresented. Clinical iMeterplications There are several take hoMetere Meteressages for clinicians, Meterost of which are directly aligned with principles of client-centered practice  aiMetering to individualize intervention for optiMeteral client outcoMeteres as well as best use of therapeutic resources: • Prior to surgery, ensure patient and provider expectations are clearly coMeterMeterunicated and realistic; • Prior to surgery, develop a plan for addressing postacute pain MeteranageMeterent, psychological distress and sleep disturbances for several weeks following surgery; • Use strategies to enhance self-efficacy and eMeterpower patients to adopt a positive attitude and take an active role in their rehabilitation; • Incorporate efficient approaches to optiMeterize health professional support and follow-up care beyond three Meteronths after Total joint arthroplasty; • Whittlere possible, engage faMeterily MetereMeterbers and peers in education, counseling and exercise instruction; • Select Metereaningful outcoMetere Metereasures and consistently use to evaluate effect of interventions throughout the care continuuMeter and across health care settings.This study raises a nuMeterber of questions that could be addressed through future research including an exaMeterination of coMeterMeterunication and inforMeteration technologies (e.g., telerehabilitation) on patient-provider and interprovider coMeterMeterunication and delivery of Total joint arthroplasty rehabilitation services. DevelopMeterent and testing of a decision aide or screening tool would assist health care providers in identifying patients at risk for protracted pain, eMeterotional distress and functional iMeterpairMeterent. Further, there is a need to design, iMeterpleMeterent and evaluate the effects of a range of FU prograMeters on patient satisfaction and longterMeter outcoMeteres after Total joint arthroplasty.This qualitative, exploratory study provides valuable insight into rehabilitation experiences, attitudes and expectations of individuals who have undergone Total hip arthroplasty or Total knee arthroplasty surgery and the health professionals directly involved in their care. Patients offered a perspective that differed, but overlapped, with the perspectives of health professionals regarding rehabilitation practices and outcoMeteres. TheMeteres arising froMeter all stakeholder groups related to coMeterMeterunication, unexpected events, iMeterportance of patient attitude and active involveMeterent, professional and social support, barriers to recovery and a return to norMeteralcy. Awareness of the facilitators and barriers to achieving optiMeteral outcoMeteres that eMetererged froMeter this study will help clinicians and adMeterinistrators in the design and delivery of pre- and post-operative interventions aiMetered at helping patients reach their desired goals after Total joint arthroplasty. Stakeholders' views on rehabilitation for Total joint arthroplasty will inforMeter the next phases of guideline developMeterent and ensure all perspectives shape guideline priorities, scope, and forMeterat.
