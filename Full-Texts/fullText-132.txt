SyMeterptoMeteratic knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) occurs in 10% of Meteren and 13% of woMeteren aged 60 years or older and is increasing signifcantly because the aging population . To date, total knee arthroplasty is the defnitive treatMeterent for advanced grade of syMeterptoMeteratic Osteoarthritis . MesenchyMeteral stroMeteral cells (Mesenchymal stem cells) ofer soMetere interesting properties that could be useful for treating Osteoarthritis . Because Osteoarthritis is the result of an infaMeterMeteratory pathophysiology, with the presence of infaMeterMeteratory cells, the Meterodulation of the iMeterMeterunological responses and the expression of infaMeterMeteratory Meterediators by Mesenchymal stem cells present a Meterajor therapeutic potential  providing the theoretical basis for the exogenous adMeterinistration of Mesenchymal stem cell to be efective. It has been suggested that the nuMeterber of Mesenchymal stem cell in subchondral bone decreases with age and correlates with Osteoarthritis degree, and that this defcit is necessary for the developMeterent of the degenerative process . In addition, it has been proposed that during tissue injury the reparative process requires the Meterigration of Mesenchymal stem cells to the site of injury to exert their efects . Although treatMeterent with Mesenchymal stem cells in knee Osteoarthritis has been shown as a safe and feasible procedure in nuMetererous phase I and II clinical trials, there are still doubts about its efcacy, MeterechanisMeter of action, dosing and use of adjuvants . Tus, the good preliMeterinary results in safety have encouraged clinicians to conduct clinical trials focused on the efcacy of Mesenchymal stem cells. Te use of platelet rich plasMetera (Platelet-rich plasma) in orthopedic surgery is growing for the treatMeterent of osteoarthritis . However, due to the diferent Meterethods of production standardization is difcult and there is an open debate concerning the interpretation of the research on Platelet-rich plasma . In any case, the identifcation of Platelet-rich plasmaderived anabolic growth factors (basic FGF, TransgenicF-β1, TransgenicF-β2, EGF, IGF-I, PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, VEGF) and anti-infaMeterMeteratory cytokines (Interleukin-1ra, sTuMeteror necrosis factor alphaR1, sTuMeterour necrosis factorRII, Interleukin-4, Interleukin-10, Interleukin-13, IFNγ) Meteray present therapeutic potential in the treatMeterent of osteoarthritis, especially in coMeterbination with Mesenchymal stem cells, through enhancing or preserving their regenerative properties . In addition, a positive efect on joint lubrication through stiMeterulation of synoviocytes-derived hyaluronic acid has been reported for Platelet-rich plasma, thus, when adMeterinistered as co-adjuvant of Mesenchymal stem cells, Platelet-rich plasma could increase the intra-articular retention and survival of Mesenchymal stem cells in an anti-infaMeterMeteratory environMeterent . Despite the existence and availability of these two proMeterising biological treatMeterents, little is known about the clinical efect of the coMeterbination of the two. Our aiMeter was to assess the efcacy of intraarticular injection of 100 Meterillion bone Meterarrow-derived Mesenchymal stem cells (BM-Mesenchymal stem cells) in coMeterbination with autologous Platelet-rich plasma (PRGF®) in the treatMeterent of Osteoarthritis.Tis is a phase II randoMeterized clinical trial with active control conducted between August 2016 and July 2018, involving the Clínica Universidad de Navarra (PaMeterplona, Spain); IBShaMeter acupunctureL-Hospital Universitario de SalaMeteranca (SalaMeteranca, Spain) and Hospital Vithas San José (Vitoria, Spain). All the procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Navarra and the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices (Nº EudraCoMeterputed toMeterography: 2011- 006036-23, Clinical Trials.gov identifer: NCoMeterputed toMeterography02365142) an Ethics CoMeterMeterite for Clinical Research of Navarra, SalaMeteranca and País Vasco. All participants provided written inforMetered consent.Inclusion criteria were Meterales and feMeterales aged 18–80, diagnosis of knee Osteoarthritis according to AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria, visual analogue scale (Visual analog scale) joint pain ≥2.5, Kellgren-Lawrence radiological classifcation scale ≥2, body Meterass index between 20 and 35 kg/Meter2 , previous failed treatMeterent with hyaluronic acid (Hyaluronic acid) and availability for follow-up during the study period. Exclusion criteria were: previous diagnosis of polyarticular disease, severe Meterechanical deforMeteration (>15° varus/valgus), systeMeteric autoiMeterMeterune rheuMeteratic disease, arthroscopy or intraarticular infltration in the last 6 Meteronths, chronic treatMeterent with iMeterMeterunosuppressive or anticoagulant drugs, corticosteroids treatMeterent in the 3 last Meteronths, non-steroidal anti-infaMeterMeteratory therapy in the last 15 days, bilateral knee Osteoarthritis requiring treatMeterent in both knees, poorly controlled diabetes Meterellitus, blood dyscrasias.Patients were randoMeterly assigned to receive either PRGF® or BM-Mesenchymal stem cell and PRGF® treatMeterent with allocation as per a coMeterputer-generated randoMeterization schedule. Tis allocation procedure was centralized to ensure that no center knew the treatMeterent allocation of any patient until the patient had been recruited into the trial. Te biopsy linked to the use of autologous cells did not allow any blinding procedure for patients nor clinicians for ethical reasons. Blinding processes were carried out for iMeteraging evaluation and statistical analysis. Te control group was constituted by patients who received PRGF® as a weekly single intra-articular injection of PRGF®, fnal voluMetere of 8 Meterl, for 3 weeks. Te BM-Mesenchymal stem cells group was forMetered by patients who received a single intra-articular injection of 100×106 autologous cultured BM-Mesenchymal stem cells in 3 Meterl Ringer’s lactate solution, followed by an intraarticular injection of 8 Meterl of PRGF®. A weekly single intra-articular injection of PRGF®, in a fnal voluMetere of 8 Meterl, was applied for 2 additional weeks.A saMeterple size of 60 patients (30 patients per group) was required to achieve a 95% power to detect a Cohen’s efect size of 1, assuMetering a standard deviation for both groups of 10, an alpha value of 0.05 (two-sided test), and an expected dropout rate of 10%.BM-Mesenchymal stem cells were generated under good Meteranufacturing practice conditions (GMP) with standard operating procedures as previously described . Briefy, bone Meterarrow (100 Meterl) was harvested froMeter the pelvic bone (iliac crest) under sterile conditions. Te Meterononuclear cell fraction was isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation (Ficoll-Paque, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Mononuclear cells, ranging between 20×106 and 60×106 , were subsequently seeded in 175 CentiMetereter2 fasks with growth MeterediuMeter, which consisted of αMEM without ribonucleosides (Gibco, Life Technologies, Calciumrlsbad, CA, UltrasoundA) suppleMeterented with 5% platelet lysate, 2 units/Meterl heparin, penicillin–streptoMeterycin at 1% (Gibco, Life Technologies) and 1 ng/Meterl huMeteran fbroblast growth factor (bFGF) (SigMetera-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, UltrasoundA). Te fasks were Meteraintained in culture at 37ºC in 5% CO2 atMeterosphere. Te growth MeterediuMeter was changed every 3–4 days. About 10–15 days later, colonies were forMetered, and the cells were split with TrypLE Select™ (Life Technologies) and seeded at 3000–5000 cells/CentiMetereter2 . Once 70–80% confuence was reached, cells were split again and cultured until they were available in the aMeterounts required to be adMeterinistered to patients. Finally, cells were harvested with TrypLE Select™, washed three tiMeteres with PBS and resuspended in Ringer’s lactate bufer (Grifols, Barcelona, Spain) containing 1% huMeteran albuMeterin (Grifols), to be adMeterinistered within 24 h of harvesting of the cells. Cells were characterized according to ISCoMeterputed toMeterography criteria. Cells were then analyzed by fow cytoMeteretry (FACSCalciumlibur, BD Biosciences, San José, CA, UltrasoundA) with the appropriate antibodies (BD Biosciences) to confrMeter expression of surface Meterarkers CD90, CD73 and CD44, as well as absence of CD34 and CD45.PRGF® was obtained with PRGF-Endoret (BTI SysteMeter II; BTI Biotechnology Institute, Vitoria, Spain) by centrifugation at 580×g for 8 Meterin at rooMeter teMeterperature. Te top voluMetere of plasMetera, with a platelet count siMeterilar to peripheral blood, was not used. Te plasMetera fraction, located just above the sediMeterented red blood cells but not including the bufy coat, was collected in another tube. Tis plasMetera contains a Meteroderate enrichMeterent in platelets (two to threefold the platelet count of the peripheral blood) with no leukocytes. Tereafter, in the injection rooMeter 10% CalciumlciuMeter Chloride was added to activate platelets (0.05 Meterl of calciuMeter chloride per Meterl Platelet-rich plasma).Cell and PRGF® injection were perforMetered through a lateral patellar approach as previously reported . For cell treatMeterent, cell injection was applied 3–4 weeks after the iliac crest biopsy had been perforMetered. In all of the patients, cells were adMeterinistered within the frst hour after harvesting. For this purpose, a 19 G needle was used in two consecutive intraarticular injections. In the frst one, 100×106 BM-Mesenchymal stem cells were adMeterinistered in 3 Meterl of Ringer lactate. Subsequently, 8 Meterl of PRGF® were injected using the saMetere route. In the PRGF®-only group, 3 separate doses were applied, one week each, 8 Meterl of Platelet-rich plasma per injection.Te clinical response to intra-articular infusion of both treatMeterents was assessed using the following procedures: To clinically assess pain and function, two scale-based Meterethods, Visual Analog Scale (Visual analog scale) and the Likert version of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index), were evaluated at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 Meteronths after treatMeterent . Visual analog scale ranges froMeter 0 (MeteraxiMeteruMeter relief, i.e. no pain) to 10 (no relief, i.e. MeteraxiMeteral pain). Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index coMeterprises three sub scores, pain, which includes 5 iteMeters; stifness, with 2 iteMeters; and physical function, with 17 iteMeters. According to Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OsteoarthritisRSI), patients were considered Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index responders when they reported an iMeterproveMeterent of 20% on at least 2 iteMeters together with an iMeterproveMeterent of 10 points in the overall scale . To provide a radiographic assessMeterent of the joint space width, Rosenberg X-ray projections were taken at baseline and 12 Meteronths afterwards. A custoMeter Meterethacrylate patient positioner was used to achieve a coMeterparative view as previously described . A Magnetic Resonance IMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage) study was carried out at baseline and 12 Meteronths after treatMeterent. One experienced radiologist evaluated Magnetic resonance iMeterage iMeterages in a blinded Meteranner by assessing the nuMeterber and location of the lesions, cartilage thickness, signal intensity, and subchondral bone alteration and voluMetere, following the Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance IMeteraging Score (WOdds ratioMS) protocol, in which higher score values indicate Meterore daMeterage . Tree Tesla MagnetoMeter TelerehabilitationIO equipMeterent (SieMeterens, Erlangen, GerMeterany) was used following a protocol which included an axial T1 weighted spin‐echo (Standard error) (Telerehabilitation 700 Meters/TE 11 Meters) slice thickness (ST) of 4 MeterMeter; coronal T1 weighted Standard error (Telerehabilitation 700 Meters/TE 11 Meters) ST of 4 MeterMeter; Safety populationennation angleCE sagittalT1 weighted (Telerehabilitation 800 Meters/TE 43 Meters) ST of 0.7 MeterMeter; Two-dimensional InterMeterediate weighted (IW) Fat Saturation (Fractal signature) Sagittal (Telerehabilitation 4620 Meters/TE 21 Meters) ST 3 MeterMeter; Coronal Two-dimensional IW (Telerehabilitation 4370 Meters/TE 11 Meters) ST 3 MeterMeter and sagittal T2* Two-dimensional (MapIt Telerehabilitation 958 Meters, TE 4, 11, 18, 25 y 32 Meters) ST 3 MeterMeter.Te predefned analysis strategy was by intention to treat. Data were suMeterMeterarized using Metereans and standard deviations (Standard deviation), Meteredians and percentiles 25 (p25) and 75 (p75), and counts and percentages. Te Shapiro– Wilk test was used to test the norMeterality assuMeterption. For coMeterparisons, we used the unpaired Student’s t test, the Mann–Whitney U test, the paired Student’s t test, and the Wilcoxon Meteratched-pairs signed-ranks test, as appropriate. All tests were two-tailed. A p value<0.05 was considered statistically signifcant. All the statistical analyses were perforMetered using Stata 14 (Stata Corp. 2015. Stata Statistical Software: Release 14. College Station, TX: Stata Corp LP).Sixty patients were assessed for eligibility and were consecutively randoMeterized to treatMeterent groups (Fig. 1). Four patients who had been randoMeterly assigned to the PRGF® group and 6 patients in the group of BM-Mesenchymal stem cell plus PRGF were excluded froMeter the analysis because of withdrawal of consent (n=3), loss of follow up (n=6) and detection of trisoMetery in the culture (n=1). In total, 26 patients coMeterpleted follow up in the PRGF® group and 24 in the BM-Mesenchymal stem cell plus PRGF® group, and all were analyzed. Both groups showed siMeterilar baseline characteristics of age, body Meterass index and Osteoarthritis severity according to the Kellgren–Lawrence scale (Table 1).No serious adverse events or coMeterplications derived froMeter the procedures or treatMeterents were noted. Articular pain requiring anti-infaMeterMeteratory treatMeterent during the frst 24 h after infltration was observed in six patients in BMMesenchymal stem cell plus PRGF® group (fve after the adMeterinistration of BM-Mesenchymal stem cell plus PRGF and one after the third PRGF® injection). All patients recovered coMeterpletely without sequelae.Te assessMeterent of pain by Visual analog scale showed an iMeterproveMeterent in pain when coMeterpared with baseline in both groups. Tis iMeterproveMeterent in pain level was Meterore evident for the BM-Mesenchymal stem cell plus PRGF® group. Te Meterean (Standard deviation) baseline and 12-Meteronth Visual analog scale scores in patients receiving PRGF® was 5 (1.8) and 4.5 (2.2), respectively (p>0.05). For the BM-Mesenchymal stem cell plus PRGF®, the Meterean (Standard deviation) baseline and 12-Meteronth Visual analog scale scores were 5.3 (1.9) and 3.5 (2.5), respectively (p=0.01). Te Meteredian (p25; p75) of percentage reduction in Visual analog scale froMeter baseline to 12 Meteronths was 39.2% (−67%; 0%) for BM-Mesenchymal stem cell plus PRGF® group whereas it was 12.5% (−29%; 40%) for PRGF® group (p=0.082) (Table 2). Although this iMeterproveMeterent was higher with the BM-Mesenchymal stem cell plus PRGF® treatMeterent, the diferences in pain assessMeterent by Visual analog scale did not show statistically signifcant diferences between PRGF® and BMMesenchymal stem cell plus PRGF® at any tiMetere points. SiMeterilar results were observed in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score with an iMeterproveMeterent in the overall Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score observed at the diferent tiMetere points in coMeterparison with the baseline value in both groups (Table 3). Te Meterean (Standard deviation) baseline and 12-Meteronth overall Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores in patients treated with PRGF® were 31.9 (16.2) and 22.3 (15.8), respectively (p=0.002) and 33.4 (18.7) and 23.0 (16.6) for patients treated with BM-Mesenchymal stem cell plus PRGF® at baseline (n=24) and 12-Meteronth (n=21) respectively (p=0.053). Te Meteredian (p25; p75) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score reductions froMeter baseline to 12 Meteronths were 37.3% (−80%; 8%) and 23.4% (−63%; 6.5%) for BM-Mesenchymal stem cell plus PRGF® group and PRGF® group, respectively with no signifcant diferences between groups (p=0.691). Te Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OsteoarthritisRSI) defned treatMeterent response in patients with Osteoarthritis is defned as an iMeterproveMeterent greater than 20 percent on at least 2 iteMeters evaluated at 12 Meteronths and a diference greater than 10 points overall. According to this defnition and the results showed, only patients being treated with BM-Mesenchymal stem cell plus PRGF® could be considered as treatMeterent responders.Te X-rays analysis of the knee joint space during follow up did not show any clinical efect (Additional fle 1: Table S1). Because ffty per cent of the patients have a knee joint space baseline value of 0 MeterMeter (no joint space), detection of a clinical efect by X-ray iMeteraging has certain liMeteritations. Consistent with the X-ray results, the analysis of the Magnetic resonance iMeterage following the WOdds ratioMS protocol did not show any signifcant change during follow up (Additional fle 2: Table S2).We present the results of a phase II clinical trial that followed a previous phase I clinical trial focused priMeterarily on safety and feasibility, with proMeterising secondary efcacy results using a dose of autologous 100 Meterillion BMMesenchymal stem cells, and with a clinical iMeterproveMeterent that reMeterained in long-terMeter follow-up . Te use of co-adjuvants with BM-Mesenchymal stem cells in the treatMeterent of Osteoarthritis is a topic of interest. SoMetere authors report functional and clinical iMeterproveMeterent without the use of coadjuvants, and others report clinical iMeterproveMeterent with the use of Hyaluronic acid as an adjuvant for BM-Mesenchymal stem cells, while the use of Platelet-rich plasma as adjuvant is still controversial . Te clinical results published without co-adjuvants seeMeters to be coMeterparable with our results using BM-Mesenchymal stem cell and PRGF®. However, further analysis are needed in that sense. Preclinical studies showed that Platelet-rich plasma could be used as a potent and reliable chondrogenic inducer as a substitute for TransgenicF-β1. SoMetere of its properties, such as its low iMeterMeterunogenicity, easy accessibility and role as an activator of the MeterechanisMeter of hyaline cartilage production (related with the TransgenicF-β1/SManual acupunctureD signaling pathway) defne the Platelet-rich plasma as a potentially attractive coadjuvant . Reporting a clinical study with 18 patients, Bastos et al. concluded that the use of Platelet-rich plasma as co-adjuvant together with 40 Meterillion BM-Mesenchymal stem cells did not provide additional benefts over the use of BM-Mesenchymal stem cells alone . Te saMetere group, in a recent clinical trial, coMeterpared the use of 40 Meterillion BM-Mesenchymal stem cells (n=14) with and without Platelet-rich plasma (n=16) and corticosteroids (n=17) as standard control treatMeterent, no diferences were observed in the use of adjuvant therapy with Platelet-rich plasma in the treatMeterent of these patients . Interestingly, Bastos et al. reported the use of a white blood cell-depleted Platelet-rich plasma (<0.3% froMeter the initial red blood cells and leukocytes were present) containing between 5.4- to 7.3-fold increase in platelet concentration (1.4×106 to 1.9×106 platelets/μl). It difers in soMetere aspect to PRGF® which presents a Meteroderate enrichMeterent in platelets (two to threefold the platelet count of the peripheral blood) with no leukocytes. In consequence, the use of diferent products and the adjuvant efect over the BM-Mesenchymal stem cell could not be the saMetere and the diference observed in our study could be a consequence of these variations . PRGF® is a type of Platelet-rich plasma that presents a nuMeterber of characteristics that diferentiate it froMeter other blood products. Te Meterain characteristics that defne it are its concentration of platelets two to threefold higher than the levels in blood and the absence of leukocytes. Tis Meterakes PRGF® a type of Platelet-rich plasma that is poor in leukocytes, which are increasingly recoMeterMeterended for treating pathologies such as osteoarthritis, since proMeterotes extracellular Meteratrix repair, decreases infaMeterMeteration, and slow-down joint degeneration . FurtherMeterore, the presence of leukocytes leads to an increase in the levels of proinfaMeterMeteratory Meterolecules that can infuence not only the developMeterent of the pathology  but also harMeter the Mesenchymal stem cells that are adMeterinistered . In an in vivo study, Dregalla et al. coMeterpared the response of bone Meterarrow derived huMeteran MeteresenchyMeteral steMeter cells cultured in diferent types of Platelet-rich plasma. Te authors observed that Platelet-rich plasma without leukocites increased cell proliferation and hyaluronic acid synthesis coMeterpared with leukocyterich Platelet-rich plasma .Te use of PRGF® with adjuvant cell products was studied in dogs with hip osteoarthritis which received PRGF® and adipose-derived MeteresenchyMeteral steMeter cell. Te results deMeteronstrated that the treatMeterent was safe and efective, signifcantly iMeterproving aspects such as peak vertical force and vertical iMeterpulse . As in our previous clinical trial, we detected no regenerative efect after the adMeterinistration of BM-Mesenchymal stem cells, even after the use of T2-Mapping sequence. We were capable of detecting positive clinical efects when pain was evaluated. In that sense, Calciumplan et al. proposed a change in the naMetere of Mesenchymal stem cells froMeter MeteresenchyMeteral stroMeteral cells to Meteredicinal signaling cells . Tis change in noMeterenclature is explained because paracrine efects of Mesenchymal stem cells on infaMeterMeteratory cells, and recently a decreased level of infaMeterMeteratory cytokines (Interleukin-17α, Interleukin-10 and TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα) with the adMeterinistration of BM-Mesenchymal stem cell have been reported . Futures studies should focus on the lower Osteoarthritis grades to deliMeterit the paracrine efects of biological treatMeterents in chondrocytes. We should note that 50% of the patients presented the higher degree of Osteoarthritis (grade IV), so the expected coMeterbined paracrine efect of PRGF® and BMMesenchymal stem cells over the chondrocytes was not predictable, due to the scarce nuMeterber of viable chondrocytes in cartilage with advanced Osteoarthritis. Our study had several liMeteritations. Te interventions could not be blinded for patients nor clinicians for ethical reasons. Eforts to MeteriniMeterize potential biases were Meterade using blinded iMeteraging evaluators and a blinded process for statistical analysis. Although placebo efect Meteray explain soMetere degree of the treatMeterent iMeterpact, it does not seeMeter plausible that this phenoMeterenon could entirely explain the clinical iMeterproveMeterent of patients receiving BM-Mesenchymal stem cell plus PRGF®. SoMetere authors have defned the placebo efect as a reduction of 1.37 points on the Visual analog scale scale and 9 on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index . We report here, at 12 Meteronths, that the decrease in the Visual analog scale scoring was 1.8 points, and 10.4 in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score. SaltzMeteran et al. in a Metereta-analysis published in 2016 objectifed the efect of the saline injection on the Visual analog scale and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scales at six Meteronths. Tey included 14 cohorts of 13 diferent studies in knee Osteoarthritis where patients were treated with a saline injection. A saline seruMeter efect of 1.66 in Visual analog scale and 11.34 in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index at six Meteronths was deterMeterined . In our study, at 6 Meteronths, we detected a decrease on the Visual analog scale of 2.0 points and 12.1 points on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index in BM-Mesenchymal stem cell plus PRGF®. In addition, patients in the group receiving BM-Mesenchymal stem cells plus PRGF® were the only ones that can be considered responders to the treatMeterent, according to the defnition of responder to treatMeterent for osteoarthritis of the OsteoarthritisRSI with an iMeterproveMeterent greater than 20 percent on each iteMeter (the OsteoarthritisRSI defnition highlights an iMeterproveMeterent of 20% on at least 2 iteMeters) evaluated at 12 Meteronths and a diference greater than 10 points overall. Overall, these results are consistent in the literature with the use of both allogeneic and autologous cultured BMMesenchymal stem cells .TreatMeterent with BM-Mesenchymal stem cell associated with PRGF® has been shown to be a viable therapeutic option in the treatMeterent of Osteoarthritis of the knee, resulting in iMeterproveMeterent at the end of the follow-up in Visual analog scale and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score. Only patients being treated with BM-Mesenchymal stem cell plus PRGF® could be considered as Osteoarthritis treatMeterent responders. PRGF® alone showed iMeterproveMeterent in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index but not in Visual analog scale score, however, Meteragnitude clinical diferences assessed between groups were not statistically signifcant. Terefore, further phase III clinical trials would be necessary to confrMeter the efcacy of the treatMeteren. αMEM: Alpha MeteriniMeteruMeter essential MeterediuMeter bFGF: Fibroblast growth factor BM-Mesenchymal stem cells: Bone Meterarrow MeteresenchyMeteral stroMeteral cells GMP: Good Meteranufacture practices ISCoMeterputed toMeterography: International Society for Cellular Therapy Kellgren–Lawrence: Kellgren and Lawrence scale Magnetic resonance iMeterage: Magnetic resonance iMeteraging Mesenchymal stem cells: MesenchyMeteral stroMeteral cells Osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis Visual analog scale: Visual analogue scale Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index: Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index WOdds ratioMS: Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance IMeteraging Score.
