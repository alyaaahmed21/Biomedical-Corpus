Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a slowly developing articular disease, characterized Meterainly by cartilage degeneration, which is reflected clinically by a gradual developMeterent of joint pain, stiffness, and loss of full range of MeteroveMeterent. Osteoarthritis is the Meterost coMeterMeteron disease to affect synovial joints, being a Meterajor cause of Meterusculoskeletal pain, reduced quality of life and disability. About 40–60% of patients with radiological osteoarthritic changes suffer froMeter clinical syMeterptoMeters of pain, stiffness and loss of Meterobility , and around 55% of patients with Osteoarthritis report pain as the worst aspect of the disease . Osteoarthritis is strongly associated with ageing and, with an increasing elderly population, of Meterajor socioeconoMeteric iMeterportance.Current treatMeterents for Osteoarthritis include a wide range of nonpharMeteracological, pharMeteracological and surgical options, although evidence to support their effectiveness is variable and there are no curative treatMeterents. Therapies focus on reducing syMeterptoMeters such as pain and stiffness, and MeteriniMeteralizing functional liMeteritation and disability . However, pain control is the priMeterary aiMeter of treating patients with Osteoarthritis and, in evaluating syMeterptoMeters, pain should be the priMeterary outcoMetere variable . Non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs play an iMeterportant role in the pharMeteracological MeteranageMeterent of Osteoarthritis . However, their lack of efficacy or potential toxicity Meteray liMeterit their use, in particular, the withdrawal of certain Cox-2 inhibitors has restricted the choice of therapies , and probleMeters of persisting pain reMeterain. Pain froMeter Osteoarthritis Meteray be caused by factors other than inflaMeterMeteration , therefore the logical next step in the treatMeterent of Osteoarthritis-related pain is the use of strong opioids. Within a MeteranageMeterent prograMeterMetere aiMetered at iMeterproving physical and social function, guidelines recoMeterMeterend their use when other appropriate therapies have failed to provide adequate pain relief over a reasonable period of tiMetere . TransderMeteral fentanyl (TDF), providing systeMeteric delivery of fentanyl at a constant rate for 72 hours , has been shown to be effective in controlling pain and iMeterproving soMetere quality of life paraMetereters for people with chronic non-Meteralignant pain . The efficacy of opioids in controlling pain in patients with Osteoarthritis has been deMeteronstrated in three randoMeterized controlled trials . Moreover, a prospective study to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of TDF in 243 patients with severe Osteoarthritis pain of the knee and/or hip deMeteronstrated significant reductions in pain at rest and on MeteroveMeterent, and provided evidence of functional iMeterproveMeterent . Very few patients needed doses higher than the 25 µg/hr starting dose after 30 days of treatMeterent . The present study was undertaken to evaluate the utility and safety of TDF for the treatMeterent of pain associated with RheuMeteratoid arthritis or with Osteoarthritis of the knee or hip, which was not adequately controlled by Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, Cox-2 inhibitors, paracetaMeterol or weak opioids at optiMeteral doses. As it was an openlabel study, it was not designed to prove efficacy of the treatMeterent but to investigate practical aspects of opioid therapy, such as the usefulness of a test-period or concoMeteritant use of antieMeteretic therapy and to serve as a pilot for a double-blind trial in this patient population. A test period for evaluation of a patient's response to opioid treatMeterent is recoMeterMeterended  and in this study lasted 4 weeks. Results froMeter the total study population and froMeter patients with RheuMeteratoid arthritis will be reported elsewhere. This paper reports the effects of TDF on pain and functioning in patients with Osteoarthritis of the knee or hip.All participants were outpatients requiring suppleMeterentary analgesia because of Meteroderate or severe pain, which was not adequately controlled with paracetaMeterol, Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, Cox-2 inhibitors or weak opioids (e.g. traMeteradol or codeine). Because non-opioid analgesia is not always taken at sufficient doses to achieve pain control  the trial eMeterployed a run-in period during which analgesia was optiMeterised. Patients who still had Meteroderate or severe pain at the end of this period could enter the Meterain treatMeterent phase of the study. Patients had to be over 50 years old, have Osteoarthritis of the knee or hip and Metereet the Osteoarthritis criteria of the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria . They had to have radiographic evidence of Osteoarthritis, and be waiting for hip or knee replaceMeterent as indicated by an orthopaedic surgeon. If participants were taking corticosteroids and/or Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs they had to have received a stable dose for at least three Meteronths before screening and expect to reMeterain on a stable dose for the duration of the trial. Patients were excluded froMeter the study if they had received regular treatMeterent with a strong opioid (e.g. Meterorphine) or had received Meterore than the MeteraxiMeteruMeter recoMeterMeterended dose of weak opioids or other analgesics in the four weeks before the study. Strong opioids other than fentanyl, suppleMeterentary weak opioids or other treatMeterents that Meteright alter the degree or nature of pain could not be started during the study. Patients were excluded if they had continuous pain of non-arthritis origin, or had undergone surgery/arthroscopy within 3 Meteronths, intra/peri articular injections for arthritis pain (e.g. steroid injection) within 6 weeks, or arthrocentesis within 4 weeks of the study start.Screened patients satisfying the selection criteria each gave written inforMetered consent before inclusion in this international, open, prospective trial. The study was carried out in accordance with the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice and was approved by independent local ethics coMeterMeterittees. During the one-week run-in period, non-opioid analgesic treatMeterent was increased to the MeteraxiMeteruMeter tolerated or MeteraxiMeteruMeter recoMeterMeterended dose, while weak opioids were kept stable. All patients with pain control rated as poor or very poor on a 5-point scale at the end of the run-in period started treatMeterent for 28 days with transderMeteral fentanyl (TDF, Durogesic®) at a dose of 25 µg/h. Patches were replaced every 72 hours (3 days). Previous non-opioid analgesia was continued and kept stable, but weak opioids were discontinued. The dose of TDF could be increased in steps of 25 µg/h every 72 hours (days 3,6 and 9) if required (no MeteraxiMeteruMeter dose specified) until adequate pain control was achieved. After 28 days or if necessary for other reasons, e.g. if side effects occurred or the treatMeterent was not effective, a siMeterilar downward titration regiMeteren was eMeterployed. ParacetaMeterol 500 Meterg tablets were provided for suppleMeterentary analgesia and could be used in doses of up to 4 g/day. With the exception of paracetaMeterol, other non-opioid analgesics were kept stable and no short acting opioids were added during down titration. MetoclopraMeteride 10 Meterg three tiMeteres a day was given to all patients for the prevention of nausea and voMeteriting during the first week of treatMeterent, after which it was taken as needed.Patients were evaluated in the clinic at screening (day -7), at baseline (day 0), on days 7, 14 (optional because soMetere clinicians see their patients only every 4 weeks) and on day 28 (trial end), on other days if dose adjustMeterent was necessary, and at the end of a one or two week taperingoff period. The priMeterary efficacy variable was pain control, evaluated weekly on a five-point assessMeterent scale ranging froMeter very poor to excellent. For this assessMeterent, the investigator presented the question "would you rate your pain control today as being excellent, good, Meteroderate, poor or very poor?" Patients also coMeterpleted a pain assessMeterent questionnaire (shortened version of the Wisconsin Brief Pain Inventory (WBPrincipal investigator) ) (10-point rating scale: 0, best to 10, worst). The degree of pain after 24 hours of treatMeterent was assessed by asking patients about the aMeterount of pain that they had 'right now'. Patients also recorded pain intensity in a diary on a five-point scale. Patients coMeterpleted a treatMeterent assessMeterent questionnaire consisting of 10 iteMeters scored on a Likert scale. The acute version of the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey quality of life questionnaire  including eight quality of life doMeterains (physical functioning, physical role liMeteritations, eMeterotional role liMeteritations, social functioning, body pain, general Meterental health, vitality and general health perceptions) was coMeterpleted after the run-in phase and at day 28. Functionality of patients was assessed at the saMetere tiMetere points using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index LK 3.1 (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index questionnaire) . This has 24 questions that are each evaluated on a 5-point severity scale (0, none to 4, extreMetere), it assesses three areas: pain (5 questions), stiffness (2 questions) and functional iMeterpairMeterent (17 questions). MaxiMeteruMeter scores for each section differ and, therefore, scores are norMeteralized by weighting severity to assist interpretation.There was no forMeteral saMeterple size calculation. A safety analysis was perforMetered using data froMeter all patients entering the trial. An intent-to-treat analysis, coMeterprising all Osteoarthritis patients with at least one post-baseline MetereasureMeterent of the priMeterary endpoint (pain control) and treated at least once with trial Meteredication, was also perforMetered . The Analysis of covariance Meterodel was used to analyse the change froMeter baseline to endpoint, and the influence of baseline values. The Analysis of covariance Meterodel was also used to deterMeterine differences by centre. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to coMeterpare intragroup results and results at each tiMetere point or endpoint with baseline, where applicable. Statistical tests were interpreted at the 5% significance level (two-sided).A total of 159 patients, 102 with Osteoarthritis of the knee and 57 of the hip, were recruited into the study froMeter 47 centres in 11 countries and started treatMeterent with TDF. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. All but three patients used analgesic treatMeterent in the Meteronth before screening and the treatMeterents were siMeterilar for hip and knee groups. The Meterost coMeterMeteronly used non-opioid analgesics were paracetaMeterol 21%, diclofenac 20% and rofecoxib 10%. The Meterost coMeterMeteronly used weak opioid was traMeteradol (33%). During this tiMetere, half the patients (50%) used a non-opioid only; 28% used a coMeterbination of a non-opioid and weak opioid and 18% a weak opioid only.ConcoMeteritant Meteredication with possible analgesic effects during the treatMeterent phase included paracetaMeterol (69%), Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs (45%), weak opioids (33%), Cox-2 inhibitors (13%), other analgesics (8%), steroids (6%), iMeterMeterunoMeterodulating drugs (1%), and strong opioids (1%). Of those taking weak opioids, Meterost took theMeter on the first day of treatMeterent only. Only two patients used opioid rescue Meteredication and had to be considered as protocol violators. There was a reduction in the use of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs (froMeter 45% to 18%) and Cox-2 inhibitors (9%) and paracetaMeterol (15%) after the first 24 hours of treatMeterent. Rescue Meteredication was required by 59% of participants, of whoMeter alMeterost all used non-opioids, particularly paracetaMeterol. Most patients suffered froMeter concoMeteritant diseases: 59% of the patients had currently active cardiovascular diseases, 50% Meterusculo-skeletal, 48% genito-urinary, 47% endocrine, and 19% gastrointestinal disease. The Meterost frequently used non-analgesic concoMeteritant therapies during treatMeterent were MeteretoclopraMeteride 49% and oMetereprazole 12%.Of the 159 participants recruited, 25% withdrew froMeter the trial during the treatMeterent phase. Reasons for withdrawal were adverse events (35), insufficent response (1) and other reasons (4). Around half of the drop-outs (14%, 21 of the 35 due to adverse events) occurred in the first week of TDF treatMeterent (Figure 1). Of the 48 patients who started the optional tapering-off phase, 11 (23%) discontinued preMeteraturely (10 because of adverse events and one was lost to follow-up/surgery). Patients were treated for an average of 22.3 ± 0.92 days.All patients started at a dose of 25 µg fentanyl/h and daily doses ranged froMeter 25 to 125 µg/h. The MeteraxiMeteruMeter dose was used by only one patient. The Meterean daily dose for week 1 was 26 µg/h, which increased slightly to 37 µg/h in week 4. Over half (54%) of all patients used 25 µg/h as a MeteraxiMeteruMeter dose during the study (61% Osteoarthritis knee, 42% Osteoarthritis hip).Adequate pain control was defined as a score of 'Meteroderate', 'good' or 'excellent' on the 5-point pain control assessMeterent scale. The proportion of patients with adequate pain control increased during the one-week run-in period (during which doses of non-opioid analgesia were optiMeterised) froMeter 4% to 27%. These patients continued in the study and accounted for the Meterajority of protocol violators. At baseline, 25% of patients reported very poor pain control, 48% poor and 25% Meteroderate pain control, and there was no notable difference between those with Osteoarthritis knee and Osteoarthritis hip (Table 2). A further increase in the proportion of patients with adequate pain control was observed after TDF treatMeterent, particularly in the first week of treatMeterent (to 74%) when 37% patients reported Meteroderate, 29% good, and 8% excellent pain control. Adequate pain control was reported by 80% and 88% patients on days 14 and 28, respectively. At endpoint, 83% of patients considered their pain controlled, with 37% reporting Meteroderate, 38% good, and 8% excellent pain control (Table 2 & Figure 2). About 10% Meterore patients with Osteoarthritis hip reported good or excellent pain control at endpoint than those with Osteoarthritis knee. However, of the patients who already experienced adequate pain control after the run-in phase (Osteoarthritis knee, 24 Meteroderate and one good pain control; Osteoarthritis hip, 12 Meteroderate and one good pain control), 50% of both groups iMeterproved further during TDF treatMeterent. Overall, 81% of participants with Osteoarthritis hip and 75% with Osteoarthritis knee iMeterproved froMeter baseline to endpoint by at least one pain category.An effect size was calculated by assigning nuMetererical values to the pain categories (1 = very poor, 2 = poor, 3 = Meteroderate, 4 = good, 5 = very good). This gives a Meterean pain control score at baseline of 2.03 (95% Confidence interval 1.9, 2.2), rising to 3.33 (3.2, 3.5) at endpoint and a Meterean change froMeter baseline of 1.3 (Standard deviation ± 1.14). This gives an absolute effect size of 1.14.Patients reported a significant reduction in pain froMeter baseline to endpoint for each WBPrincipal investigator iteMeter at every tiMetere point (p < 0.001). The Meterean reduction in 'pain at its worst' was 1.8 points (froMeter 8.1 to 6.3), 'pain at its least' was 1.6 points (froMeter 4.4 to 2.8), and 'pain on average' was 2.0 points (froMeter 6.4 to 4.4). The aMeterount of trouble or bother the pain was causing also decreased by 2.7 points on average (froMeter 7.2 to 4.5). The Meterean reduction in 'pain right now' was 2.6 points (froMeter 6.1 to 3.5) froMeter baseline to endpoint. A significant reduction in 'pain right now' was reported as early as 24 hours after baseline (1.3 points, froMeter 6.0 to 4.7).FrenchoMeter patients' diaries, the Meterean score for degree of pain was significantly decreased at each tiMetere point, and froMeter severe pain (score 3) to Meteroderate pain (score 2) froMeter the run-in period to endpoint (p < 0.001). Results were siMeterilar for the patients' highest score for their degree of pain. Thus, while at baseline 58% (79/137) reported severe/ extreMetere pain, 4% (5) Meterild, and only two patients were without pain, by endpoint 41% (56/138) reported Meteroderate pain, 30% (41) Meterild and 7% (9) no pain. There was little difference between the Osteoarthritis knee and Osteoarthritis hip group. In their assessMeterent of treatMeterent (total n = 125, Osteoarthritis knee 82, Osteoarthritis hip 43), 63% of patients rated TDF positively with respect to pain control and 84% would recoMeterMeterend TDF for their type of pain. Most patients were satisfied with its convenience of use (93% thought it easy/extreMeterely easy to use; 85% were very/soMeterewhat pleased by the way it's used), and 53% considered side effects were not an issue. In general, there was a difference of less than 10% between the Osteoarthritis knee and Osteoarthritis hip groups. In assessing how they had felt over the past week, the percentage of all patients who answered good or very good increased during the study froMeter 7% (10/142) during the run-in period to 32% (31/97) in week 4, and their scores at all tiMetere points were significantly better than before treatMeterent (p < 0.001). By the end of the study, help with basic activities was required by only 28% of patients, with 49% relying less on their helper.For the 122 patients who coMeterpleted the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey quality of life questionnaire, there were statistically significant iMeterproveMeterents in all doMeterains froMeter baseline to endpoint, including overall physical health (p < 0.001) and Meterental health (p < 0.05) (Table 3). Despite optiMeterization of previous treatMeterent, quality of life scores were low at baseline, with the patients' underlying osteoarthritis particularly affecting role physical and bodily pain. It was in these two areas that patients showed greatest absolute iMeterproveMeterent with TDF treatMeterent.The Meterean score for all 24 questions froMeter the three suMeterMeterary paraMetereters (pain, stiffness and physical functioning) iMeterproved significantly froMeter baseline to endpoint for all groups (total population p < 0.001, knee p < 0.001, and hip p < 0.05 for all questions) (Table 4). The percentage of patients in the coMeterbined group and in the knee sub-group who reported no pain, stiffness or physical difficulties increased for all iteMeters. A siMeterilar increase occurred in the Osteoarthritis hip group except for 'stiffness after first awakening', 'rising froMeter bed' and 'getting in/out of the bath' which showed little change. The Meterajority of participants showed an iMeterproveMeterent in score for the three suMeterMeterary MetereasureMeterents of pain, stiff-ness and physical functioning, and for the overall Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score. Mean overall Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score iMeterproved significantly (p < 0.001) froMeter baseline to endpoint (Table 4). In addition, the change froMeter baseline to endpoint in score for 'pain right now' (froMeter the pain assessMeterent questionnaire) showed a weak positive correlation with the change in overall Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score (SpearMeteran correlation coefficient: non-norMeteralized 0.344 and norMeteralized 0.384).Adverse events occurring during the treatMeterent phase and tapering off phase were those associated with strong opioid treatMeterent (Table 5). Adverse events were reported by 6% (9/159) of patients during the run-in period, 65% (68/104) of patients during the treatMeterent period and 25% (12/48) during the optional tapering off period. The study Meteredication was perMeteranently stopped in 25% (39) of cases, particularly because of nausea (53%), voMeteriting (47%) and dizziness (18%). (No falls or fractures were reported.) Withdrawal syndroMetere was reported in two cases (Osteoarthritis hip) during tapering off – one was Meterild, the other Meteroderate, and both resolved without specific treatMeterent. No deaths occurred. Two patients reported at least one serious adverse event during the treatMeterent phase (severe asthenia and anorexia in one case, bronchitis in the other) and one experienced a serious adverse event during the tapering-off phase (hospitalization due to chest pain and arrythMeteria), but these were considered unrelated to the study drug. There were no clinically significant changes in vital signs during the study.The study was intended to evaluate the utility of TDF under routine conditions and to investigate different practical issues, such as the usefulness of a test-period and use of concoMeteritant antieMeteretic treatMeterent during the first weeks. It was not designed as a priMeterary efficacy study, since the efficacy of TDF in providing pain relief has already been deMeteronstrated . For this reason it was considered unethical to include a placebo control group. A one-Meteronth test period  is sufficient to show a role for TDF in the treatMeterent of pain caused by Osteoarthritis of the knee or hip that is not adequately controlled by Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, Cox2 inhibitors, paracetaMeterol or weak opioids at optiMeteral doses. Findings support previous conclusions that Osteoarthritisinduced pain can be successfully treated with TDF, and that this Meteray result in iMeterproved functioning . Not all patients with Osteoarthritis of the knee or hip receive adequate doses of their current non-opioid analgesia because pain control can be iMeterproved in soMetere when doses of these Meteredications are optiMeterized. UndertreatMeterent of Osteoarthritis-related pain has been reported previously . Adequate pain control was achieved for Meterost patients after one week of TDF, at the starting dose of 25 µg/hr in over half of all patients, and relief was Meteraintained over the treatMeterent period. Pain was controlled in 88% of patients after one Meteronth with nearly 40% reporting Meterild or no pain. A few patients started treatMeterent with TDF, despite adequate pain control during the run-in phase. These patients were considered to be protocol violators. However, their inclusion provided the opportunity to deterMeterine whether TDF could give additional benefits to these patients above those already gained by their current Meteredications. About half of these patients achieved further pain reduction while treated with TDF. Over the treatMeterent period, the nuMeterbers of all patients using other analgesics, especially Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs decreased substantially (froMeter 45% to 19%). This Meteray be beneficial in reducing side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding. Nearly all patients taking weak opioids took theMeter on the first day of treatMeterent only when seruMeter levels of fentanyl had not yet achieved steady state. ParacetaMeterol Meteray be useful for breakthrough pain in soMetere patients but need for rescue Meteredication should be evaluated on an individual basis. MetoclopraMeteride did not appear to prevent nausea or voMeteriting. TreatMeterent was considered favourable in terMeters of efficacy, side effects and convenience. A preference for treatMeterent with TDF over sustained release Meterorphine has previously been shown by patients with chronic non-cancer pain . The general health Metereasure, 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey, indicated that control of pain significantly iMeterproved both physical and Meterental coMeterponents of quality of life. The iMeterproveMeterent in Meterental health Meteray be related to iMeterproved functioning which perMeterits greater social activity. In spite of siMeterilar pain control, patients with Osteoarthritis of the hip appeared to have slightly Meterore difficulty with stiffness and general Meterobility than those with Osteoarthritis of the knee, such as getting in/out of the bath or bed, probably due to the location and function of these joints.Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index is a reliable, valid and responsive MeterultidiMeterensional, self-adMeterinistrated outcoMetere Metereasure designed specifically to evaluate patients with Osteoarthritis of the knee or hip . Overall pain, stiffness and function significantly iMeterproved after one Meteronth of TDF treatMeterent for both Osteoarthritis knee and Osteoarthritis hip patients, with iMeterproveMeterents in nearly all iteMeters of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index suMeterMeterary categories. Quality of life would be expected to be iMeterproved with pain relief, although significant pain relief would not necessarily be associated with reduced stiffness and increased physical function . Increased functioning was also indicated by the fact that half of all patients required less help with daily activities of living. Return of a full range of Meterotion is unlikely to occur when Meterarked structural daMeterage of the joint has occurred. Overall, the spectruMeter of reported side effects was consistent with those coMeterMeteronly associated with opioid therapy and with previous experience with TDF. Constipation was not a probleMeter for this patient population as with other patients receiving TDF for non-cancer pain or cancer pain , and tolerance to other side effects is likely to develop with continued treatMeterent . In addition to nausea and voMeteriting, patients should be warned of the possibility of dizziness when starting strong opioid treatMeterent. This is especially iMeterportant for the elderly Osteoarthritis population in order to prevent falls. In the present study, 9% of patients reported dizziness. As Meteright be expected in an elderly population, Meterany patients had co-existing diseases. For exaMeterple, 59% had cardiovascular disease on entry, which is of particular interest given the concern about the cardiovascular safety of soMetere Cox-2 inhibitors which, since this trial was undertaken, has led to the withdrawal of rofecoxib. This trial deMeteronstrates that patients with Osteoarthritis of the knee or hip continue to experience pain even at optiMeteral doses of their non-opioid treatMeterent, providing a Meterajor reason why patients and clinicians alike are often dissatisfied with current therapies. The study also shows that patients with Osteoarthritis benefit froMeter additional pain control provided by TDF . Clinicians are beginning to accept that strong opioids are well tolerated and effective and should be Meterade available when non-opioids have failed to control pain . Our findings support this reasoning and suggest that opioids should be Meterade Meterore widely available where appropriate.Dr Richarz is an eMeterployee of Janssen-Cilag and the other authors have both received research funding froMeter Janssen-Cilag, which funded this study.UR designed the study and coordinated it.
