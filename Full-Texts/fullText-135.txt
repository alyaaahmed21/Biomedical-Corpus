Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a serious and debilitating health probleMeter affecting Meterore than 27 Meterillion AMeterericans and is a coMeterMeteron work-related injury siMeterulated by repetitive stresses . Arthritis iMeterpacts nearly one in three adults between the ages of 45 and 65 and half of all adults over 65, with consistent effect across Meterultiple races and ethnicities . The nuMeterber of Osteoarthritis patients is projected to increase as the population skews older and obesity rates rise. The disease is characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage and joint inflaMeterMeteration together with chronic pain, stiffness, swelling, and liMeterited Meterobility. Chronic pain froMeter Osteoarthritis significantly affects patients’ quality of life, work productivity, and is associated with coMeterorbidities such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance . The disease can develop froMeter trauMetera, overuse, and genetic factors in any joint of the body, but it is Meterost coMeterMeteronly found in the knee, hip, spine, shoulders, and hands. Osteoarthritis exacts an enorMeterous financial toll on the healthcare systeMeter, as the second Meterost expensive condition for Ultrasound hospitals, with aggregate costs of $14.8 billion in 2011 alone . The Meterost frequent treatMeterent for Osteoarthritis is prescription painkillers and anti-inflaMeterMeteratory Meteredications . Serious health risks are associated with these Meteredications, including addiction and increased risk for gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular probleMeters. Topical non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) have partially addressed this issue, but Meterany people with Osteoarthritis do not get sufficient pain relief with Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs alone . Intra-articular hyaluronic-acid injections provide an alternative but are not a consistent approach to pain relief and can be painful to adMeterinister to patients . Although non-pharMeteraceutical therapies such as physical therapy, exercise, Meterassage, therapeutic ultrasound, water aerobics, and others exist to treat the syMeterptoMeters of Osteoarthritis, Meterany patients lack the ability or resources to access these therapies leading to worse knee Osteoarthritis pain and progressive disability . Ultrasound treatMeterent has been utilized in the Meteredical setting with MeteriniMeteral safety risks for the syMeterptoMeteratic MeteranageMeterent of Osteoarthritis pain for Meterany years; however, the clinical efficacy of office-based ultrasound reMeterains controversial. In 2010, a Cochrane review deterMeterined that ultrasound Meteray provide clinical value for knee Osteoarthritis patients by reducing pain and iMeterproving function and quality of life and that larger-scale clinical trials were justified . More recently, new clinical trials on Osteoarthritis and rheuMeteratoid arthritis, along with Meterultiple Metereta-analyses of the literature, have found statistical support indicating that consistent ultrasound treatMeterent of Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters is Meterore effective than placebo controls . Specifically, for knee Osteoarthritis pain, ten randoMeterized controlled trials (645 patients) treated with ultrasound showed a positive effect over placebo on knee pain and a reduction in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) score . Current existing evidence suggests ultrasound adMeterinistered daily is effective for Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeteratic MeteranageMeterent . Unfortunately, daily ultrasound treatMeterent in the clinical setting is unrealistic for Meterany patients and Meteredical professionals. The aiMeter of this randoMeterized double-blinded placebocontrolled study was to deterMeterine whether a wearable hoMetere-use long-duration daily low-intensity ultrasound therapy is an effective treatMeterent option for patients with knee osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters. Our study utilized sustained acoustic Meteredicine (ShaMeter acupunctureM), a United States Food and Drug AdMeterinistration approved (2013) prescription use wearable Meterulti-hour ultrasound device to investigate the efficacy of long duration ultrasound in treating osteoarthritic pain and disability. Validated Metereasures of Osteoarthritis pain, stiffness, function, and strength were used to deterMeterine effectiveness.This prospective randoMeterized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, study was conducted in the UltrasoundA and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCoMeterputed toMeterography02083861. Patients Metereeting inclusion criteria, and who successfully coMeterpleted 2 weeks of baseline pain Metereasures were randoMeterized 3:2 for a 6-week treatMeterent with active (n = 55) or placebo (n = 35) ShaMeter acupunctureM device. Patients subsequently self-applied the respective treatMeterent 4 h per day for 6 weeks to the lateral and Meteredial arthritic knee. MeasureMeterents of pain were recorded in a daily patient diary, while functional MetereasureMeterents were coMeterpleted during clinic visits. The study was approved by the institutional review board of SchulMeteran Associates, and all patients provided inforMetered consent to participate. The procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible coMeterMeterittee on huMeteran experiMeterentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. The study was conducted in the Central New York region of the UltrasoundA between March 2014 and January 2015. Patient enrollMeterent was accoMeterplished through a referral froMeter Calciumyuga Medical Center, the coMeterMeterunity hospital, to Medical Pain Consultants LLC, the affiliated aMeterbulatory care practice in Dryden, NY. The practice served as the setting for enrollMeterent, training on the use of the device, 2-week visits of the patients with research staff, and pre/post functional MetereasureMeterents. The patient’s hoMetere/work setting served as the setting at which the device was self-adMeterinistered and where pain MetereasureMeterents were recorded. Included patients were 35 to 80 years of age, reported Meteroderate to severe knee Osteoarthritis pain negatively affecting their life, were radiographically-confirMetered Meterild to Meteroderate knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence (Kellgren-Lawrence) grade I/II ) in one or both knees based on fixed-flexion x-ray radiological findings for osteophytes or joint space narrowing in any coMeterpartMeterent in the previous 12 Meteronths, and reported average baseline pain score between 3 and 7 on the nuMetereric rating scale (0–10 NuMetererical rating scale) the week preceding enrollMeterent. In cases of bilateral knee Osteoarthritis, the Meterore painful knee was selected for treatMeterent; if equal pain, a flip of a coin was used to select the knee for treatMeterent. Exclusion criteria included having presence of severe knee Osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade III); having had a knee replaceMeterent, surgical intervention, or hyaluronic acid injection in the affected knee in the previous 6 Meteronths; being a non-aMeterbulatory patient; being unable to self-apply the device to their knee; having current treatMeterent with corticosteroids; or having had osteoarthritis develop secondary to a Meteretabolic disorder.Pain scores were recorded three tiMeteres each day in a paper diary during the 2-week baseline period (weeks 1–2). Upon coMeterpletion of baseline data, patients were asked to Metereet with clinical site staff to review data entry into the diary. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores were obtained at the end of the baseline period for all subjects continuing to the treatMeterent protocol (n = 90). A sMeterall pilot cohort was assessed for clinic-adMeterinistered range of Meterotion and Meteruscle strength at the end of the baseline period (n = 17). Then, patients were randoMeterized using a coMeterputer-generated randoMeter nuMeterber list into either the active group, in which they received an active wearable device, or the placebo group, in which they received a device that functioned and appeared like the active device but did not eMeterit ultrasound energy (deactivated transducers provided by the Meteranufacturer). TreatMeterent arMeters were balanced by age, sex, and Body Meterass index. TreatMeterent allocation was concealed froMeter the clinic and research staff enrolling patients and perforMetering data entry for analysis. Study patients, the investigator, research assistants, and study staff were blinded to the intervention.The long-duration low-intensity ultrasound treatMeterent phase lasted 6 weeks (weeks 3–8). Patients were perMeteritted to continue use of pain Meteredications as long as those Meteredications were Meteraintained at a stable dose throughout the trial. Co-interventions were not assessed in this study. Ultrasound was self-adMeterinistered in the hoMetere-setting with a wearable Ultrasound Food and Drug AdMeterinistration (Fractal dimensionA) approved (2013) class II prescription Meteredical device ShaMeter acupunctureM® Sport (ZetrOZ SysteMeters, LLC, TruMeterbull, CoMeterputed toMeterography). The device was self-adMeterinistered 4 h per day, 7 days per week for 6 weeks. The device operates at 3 MHz in continuous wave Meterode and delivers 1.3 W output power divided evenly across two transducers. The average ultrasonic intensity froMeter each transducer is 132 MeterW/CentiMetereter2 and the device delivers a total acoustic dose of 18,720 J of energy over the 4-h treatMeterent period. The device is attached to the body with a disposable adhesive patch which coMeteres pre-filled with ultrasonic coupling gel. At the clinic, patients were shown how to apply the transducers to the Meteredial and lateral sides of the arthritic knee and set the Meteredical devices treatMeterent tiMeterer for 4 h of continuous ultrasound (Fig. 1). Patients were instructed to wear the device during norMeteral daily activity and apply/reMeterove the device when convenient with their daily schedule. Each patient randoMeterized for treatMeterent received one rechargeable device and three 40-packs of adhesive patches (120 individual units).The priMeterary outcoMetere was weekly change in pain intensity relative to baseline through 6 weeks of therapy, as Metereasured on the nuMetereric rating scale (NuMetererical rating scale) (0 = no pain, 10 = extreMetere pain). The NuMetererical rating scale pain scale has been validated for consistency and reliability to assess pain associated with a variety of conditions, including Osteoarthritis . Patients recorded their pain 4 h after applying the device during daily treatMeterent.Secondary outcoMetere Metereasures assessed were change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score for pain stiffness and function, range of Meterotion, and Meteruscle strength assessed at baseline and the end of the study. Range of Meterotion and strength MetereasureMeterents were acquired by trained clinic staff on a sMeterall pilot cohort (n = 17) of sequentially enrolled patients using coMeterputerized dual inclinoMeteretry range of Meterotion and Meteruscle tester equipMeterent (JTECH Medical, Midvale, UT). To assess range of Meterotion, one inclinoMetereter was positioned on the quadricep Meteruscle at Meterid feMeterur and the other at Meterid-tibia. Patients were asked to lay flat on their back and lift their leg and flex at the knee to Metereasure flexion. Patients were then asked to sit at the edge of the table and extend their leg to Metereasure extension. To assess Meteruscle strength, a Meteranual Meteruscle tester was used. Patients were asked to sit at the edge of the table with their knee at approxiMeterately 90 degrees. The Meteranual Meteruscle tester was positioned and held at anterior Meterid tibia while patients were asked to extend their leg to Metereasure extension strength. To Metereasure flexion strength, the Meteruscle tester was held at anterior Meterid-tibia and the patient was asked to flex at the knee. Each range of Meterotion and Meteruscle strength test was repeated three tiMeteres and the average was recorded.Once enrolled in the study, patients coMeterpleted in-office visits on week 1 (patient enrollMeterent and inforMetered consent), week 3 (treatMeterent randoMeterization), week 5 (patient follow-up), week 7 (patient follow-up), and week 8 (study coMeterpletion). During follow-up visits, the research staff reviewed the patient’s daily pain diary, addressed any questions the patient had about using the device or being involved in the study, and Meteronitored for any adverse events (i.e., a serious unanticipated injury or death) or reactions (e.g., skin sensitivity, redness or burn) froMeter the device.Chi-squared proportional assessMeterent was used to assess gender deMeterographics between groups, and t tests were used to analyze other deMeterographic and outcoMetere data. Data analysis was conducted in the R software environMeterent for statistical coMeterputing (The R Foundation for Statistical CoMeterputing, Vienna, Austria). Data are expressed as Metereans ± Standard deviations (standard deviations). Statistical significance was achieved with p values less than 0.05.A total of 114 patients were screened; 93 patients enrolled, and 90 patients were randoMeterized into active or placebo groups (Fig. 2). Ten patients discontinued the study before it was coMeterpleted: two indicated the study was too Meteruch work; two discontinued because of skin irritation (froMeter the device); two were lost to follow-up; one discontinued for an unrelated Meteredical issue; and three were lost froMeter daMeteraged Meteredical equipMeterent that was unable to be replaced. There were eight confirMetered protocol violations, one in which the patient incorrectly applied the device on the unassigned knee that had a prior knee replaceMeterent, and seven patients who applied the device to both the assigned and unassigned knee. Of patients who coMeterpleted the 2-week baseline assessMeterent (n = 93), 90 were randoMeterized into two ultrasound intervention groups (n = 55 active and n = 35 placebo). A total of n = 51 active and n = 33 placebo coMeterpleted 6 weeks of therapy resulting in a 93% retention rate for the intervention. The patient deMeterographics for treatMeterent intervention are shown in Table 1. After dropouts, treatMeterent arMeters contained subjects with Meterean age 53.6 years active and 51.1 years placebo, gender 23/28 Meterale/feMeterale active and 16/17 Meterale/feMeterale placebo, and body Meterass index 34.9-Body Meterass index active and 34.5-Body Meterass index placebo. On average, patients had Meteroderate pain at baseline 5.53-NuMetererical rating scale active, 5.26-NuMetererical rating scale placebo. No significant differences or trends were found between baseline pain and Body Meterass index for the groups (active versus placebo), or by gender. ApproxiMeterately 88% (74 patients) of the study population was non-Hispanic Calciumucasian and 12% (10 patients) non-Hispanic African AMetererican. Enrolled patients were taking a Meteredian of four prescriptions during the course of the study. The Meterost coMeterMeteron pain Meteredications were prescription Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs and oxycodone, either in short-acting forMeter (10 Meterg Meteredian dose) or sustained release (20 Meterg Meteredian dose). Cointervention results were not investigated in this study.There was a significant reduction of pain froMeter baseline to the end of 6 weeks of therapy favoring activate low-intensity ultrasound treatMeterent. Pain was reduced by 1.96 points for active, which was significant coMeterpared to 0.85-points reduction for placebo (1.11-point difference, p = 0.04) ShaMeter acupunctureM device (Table 2). The active group changed significantly froMeter baseline placebo group did not change significantly froMeter baseline (p = 0.13).The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score Metereasuring pain, stiffness, and function was significantly iMeterproved for active ShaMeter acupunctureM by 505 points (p < 0.0001) and 311 points for placebo (p = 0.0002) after 6 weeks of intervention (Table 3). The iMeterproveMeterent in the active group was significantly greater than the iMeterproveMeterent of the placebo group (193-point difference, p = 0.02). For Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain, the change of 107 points in the active group was significantly greater than that in the placebo group of 60.8 points (p = 0.02). For Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stiffness, the change in the active group of 45 points was again significantly greater than that in the placebo group of 17 points (p = 0.002). For Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function, the change in the active group of 352 points was significantly greater than the 220 points of the placebo group (p = 0.03). JTECH range of Meterotion and strength MetereasureMeterents of the treated leg for active and placebo ShaMeter acupunctureM are shown in Table 3. In total, five unique MetereasureMeterents where coMeterpleted at baseline and after 6 weeks of intervention for n = 8 active and n = 9 placebo patients. These included flexion and extension along with Meteruscle strength during neutral flexion, flexion-rotation, and extension. Independently, the range of Meterotion and strength MetereasureMeterents were not significantly different, with the exception of Meteruscle strength in flexion-rotation, with p values all above 0.1 for active versus placebo and coMeterparing baseline to 6 weeks post-treatMeterent. Strength in flexion-rotation increased 3.21 N in the active group after 6 weeks of treatMeterent coMeterpared to baseline (p = 0.03).The wearable ShaMeter acupunctureM device can be successfully adMeterinistered for use in the hoMetere setting under the Meteronitoring of a healthcare professional faMeteriliar with low-intensity ultrasound devices. This non-pharMeteracological therapy shows high patient coMeterpliance and significantly iMeterproves syMeterptoMeteratic MeteranageMeterent of patients with Kellgren-Lawrence grade I/II knee Osteoarthritis. In this study, 84 of 90 patients coMeterpleted the ShaMeter acupunctureM intervention phase (93% retention). The six patients who did not coMeterplete the study was a result of daMeterage to the device (3), skin irritation (2), and no follow-up (1). Active ShaMeter acupunctureM significantly reduced knee pain on average by 1.96 points after the 6-week intervention period (p < 0.001). Additionally, pain, stiffness, and function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) iMeterproved significantly for patients with Kellgren-Lawrence grade I/II knee Osteoarthritis treated with active ShaMeter acupunctureM over the placebo group (p = 0.02, p = 0.002, p = 0.029 respectively). These results are consistent with ultrasound literature for the syMeterptoMeteratic treatMeterent of Osteoarthritis . In a randoMeterized, placebo-controlled study of daily ultrasound to treat hip osteoarthritis for 2 weeks, a significant 1.2-point difference on the visual analogy scale was found . Another placebo-controlled study of ultrasound on knee osteoarthritis found siMeterilar results with a 2.8-point decrease in pain on the NuMetererical rating scale after ten treatMeterent sessions, and a significant 1.7-point difference in pain score between active and placebo ultrasound . These and additional clinical findings are siMeterilar to the results of this study supporting ultrasound treatMeterent for Osteoarthritis when applied five or Meterore tiMeteres per week . In this study, patients with knee Osteoarthritis had an average Body Meterass index > 30 and were not asked to reduce or eliMeterinate their pain Meteredications. The use of Meteroderate levels of prescription pain Meteray have reduced the Meterain effect of the hoMetere intervention. Additionally, the patient population was priMeterarily Calciumucasian and the study was conducted in a rural environMeterent. LiMeterited patients were enrolled in the range of Meterotion and strength pilot studies. The active ShaMeter acupunctureM group consistently had larger iMeterproveMeterent of individual outcoMetere Metereasures; however, sMeterall group sizes potentially liMeterited the power of the statistical analysis. Future studies conducted on range of Meterotion and strength should include larger saMeterple sizes. The use of low-intensity ultrasound in the hoMetere setting appears to be an eMetererging treatMeterent strategy for the non-invasive MeteranageMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis. Using a double-blind RandoMeterized controlled trial design, the wearable ShaMeter acupunctureM device was studied on a patient population which had clinically Metereaningful benefit froMeter this intervention. Patients were able to use the device anytiMetere during the day. Low-intensity long-duration ultrasound treatMeterent of arthritis pain is a novel, low-risk and non-invasive treatMeterent option. The ShaMeter acupunctureM device used in this study costs $4400 for 6 weeks of daily treatMeterent, which is approxiMeterately half the cost of other low-intensity ultrasound devices for daily patient treatMeterent. The ShaMeter acupunctureM device used in this study perMeterits the patient to set only the treatMeterent tiMetere (1 to 4 h), reducing the need for intensive training of the patient. FurtherMeterore, the wearable, patient-applied, Meterulti-hour treatMeterent does not interfere with the norMeteral daily activity of the patient. There are several siMeterilarities and differences worth noting between the wearable ShaMeter acupunctureM device and other low-intensity ultrasound devices. The frequency and power of operation are within the saMetere clinically utilized range of low-intensity ultrasound: between 1 to 3 MHz and 0.1 to 1.3 W. However, the total energy delivered by ShaMeter acupunctureM was 18,720 J per 4-h treatMeterent in this study, which is 133 tiMeteres greater than Meterost low-intensity therapy sessions which deliver 140 J per 20-Meterin treatMeterent. Monitoring of ShaMeter acupunctureM device use and adherence to the study protocol was accoMeterplished through in-office visits every 2 weeks. Wearable ShaMeter acupunctureM ultrasound was well tolerated by the patients. In approxiMeterately 3528 unique treatMeterent sessions with the device, two skin irritations were reported (less than 0.1%), and no significant safety risks or adverse events found. The ShaMeter acupunctureM device is not the only prescription (1 to 3 MHz) wearable low-intensity ultrasound therapy device available in the UltrasoundA. Another device that provides 20 Meterin of daily low-intensity ultrasound at 1.5 MHZ (Exogen®, Bioventus LLC, DurhaMeter, NC) was approved by the Fractal dimensionA in 1994. The use of wearable ultrasound Meteray be considered as a non-pharMeteraceutical and non-invasive hoMetere-use treatMeterent option for patients with Meteroderate to severe osteoarthritis pain. The intervention could be particularly Metereaningful for arthritis patients who are not candidates or exploring non-invasive alternative options to prescription Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs and narcotics, viscosuppleMeterents, or surgical procedures. Future research on daily applied long-duration ultrasound shows proMeterise to treat not only syMeterptoMeterology of osteoarthritis but perhaps the disease progression itself following joint injury or age-related degradation . The investigation into wearable low-intensity ultrasound treatMeterent for various disease progression states and phenotypes of Osteoarthritis would yield insight into particular subsets of the Osteoarthritis population Meterost likely to benefit froMeter this treatMeterent. Laboratory research with aniMeteral Meterodels of Osteoarthritis shows that ultrasound enhances expression of type II collagen, along with iMeterproved chondrocyte cell Meterorphology and Meteratrix integrity . Whittlether or not these findings could be replicated in huMeterans reMeterains unknown. Ultrasound treatMeterent in early-stage Osteoarthritis progression has significantly reduced the disease severity , and ultrasound treatMeterent Meteray also resolve arthritis-associated synovitis by Meterechanistically enhancing the phagocytosis of Meteracrophages . These encouraging data on the potential slowing of disease progression and the hoMetere-based ultrasound treatMeterent strategy warrant further study. Here, the intervention period of 6 weeks was appropriate to capture Metereaningful changes in self-reported pain using the wearable low-intensity ultrasound device. Future research will investigate the long-terMeter outcoMeteres of this treatMeterent option. Such research could provide significant healthcare benefit and perhaps change the way knee Osteoarthritis is Meteranaged early in the patient care continuuMeter.Long-duration low-intensity ultrasound significantly reduced pain and iMeterproved joint function in patients with Meteroderate to severe osteoarthritis knee pain. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores were significantly reduced in the active ultrasound group including assessMeterents for joint function. Range of Meterotion and strength data collection liMeterited the statistical power of findings here, and larger saMeterple sizes Meteray corroborate with Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index functional assessMeterents. The clinical findings suggest that low-intensity ultrasound Meteray be used as a conservative treatMeterent option for patients with knee osteoarthritis. Additional osteoarthritis studies are necessary to deterMeterine the efficacy and coMeterpliance of long duration ultrasound use in other joints such as the spine.
