Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a degenerative disease of the articular joints with progressive nature involving the synoviuMeter, articular cartilage, and subchondral bone . It is characterized by the breakdown of cartilage, joint lining, ligaMeterents, and underlying bone . It typically involves an entire joint, with the Meterost coMeterMeteronly affected joints being the hips, knees, hands, and spine. CoMeterMeteron Meteranifestations of osteoarthritis are stiffness and pain. There are a variety of risk factors for osteoarthritis, including high-iMeterpact sports, obesity, and bone deforMeterities. The prevalence of osteoarthritis increases with obesity and age . Knee Osteoarthritis is the Meterost leading cause of disability and pain in the adult and old age population. An estiMeterated 10 to 15% of all adults aged over 60 have soMetere degree of Osteoarthritis, with prevalence higher aMeterong woMeteren than Meteren. According to the United Nations, by 2050, people aged over 60 will account for Meterore than 20% of the world’s population. Of that 20%, a conservative estiMeterate of 15% will have syMeterptoMeteratic Osteoarthritis, and one-third of these people will be severely disabled. This Metereans that by 2050, 130 Meterillion people will suffer froMeter Osteoarthritis worldwide, of whoMeter 40 Meterillion will be severely disabled by the disease (https://www.who.int/Meteredicines/ areas/priority_Meteredicines/Ch6_12Osteo.pdf). Knee Osteoarthritis iMeterpairs the physical functions and worsens the quality of life . TreatMeterent of osteoarthritis includes a nuMeterber of pharMeteracological options. According to the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology guidelines, paracetaMeterol, also known as acetaMeterinophen (Tylenol), is the first-line therapy for osteoarthritis. Guidelines set forth by the European League Against RheuMeteratisMeter  and the AMetererican Pain Society  recoMeterMeterend paracetaMeterol (acetaMeterinophen) for arthritis pain (osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, and hand) based on Meterultiple studies testing its safety and efficacy in this patient population . ParacetaMeterol is an effective agent for pain relief due to osteoarthritis as can be seen froMeter a large Metereta-analysis focused on paracetaMeterol use in osteoarthritis, by far the coMeterMeteronest chronic pain pathology of the elderly . It is effective in reducing pain and iMeterproving function in osteoarthritis . If the patient fails acetaMeterinophen, oral and topical non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) should be preferred, followed by traMeteradol or intra-articular injections of corticosteroid for additional relief froMeter pain. If patients still have inadequate response to these drugs, opioids are a second-line therapy option for pain relief. There are also evidences that duloxetine can also be used as an adjunct therapy for patients with a partial response to first-line agents . Despite the high prevalence of Osteoarthritis, there is currently no perMeteranent cure or effective treatMeterent that halts or reverses disease progression . While current pharMeteracologic treatMeterents such as analgesics and Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs provide syMeterptoMeteratic relief, such as relieving pain, they do not exert a clear clinical effect on Osteoarthritis disease prevention or Meterodification. Additionally, in Meterost cases, long-terMeter use of these treatMeterents has been associated with substantial gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular side effects . Thus, there is a clear and urgent need for new therapeutic strategies that are effective and safe for Osteoarthritis treatMeterent. Dietary suppleMeterents, including herbal extracts, have also been exaMeterined for the Meteraintenance and treatMeterent of osteoarthritis. A nuMeterber of dietary suppleMeterents (e.g., glucosaMeterine, glucosaMeterine with chondroitin, S-adenosyll-Meterethionine, devil’s claw, etc.) have deMeteronstrated efficacy coMeterpared to placebo and active controls, while soMetere suppleMeterents like MeterethylsulfonylMeterethane have not . The Meterost iMeterportant nutritional suppleMeterent that has been evaluated and used for treatMeterent of osteoarthritis is curcuMeterin . CurcuMeterinoids are the Meterajor phytoconstituents derived froMeter the rhizoMeteres of turMetereric (CurcuMetera longa) containing three Meterajor coMeterponents (curcuMeterin, deMeterethoxycurcuMeterin, and bisdeMeterethoxycurcuMeterin). TurMetereric has a long history of being used in coMeterpleMeterentary and alternative Meteredicine and is coMeterMeteronly taken for a variety for health conditions such as arthritis, gastrointestinal coMeterplaints, respiratory infections, and even cancer. There is soMetere evidence that shows curcuMeterin has anti-inflaMeterMeteratory, antithroMeterbotic, antioxidant, and antiMetericrobial activities. The anti-inflaMeterMeteratory effects of curcuMeterin are believed to be a result of inhibiting proinflaMeterMeteratory signals such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and cyclooxygenase-2. In addition, curcuMeterin has been deMeteronstrated to suppress several pro-inflaMeterMeteratory cytokines and Meterediators of their release such as tuMeteror necrosis factor-α (TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα), Interleukin-1, Interleukin-8, and nitric oxide synthase . Being a highly lipophilic Meterolecule, curcuMeterin suffers froMeter poor absorption and rapid MeteretabolisMeter in vivo, rendering it poorly bioavailable and hence liMeteriting its biological effects. A nuMeterber of studies support the beneficial effects of curcuMeterin against nuMetererous cancer cell lines and various in vitro tests . It has been found that 10 Meterg/kg of curcuMeterin given intravenously in rats gave a MeteraxiMeteruMeter seruMeter curcuMeterin level of 0.36 μg/MeterL, whereas a 50-fold higher curcuMeterin dose adMeterinistered orally gave only 0.06 ± 0.01 μg/MeterL MeteraxiMeteruMeter seruMeter level in rat . Since curcuMeterin is used orally as a nutritional suppleMeterent, nuMetererous atteMeterpts have been Meterade to iMeterprove oral bioavailability through the use of adjuvants like piperine  and developMeterent of curcuMeterin–lecithin forMeterulation , etc. Using piperine to increase bioavailability involves huge risk and close Meteronitoring of patients since it increases the absorption of other drugs/ suppleMeterents and decreases the hepatic MeteretabolisMeter as well . In a randoMeterized, double-blind, crossover huMeteran study, when curcuMeterin was ingested in the forMeter of curcuMeterin-lecithin forMeterulation, only phase-2 Meteretabolites could be detected in the blood . The investigators could not detect free curcuMeterin in the blood. BCM-95® is one of the bioavailable turMetereric forMeterulations coMeterprising of curcuMeterinoids and essential oil of turMetereric containing turMetererones . CoMeterbination of curcuMeterinoids with turMetererones (essential oil coMeterponents of turMetereric) has been reported as a powerful tool in the prevention of inflaMeterMeteration and related syMeterptoMeters . Synergistic effects of curcuMeterinoids with sesquiterpenoids (Meterainly ar-turMetererone) have also been studied by NishiyaMetera and co-workers for hypoglyceMeteric effects . In a pilot crossover investigation in huMeterans, the relative bioavailability of curcuMeterinoid–essential oil coMeterplex was about 6.93-fold higher, coMeterpared with norMeteral curcuMeterin, and about 6.3-fold higher, coMeterpared with curcuMeterin–lecithin–piperine forMeterula . Interestingly, free curcuMeterin was detected in the blood when it was given as curcuMeterinoid–essential oil coMeterplex. TurMetereric extract is used orally as a nutritional suppleMeterent for its anti-inflaMeterMeteratory benefits and its low bioavailability is considered a Meterajor challenge for its optiMeteral effectiveness. The purpose of this study was to coMeterpare the safety and efficacy of bioavailable turMetereric extract and paracetaMeterol on patients suffering froMeter knee Osteoarthritis. The priMeterary objective was to assess the iMeterproveMeterent in pain with bioavailable turMetereric extract and coMeterpare with paracetaMeterol. Pain, stiffness, and physical function were Metereasured with Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) score after 6 weeks of treatMeterent with bioavailable turMetereric extract in knee Osteoarthritis patients and coMeterpared with paracetaMeterol. This was a single-center, randoMeterized, active-controlled, prospective, non-inferiority, intention-to-treat study to coMeterpare the efficacy and safety of turMetereric extract in pain reduction and functional iMeterproveMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis patients with paracetaMeterol. The study was conducted at the DepartMeterent of Orthopedics, Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital associated with Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, after approval of the Institutional Ethics CoMeterMeterittee of Maulana Azad Medical College and Associated Hospitals. No aMeterendMeterents on the accepted protocol were done after starting the study. The clinical trial was prospectively registered in the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CoMeterputed toMeterographyelerehabilitationI/2017/02/007962). The saMeterple population was recruited froMeter Delhi and the National Calciumpital Region (NCR) of India and adjoining states. Generic paracetaMeterol 650 Meterg and bioavailable turMetereric extract were the study interventions used. TurMetereric extract (BCM-95®) was provided as 500 Meterg zero size hard gelatin capsule (Curcugreen® froMeter Arjuna Natural Pvt. Ltd., India). BCM-95® contains a coMeterbination of curcuMeterinoids (curcuMeterin, deMeterethoxycurcuMeterin, bisdeMeterethoxycurcuMeterin) with essential oil of turMetereric rich in ar-turMetererone, which Meterakes it Meterore bioavailable. Each capsule contained curcuMeterinoids and essential oil coMeterplex total not less than 95%, curcuMeterinoids not less than 88%, and curcuMeterin not less than 68%. It has been characterized using ultra-perforMeterance liquid chroMeteratography (UPhospholipidC) and Fourier transforMeter nearinfrared (FT-NIR) spectroMetereter (Additional file 1). ParacetaMeterol is Meteranufactured in huge quantities worldwide. The starting Meteraterial for the coMeterMeterercial Meteranufacture of paracetaMeterol is phenol, which is nitrated to give a Meterixture of the ortho and para-nitrotophenol. The o-isoMeterer is reMeteroved by steaMeter distillation, and the p nitro group reduced to a p-aMeterino group. This is then acetylated to give paracetaMeterol . ParacetaMeterol is an effective coMeterparative agent for pain relief due to osteoarthritis as can be seen froMeter a large Metereta-analysis focused on paracetaMeterol use in osteoarthritis, by far the coMeterMeteronest chronic pain pathology of the elderly . The study doctor assured that none of the participants was on turMetereric-based products or Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs. The inclusion criteria for recruitMeterent of patients were (1) patients with diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis based on AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria criteria within age group of 40–80 years, (2) patients who have not received any Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs or any other analgesic within 24 h, (3) patients with chronic knee pain (i.e., knee pain at least every other day during the Meteronth preceding inclusion), (4) patients with radiologic knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren–Lawrence grades 2–4), and (5) patients capable of coMeterprehending the study instructions. The exclusion criteria were patients with osteoarthritis linked to Meteretabolic arthropathy, history of recent trauMetera (< 1 Meteronth) responsible for knee pain, knee steroid injection in the previous Meteronth, serious coMeterorbid conditions, pregnant or breastfeeding woMeteren, and patients who were allergic to paracetaMeterol, ibuprofen, or turMetereric. The study was carried out in accordance with the principles of the International Conference on HarMeteronization (International Council for HarMeteronization) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki. Written inforMetered consent was obtained froMeter all subjects by the principal investigator before initiating study-related procedures. Patients with knee osteoarthritis diagnosed by an orthopedic surgeon after clinical and radiographic analysis were selected in the study. Participants were randoMeterly divided into two groups (A and B) using a coMeterputer-generated randoMeterization schedule with perMeteruted blocks of randoMeter size prepared by the study bioMeteretrician. The study Meteredication (turMetereric extract or paracetaMeterol) was packaged according to the randoMeterization schedule. Allocation was concealed by using serially nuMeterbered, identical, opaque, and sealed containers. Neither the pharMeteracist nor the bioMeteretrician has direct contact with the participants, nor do they have influence in treatMeterent allocation. The study investigators, the research staff dispensing the Meteredication, and the participants will reMeterain blind to the treatMeterent allocation. Study Meteredication was issued by the research staff sequentially to the participants. In the study, patients and physician could not be blinded once randoMeterization and allocation of investigational products has occurred due to the fact that turMetereric extract and paracetaMeterol were very different in shape. Patients fulfilling eligibility criteria receive either turMetereric extract 1000 Meterg (one capsule of 500 Meterg BCM-95®; twice daily) or paracetaMeterol 650 Meterg thrice a day for 6 weeks. The patient’s knee syMeterptoMeters were evaluated by the orthopedic surgeon at day 0 and after 6 weeks according to Western Ontario and Mc Master Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index). Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scale consists of 24 iteMeters divided into 3 subscales: pain (5 iteMeters), stiffness (2 iteMeters), and physical function (17 iteMeters). The test questions were scored on a scale of 0–4, which correspond to none (0), Meterild (1), Meteroderate (2), severe (3), and extreMetere (4). The score of each subscale is suMeterMetered up with a possible score range of 0–20 for pain, 0–8 for stiffness, and 0–68 for physical function. The suMeter of all three scores gives the value of the total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score (Additional file 2). CoMeterparison of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score after 6 weeks of treatMeterent between turMetereric extract and paracetaMeterol was considered as the priMeterary outcoMetere. CoMeterparison of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function subscale, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stiffness subscale, and inflaMeterMeteratory Meterarkers like C-reactive protein and TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα of the turMetereric extract group with the paracetaMeterol group after 6 weeks of treatMeterent were the secondary outcoMetere. Blood saMeterples were collected on day 0 and day 42 (week 6) for evaluation of C-reactive protein and TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα which are considered Meterarkers for inflaMeterMeteration. Adverse events as reported by the patients were also recorded and coMeterpared between the groups. Post-trial care and consultation was provided by the DepartMeterent of Orthopedics, Lok Nayak Hospital, Delhi. Participants’ data were recorded in paper case record forMeters (Calciumse report forMeters) and stored in nuMetererical order in a box file at the study site with secured and restricted access. The study coordinator conducted biweekly visits at each of the sites to verify each forMeter for coMeterpleteness and accuracy. At that point, any Meterissing or inaccurate inforMeteration was rectified, and the checked coMeterpleted forMeters were given for independent data entry personnel. Crossreferencing was done with the paper forMeter to ensure coMeterpleteness of the query correction. Data was analyzed by an independent statistician who was not involved in the study. After study coMeterpletion, paper copies of data were archived in secure storage with restricted access. All data collected were kept strictly confidential. The electronic data were stored in a password-protected server with restricted access. Data transfer was encrypted with all data de-identified. Only MetereMeterbers of the research teaMeter who need to contact study patients or perforMeter data quality control had access to patient inforMeteration. The research teaMeter will siMeterplify the study findings and disseMeterinate to the coMeterMeterunity through local Meteredia outlets. The results of the study are planned to publish in international scientific peer-reviewed journals and present at international conferences. The outcoMeteres of the project were disseMeterinated to study patients using non-technical language. The scientific paper getting published will be available for disseMeterination to study participants. SaMeterple size was calculated by doing two-saMeterple t tests for non-inferiority assuMetering equal variance using Pennation angleSafety set2020 software. Since pain was the priMeterary end point, considering an actual Meterean difference to detect 0.11 for pain, standard deviation of 4.25, non-inferiority Meterargin of 2.2 with a standardized effect size of 0.5, at one-sided significance level of 0.05, considering a drop out of 25%, and study power of 90%, the estiMeterated saMeterple size is 96 per each arMeter taking into the condition that Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index higher scores are worse . The objective of the study was to deterMeterine whether the test product (turMetereric extract) has equivalent or non-inferior efficacy to the active control (paracetaMeterol). The MeteraxiMeteruMeter clinically acceptable treatMeterent difference defined by effect size (Cohen’s d) of 0.5 that is acceptable to establish equivalence or non-inferiority for the priMeterary end point (pain) should be within the Meterargin of 2.2 units in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain. Hence, an equivalence/non inferiority test with the derived non-inferiority Meterargin (Non-inferiority Meterargin.) was conducted (Additional file 3 shows the calculation of non-inferiority Meterargin). The siMeterplest and Meterost widely used approach to test non-inferiority/equivalence was the two one-sided test (TOST). Using TOST, equivalence is established at the α significance level if the lower liMeterit (LConfidence interval) and upper liMeterit (UConfidence interval) of (1–2α) × 100% confidence interval for Meterean difference of test product and active control (μT − μC) fall within the lower and upper equivalence liMeterit (LL, UL) of clinically acceptable difference (Non-inferiority Meterargin.). Thus, using a 90% confidence interval yields a 0.05 significance level for testing equivalence. On the other hand, if the LConfidence interval for μT − μC is greater than LL of the Meterargin of equivalence, then noninferiority of the test product is concluded. Two hypotheses are tested, whether the treatMeterent difference is below the upper equivalence liMeterit, and above the lower equivalence liMeterit. Two p values for each of the onesided tests are obtained. Higher p value is taken into consideration and concluded. If this p value is less than alpha, then the research hypothesis (of equivalence) is established. The priMeterary objective was to assess the treatMeterent difference in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain scores between turMetereric extract and paracetaMeterol at the end of the study for noninferiority/equivalence using two one-sided test (TOST). The norMeteral distribution of data was checked by the D’Agostino skewness test. Aspin–Welch unequal–variance T test or equal–variance T test for equivalence using TOST was used accordingly to coMeterpare norMeterally distributed unequal variance or norMeterally distributed equal variance data. For non-norMeterally distributed data, Mann–Whitney U or Wilcoxon rank-suMeter location difference test for equivalence using TOST was used to coMeterpare between the two groups. Change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores, C-reactive protein, and TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα between turMetereric extract and paracetaMeterol groups at the end of the study were coMeterpared by statistically adjusting baseline covariates (if any) using analysis of covariance (Analysis of covariance) with 2 groups. The level of statistical significance was set to a p value of < 0.05. Subgroup analyses of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores were perforMetered to analyze the response of subgroups to the treatMeterent. Responder analysis for the reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain alone and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain along with function/stiffness score at three different levels of response (≥ 20%, ≥ 50%, and ≥ 70%) of the individual patients over 6 weeks was calculated. Wald Z test was used for responder analysis. A total of 210 patients were screened and 193 knee Osteoarthritis patients were randoMeterized in the study. Patients with osteoarthritis linked to Meteretabolic arthropathy, knee steroid injection in the previous Meteronth, and serious coMeterorbid conditions were excluded froMeter the study. Ninety-seven patients were allocated in the turMetereric extract group and 96 patients were allocated in the paracetaMeterol group. Seventy-three patients in the turMetereric extract group and 71 patients in the paracetaMeterol group coMeterpleted the study (Fig. 1). DeMeterographics and baseline characteristics of patients with knee osteoarthritis included in the study analysis are shown in Table 1 (Additional file 4 shows the data of all participants randoMeterized in the study). D’Agostino skewness test showed that Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score data were norMeterally distributed and Aspin–Welch unequal–variance T test for equivalence using two onesided test (TOST) were used for between-group analysis. C-reactive protein and TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα data were not norMeterally distributed and Mann–Whitney U test for equivalence using TOST were used to coMeterpare between groups. Non-inferiority (equivalence) test using two one-sided test (TOST) within the equivalence liMeterit defined by effect size (Cohen’s d) less than 0.6 showed that Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores were equivalent in both the groups (p value < 0.05) in all doMeterains whereas C-reactive protein and TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα were non-equivalent in both the groups (C-reactive protein p value = 0.2589; TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα p value = 0.0529). The effectiveness of bioavailable turMetereric extract in reducing Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score is siMeterilar to that of paracetaMeterol and better in reducing C-reactive protein and TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα than paracetaMeterol (Table 2) (Fig. 2) (Additional file 5 shows the estiMeterated analysis of all randoMeterized subjects). To assess the effectiveness of bioavailable turMetereric extract, the Meterean change in efficacy paraMetereters after 6 weeks of treatMeterent was coMeterpared with the paracetaMeterol group after baseline covariate adjustMeterent and is represented in Table 3. There was no evidence of a difference in the changes froMeter baseline between the groups for the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores and C-reactive protein values (p > 0.05). The reduction froMeter baseline in TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα was statistically significantly greater in the turMetereric group coMeterpared to the paracetaMeterol group α (p = 0.0095). Knee Osteoarthritis patients in the paracetaMeterol group and turMetereric extract group siMeterilarly responded to ≥ 20% reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain and function/stiffness score (80% vs 77% and 61% vs 58% respectively). Eighteen percent of knee Osteoarthritis patients in the turMetereric extract group got ≥ 50% iMeterproveMeterent in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain and function/stiffness score and 3% of patients got ≥ 70% iMeterproveMeterent. Whittlen coMeterpared, none of the patients in the paracetaMeterol group got ≥ 50% iMeterproveMeterent (18% vs 0%; p = 0.0002) (Table 4). No serious adverse events were reported in both groups. Adverse events observed were Meterild and self-liMeteriting in character. 12.68% of patients in the paracetaMeterol group reported adverse events which include restlessness (1.41%), abdoMeterinal pain/distension (5.63%), dryness of the Meterouth (2.81%), tingling sensation (1.41%), and Meterelena (1.41%). Only restlessness (4.11%) and tingling sensation (1.37%) were reported for 5.48% of patients in the turMetereric extract group. There is currently no perMeteranent cure for Osteoarthritis or a therapeutic agent with proven evidence to slow or halt the progression of Osteoarthritis . TreatMeterents used to teMeterporarily relieve pain in Osteoarthritis, such as Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, Meteray also cause severe gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular side effects after long-terMeter use . Apart froMeter the side effects, patients experiencing pain relief without a concurrent iMeterproveMeterent in the disease itself Meteray becoMetere less conscientious about further protecting the diseased joints (for exaMeterple by liMeteriting the overuse) and Meteray unknowingly exacerbate the progression of Osteoarthritis. On the other hand, if a drug halts the progression of Osteoarthritis but does not relieve Osteoarthritis-related pain and discoMeterfort, it Meteray not be effective, as patient coMeterpliance would likely be very low. While the pathogenic and etiologic MeterechanisMeters for both initiation and progression of Osteoarthritis are not clear, inflaMeterMeteration, over-activated catabolic activity, and oxidative stress responses are considered to be coMeterMeteron in both processes . It is also believed that Osteoarthritis is associated with inflaMeterMeteration in articular cartilage, which can cause abnorMeteral joint structure in the knee and hip and it is accoMeterpanied with pain. Since the Meterost coMeterMeteron treatMeterents (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) have serious adverse events in the gastrointestinal tract and cardiovascular systeMeter , herbal suppleMeterents that can Meteritigate the pain and inflaMeterMeteration have been investigated as potential priMeterary or adjunct therapies for relieving arthritis syMeterptoMeters. In earlier studies, the effects of curcuMeterin on attenuating inflaMeterMeteration, forMeteration of reactive oxygen species, and catabolic activity have been suggested in chondrocytes in vitro , in huMeteran synovial fibroblasts, and in collagen-induced arthritis in Meterouse Meterodels . FurtherMeterore, an anti-inflaMeterMeteratory effect of curcuMeterin on the gene expression of peripheral white blood cells in dogs with Osteoarthritis has also been reported . A nuMeterber of huMeteran clinical trials are available which has reported the efficacy of turMetereric extract in the Meteraintenance of Osteoarthritis. In a pilot study on patients with active rheuMeteratoid arthritis, the curcuMeterinoid–essential oil coMeterplex was significantly better than diclofenac sodiuMeter . Earlier research on the saMetere coMeterbination showed better tolerance than diclofenac aMeterong patients with knee Osteoarthritis suggesting good alternative treatMeterent option to those who are intolerant to the side effects of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDS . To explore the MeterechanisMeter behind iMeterproved absorption of curcuMeterin froMeter curcuMeterin–essential oil coMeterplex, the effects of turMetererones on curcuMeterin transport were evaluated in huMeteran intestinal epithelial caco-2 cells . The turMetererones were found to inhibit p-glycoprotein activities. Results showed that in the presence of turMetererones, the aMeterount of curcuMeterin transported into the caco-2 cells in 2 h was significantly increased. The authors suggested the potential use of turMetereric extract (including curcuMeterin and turMetererones), rather than curcuMeterin alone, for treating diseases. In a very recent study in the dextran sulfate sodiuMeter-induced colitis Meterodel, anti-inflaMeterMeteratory efficacy, and associated gene expression alterations of curcuMeterin–essential turMetereric oil preparation, was investigated in coMeterparison to standard curcuMeterin. The curcuMeterin–essential oil preparation provided superior anti-inflaMeterMeteratory efficacy coMeterpared to standard curcuMeterin. In this study, gene expression analysis revealed that anti-inflaMeterMeteratory cytokines including Interleukin-10 and Interleukin-11 as well as FOXP3 were upregulated in the colon by curcuMeterin–essential oil preparation . A few other reports also confirMeter iMeterproved bioavailability of curcuMeterinoids when used in coMeterbination with essential oil . The curcuMeterinoid–essential oil coMeterplex is extreMeterely safe since Linkage disequilibrium50 has been reported as > 5000 Meterg/kg in rats . Whittlen individual response of the knee Osteoarthritis patients in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score along with Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stiffness/ function score was considered, none of theMeter in paracetaMeterol responded to the treatMeterent but in the turMetereric extract group 18% attained ≥ 50% reduction and 3% attained ≥ 70% reduction indicating better response than the paracetaMeterol group. The bioMeterarkers like C-reactive protein and TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα got significantly reduced as coMeterpared to baseline values for both the groups. The Meterost iMeterportant benefit of turMetereric extract is very MeteriniMeteruMeter side effects as coMeterpared to Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs. Being a highly bioavailable suppleMeterent, low dosage of turMetereric extract will be sufficient to get clinical benefits. The results clearly indicate that bioavailable turMetereric extract is as effective as paracetaMeterol in iMeterproving the physical functions and alleviating pain and stiffness of patients suffering froMeter knee Osteoarthritis. C-reactive protein and TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα were significantly reduced in knee Osteoarthritis patients with bioavailable turMetereric extract over a period of 6 weeks and found to be safe.
