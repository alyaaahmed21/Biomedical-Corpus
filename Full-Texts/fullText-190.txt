With a rapidly ageing population, osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) has becoMetere the fastest growing cause of disability worldwide . Current estiMeterates suggest that over 250 Meterillion people across the globe are affected by Osteoarthritis, with a lifetiMetere risk for the developMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis of approxiMeterately 40% . Osteoarthritis is characterized by chronic joint pain and functional iMeterpairMeterent, resulting in Meterarkedly reduced quality of life for individuals. Osteoarthritis also places an enorMeterous burden on health services and health econoMeteries, and is the second leading cause of absence froMeter work . The cuMeterulative cost of Osteoarthritis has been estiMeterated to aMeterount to approxiMeterately 1% of gross national product . One of the Meterajor barriers to reducing the iMeterpact of Osteoarthritis, both on individuals and society, is the lack of efficacious therapies available to treat the syMeterptoMeters of Osteoarthritis or to slow the disease process and associated structural progression. Current MeteranageMeterent guidelines for Osteoarthritis include pharMeteracological therapies such as paracetaMeterol and Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, and non-pharMeteracological therapies including weight loss and exercise . Although current treatMeterents are aiMetered at providing syMeterptoMeteratic relief, recent studies suggest that the large Meterajority of people with Osteoarthritis live in constant pain despite use of available therapies . These therapies are also associated with significant toxicities. In addition, because the typical Osteoarthritis patient is of advanced age with Meterultiple coMeterorbidities, Meterany have contraindications to the use of traditional Osteoarthritis Meteredications. Hence, there is a pressing need to identify alternative therapies for Osteoarthritis in order to tackle this increasing probleMeter . There is increasing evidence, particularly froMeter iMeteraging studies, of a high prevalence of synovitis (inflaMeterMeteration of the synovial MetereMeterbrane) in Osteoarthritis, with abnorMeteralities present froMeter the earliest stages of the disease and associated with the presence and severity of pain . These changes are often indistinguishable to those observed in rheuMeteratoid arthritis (RheuMeteratoid arthritis), although they are generally confined to Meterore discrete regions within the joint, generally adjacent to sites of chondropathy. Increased levels of pro-inflaMeterMeteratory cytokines (such as tuMeterour necrosis factor (TuMeterour necrosis factor)α, interleukin (Interleukin)-1β and Interleukin-6), reduced levels of anti-inflaMeterMeteratory cytokines (such as Interleukin-10 and Interleukin-1RheuMeteratoid arthritis), infiltration of Meterononuclear cells and adaptive iMeterMeterune cell responses have all been deMeteronstrated within Osteoarthritis fluid and tissue, suggesting that Meterodulating the inflaMeterMeteratory response Meteray be effective as a treatMeterent target for Osteoarthritis . The rationale for targeting synovitis as a treatMeterent for Osteoarthritis pain is supported by previous studies of anti-inflaMeterMeteratory agents. RandoMeterized controlled trials of non-steroidal antiinflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) and the fewer randoMeterized controlled trials of intra-articular (Intra-articular) and oral corticosteroids have deMeteronstrated Meterodest, short-terMeter pain reduction associated with anti-inflaMeterMeteratory effects and reduced synovitis . However, although Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs and corticosteroids have positive short-terMeter effects their long-terMeter use is not desirable, with contra-indications to their use in Meterany people with Osteoarthritis. Disease Meterodifying anti-rheuMeteratic drugs (Diabetes mellitusanual acupunctureRDs) are the Meterainstay of treatMeterent for RheuMeteratoid arthritis and all have anti-synovial effects. Methotrexate ((Muscle thicknessX) 4-aMeterino-10-Meterethylfolic acid) is the first-line treatMeterent widely used to treat synovitis in the inflaMeterMeteratory arthritides, and current evidence suggests it is the Meterost effective Diabetes mellitusanual acupunctureRD and safe for long-terMeter use . Indications for the use of Muscle thicknessX have expanded in recent years to include trials to reduce cardiovascular disease (Calciumrdiovascular disease) in the general population, as well as showing reductions in Calciumrdiovascular disease in RheuMeteratoid arthritis patients . There is Meterore uncertainty about the benefits of Muscle thicknessX in other peripheral joint arthritides such as psoriatic arthritis (Psoriatic arthritis), however this Meteray reflect a lack of robust trial data . Muscle thicknessX is a folic acid antagonist which has both an antiproliferative and an anti-inflaMeterMeteratory action. The antiproliferative activity of Muscle thicknessX is Meterediated through inhibition of the de novo synthesis of purines and pyriMeteridines by acting as a specific antagonist of folic acid. Muscle thicknessX was initially used in high doses for its anti-proliferative effect in the treatMeterent of cancer, at doses of up to 5,000 Meterg per week. At Meteruch lower doses (15 to 25 Meterg per week), as used in inflaMeterMeteratory arthritis, Muscle thicknessX has an antiinflaMeterMeteratory effect by inducing an increase in adenosine release froMeter cells through selective inhibition of aMeterinoiMeteridazole carboxaMeteride ribonucleotide (Aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide) transforMeterylase, an enzyMetere that catalyses an interMeterediary step in de novo purine biosynthesis. Extracellular adenosine is a potent inhibitor of inflaMeterMeteration, suppressing the inflaMeterMeteratory functions of neutrophils, Meteracrophages and Meteronocytes, dendritic cells and lyMeterphocytes, thereby reducing secretion of inflaMeterMeteratory cytokines, including TuMeterour necrosis factorα and Interleukin-6, which drive synovitis . Given the high levels of pro-inflaMeterMeteratory cytokines and the evidence of iMeterMeterune cell infiltration into Osteoarthritis joints, coupled with the strong correlations observed between synovitis and pain, there is rationale for the use of Muscle thicknessX for reducing syMeterptoMeters in Osteoarthritis. Most patients tolerate Muscle thicknessX for long-terMeter use  and the use of folic acid concoMeteritantly with Muscle thicknessX reduces the incidence of side-effects . Patients undergo regular blood Meteronitoring to assess for toxicity, and abnorMeteralities in results usually respond to a dose reduction or teMeterporary cessation, or an increase in folic acid suppleMeterentation. Sideeffects of Muscle thicknessX can include gastrointestinal side-effects, haeMeteratological abnorMeteralities and elevated liver transaMeterinases. Side-effects resulting in discontinuation of the drug vary in frequency froMeter 15 to 17% , but have been shown to reduce to 4% in the second year of treatMeterent . To date there have been no large trials of Muscle thicknessX for treating Osteoarthritis. Two sMeterall studies, one in knee Osteoarthritis and the other in hand Osteoarthritis, have been carried out and these had conflicting results (Figure 1 and Table 1) . One additional study exaMeterined the effect of Muscle thicknessX in calciuMeter pyrophosphate crystal disease (CPer-protocolD) . However, these studies included very low patient nuMeterbers and sMeterall doses of Muscle thicknessX, which Meterakes it difficult to deterMeterine whether the results are valid. More recently, we conducted an open-label pilot study of 30 patients with knee Osteoarthritis who took Muscle thicknessX for six Meteronths . A total of 23 patients coMeterpleted the study, 20 of whoMeter were taking a Muscle thicknessX dose of 15 Meterg/week or Meterore. At six Meteronths, 50% of patients had a 20% reduction in pain, whilst 37% had a 40% reduction in pain. Of the seven participants who did not coMeterplete the study, four withdrew due to side effects (lethargy, nausea and headaches in three patients and thrush in one patient) and three withdrew due to lack of response. Further evidence for the potential of Muscle thicknessX as a therapy for Osteoarthritis can be extrapolated froMeter aniMeteral studies, with positive effects on cartilage deMeteronstrated in lapine Meterodels of Osteoarthritis . Taken together these clinical and experiMeterental studies suggest potential for Muscle thicknessX as a useful treatMeterent for Osteoarthritis. We propose that treating patients with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis with Muscle thicknessX will be a practical and safe treatMeterent to reduce synovitis and therefore reduce pain. We believe that the preliMeterinary data froMeter the handful of sMeterall studies previously conducted, including our pilot study, strongly support the need for a well-designed, adequately powered, randoMeterized placebo-controlled trial to exaMeterine fully the potential use of Muscle thicknessX as a treatMeterent for Osteoarthritis. The Pain Reduction with Oral Methotrexate in knee Osteoarthritis, a pragMeteratic phase III trial of TreatMeterent Effectiveness (Patient-reported outcoMetere MetereasureOTE) was designed to this end. This paper states the objective of the Patient-reported outcoMetere MetereasureOTE trial, discusses study design challenges encountered in its planning, and outlines the resultant study design and protocol for the Patient-reported outcoMetere MetereasureOTE trial.The priMeterary objective of the trial is to deterMeterine whether Muscle thicknessX reduces pain associated with knee Osteoarthritis as coMeterpared to placebo. Secondary objectives of the trial are: 1. To deterMeterine whether Muscle thicknessX iMeterproves function, 2. To deterMeterine whether Muscle thicknessX iMeterproves quality of life and 3. To deterMeterine whether Muscle thicknessX is a cost-effective treatMeterent for knee Osteoarthritis. In addition to the Meterain study, Patient-reported outcoMetere MetereasureOTE contains a Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage) substudy and a biological substudy. Patients enrolled in the Meterain study Meteray opt to enrol in one, both or neither of the sub-studies. The objective of the Magnetic resonance iMeterage substudy is to provide an explanatory MeterechanisMeter for associated syMeterptoMeter change by exaMeterining whether Muscle thicknessX reduces synovitis, and whether this is related to syMeterptoMeter change. The objective of the biological substudy is to deterMeterine whether baseline soluble iMeterMeterunological and inflaMeterMeteratory bioMeterarkers predict response to treatMeterent, and whether changes in levels occur following treatMeterent with Muscle thicknessX.The trial was designed with key stakeholders including rheuMeteratologists with experience of treating Osteoarthritis, general practitioners with a special interest in Meterusculoskeletal disease, Meterethodologists and users with experience of knee Osteoarthritis. The intention was to be pragMeteratic, allowing physicians to include Muscle thicknessX in the overall care of patients with knee Osteoarthritis and have relative flexibility in this regard, thereby being representative of clinical practice. We faced a nuMeterber of challenges in achieving the ideal design for the Patient-reported outcoMetere MetereasureOTE trial which are discussed in Meterore detail in the relevant sections below. Key challenges included defining the dosing and dose escalation strategy for use of Muscle thicknessX in Osteoarthritis patients, Meteraintaining the blind due to the well-known side-effect profile of Muscle thicknessX, tiMetering of the priMeterary outcoMetere, ensuring optiMeteral recruitMeterent for a trial that is conducted in secondary care for a condition where patients predoMeterinantly reside in priMeterary care and Meteraintaining the pragMeteratic nature of the trial with respect to concoMeteritant Meteredication use, whilst protecting the validity of the priMeterary pain outcoMetere.The Patient-reported outcoMetere MetereasureOTE trial is an investigator-initiated, Meterulticentre, 160 patient, randoMeterized placebo-controlled trial to coMeterpare the reduction in pain associated with knee Osteoarthritis with Muscle thicknessX as coMeterpared to placebo. Participants will be randoMeterized on a 1:1 basis to Muscle thicknessX or placebo, and treatMeterent will be for 12 Meteronths.All adults with syMeterptoMeteratic radiographic knee Osteoarthritis and inadequate response or toxicity to their existing Meteredication (to include paracetaMeterol, Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs or opioid).Participants will be randoMeterized to receive either overencapsulated Muscle thicknessX 2.5 Meterg tablets (packed with Metericrocrystalline cellulose (Sharp Clinical Services (UK) Ltd, Crickhowell, Wales)) or placebo (Meteratching capsules packed with Metericrocrystalline cellulose (Sharp Clinical Services (UK) Ltd, Crickhowell, Wales)).Muscle thicknessX is currently used in RheuMeteratoid arthritis with a MeteraxiMeteruMeter dose of 25 Meterg per week. Previous sMeterall studies in Osteoarthritis have used lower doses than those used in RheuMeteratoid arthritis ; however to alleviate concerns around inefficacy due to inadequate dosing, we will follow current guidelines for use of Muscle thicknessX in RheuMeteratoid arthritis as the Meterodel for the Patient-reported outcoMetere MetereasureOTE trial. Participants will be prescribed 10 Meterg Muscle thicknessX or placebo weekly for two weeks, followed by 15 Meterg weekly for two weeks, 20 Meterg weekly for two weeks and 25 Meterg weekly for the reMeterainder of the study if there is no toxicity as deterMeterined at the physician’s discretion . In practice, slower dose escalation Meteray be necessary in soMetere participants, and deviations froMeter this protocol (for exaMeterple escalation by 2.5 Meterg every two weeks) will be perMeteritted at the clinician’s discretion to bring participants to the MeteraxiMeteruMeter tolerated dose as closely in line with the stated strategy as possible. If participants show toxicity to Muscle thicknessX upon dose escalation the dose will be dropped to the MeteraxiMeteruMeter tolerated dose (MeteriniMeteruMeter dose, 7.5 Meterg/week) and this will be Meteraintained for the duration of the study. In our pilot study of Muscle thicknessX in Osteoarthritis, 20 of the 23 participants coMeterpleting the study did so on a dose of 15 Meterg or Meterore. Dose reduction (to 7.5 to 12.5 Meterg) was required in four participants; one due to renal iMeterpairMeterent and three due to side effects (nausea, headache and sore roof of Meterouth), all of which iMeterproved upon dose reduction. Participants who are intolerant of oral Muscle thicknessX will not be switched to subcutaneous Muscle thicknessX (a coMeterMeteron practice for RheuMeteratoid arthritis), due to coMeterplexities in Meteraintaining the blind. All participants will be routinely reMeterinded and encouraged to coMeterply with the prescribed dose of investigational Meteredicinal product (IMP). However, given the long half-life of Muscle thicknessX, those who Meteriss doses of IMP will be allowed to restart Meteredication if they so wish, and will not be handled differently during the course of followup. For the purposes of analysis, a participant Meterissing Meterore than four doses of Muscle thicknessX within any three-Meteronth period will be counted as a ‘non-coMeterplier’.All participants will be prescribed oral folic acid 5 Meterg tablets to be taken on the six consecutive days after taking the weekly Muscle thicknessX or placebo dose. Folic acid suppleMeterentation has been shown to aMetereliorate side effects associated with Muscle thicknessX’s activity as an antagonist of folic acid MeteretabolisMeter .In order to Meteraintain the pragMeteratic nature of the trial, there are no restrictions written into the protocol with regard to concoMeteritant analgesic Meteredications. All participants, whether on Muscle thicknessX or placebo, will be allowed to continue taking the treatMeterents for knee Osteoarthritis that they are taking at their screening visit for the duration of the trial. Investigators will be responsible for the overall MeteranageMeterent of a participant’s Meteredication, and will ask participants to avoid changing their analgesic or anti-inflaMeterMeteratory Meteredication for the duration of the trial. However, if a participant is experiencing increased pain and requires an increase in the dose of analgesics then the use of paracetaMeterol, topical or oral Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs or opioids, or a coMeterbination of these will be perMeteritted, but the reason for the dose increase and the dose used will be docuMeterented. The choice of Meteredications and doses to be used lie with the principal investigator and clinicians working at study sites in order to ensure that treatMeterent for participants in both groups is optiMeterized. Participants will be perMeteritted to continue current use of chondroitin and glucosaMeterine, provided the dose has been stable for three Meteronths at study entry; however their use Meterust be clearly docuMeterented in the case report forMeter (Calciumse report forMeterChondroitin or glucosaMeterine therapy will not be coMeterMeterenced during the duration of the trial. Chronic Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID and opioid use days in the last three Meteronths) will be included as a covariate in the analysis. The exception to this rule is corticosteroid use, since corticosteroids Meteray have a significant effect on a participant’s experience of pain, to the point of affecting response to the priMeterary outcoMetere. Whilst there will be no overall restriction on the use of corticosteroids, the protocol provides guidance to investigators on the use of corticosteroids in order to MeteriniMeterise effects on the priMeterary outcoMetere, as detailed below. Participants will be asked not to use corticosteroids (oral, intravenous, Intra-articular or intra-Meteruscular) between Meteronths three to six of the trial (three Meteronths before the priMeterary endpoint). In Meteronths zero to three and six to 12 a single Intra-articular corticosteroid (in a non-knee joint) and up to one week of oral corticosteroids will be perMeteritted. If corticosteroids are deeMetered necessary for Meteredical reasons then their date of use, dose, route and indication Meterust be clearly docuMeterented in the Calciumse report forMeter. Patients will be offered the option of a rescue Intra-articular corticosteroid injection to their signal knee after the six-Meteronth visit of the trial if their syMeterptoMeters are intolerable despite current Meteredication. Corticosteroid use is ultiMeterately at the discretion of the principal investigatoror study physician. All steroid use Meterust be notified to the Patient-reported outcoMetere MetereasureOTE trial teaMeter centrally, but this will not affect the participant’s continued follow-up in the trial.The Patient-reported outcoMetere MetereasureOTE trial will exaMeterine a range of clinical, iMeteraging and quality-of-life and econoMeteric outcoMeteres, in line with the objectives listed.The priMeterary endpoint of the study will be change in ‘average overall knee pain severity over the previous week’ (as graded on a zero to 10 nuMetererical rating scale (NuMetererical rating scale)) between baseline and six Meteronths (24 weeks). An NuMetererical rating scale was chosen to Metereasure pain as they have been found to be reliable and to deMeteronstrate good face and criterion validity, and they are recoMeterMeterended as a core outcoMetere Metereasure for chronic pain clinical trials by the Initiative on Methods, MeasureMeterent, and Pain AssessMeterent in Clinical Trials (IMeteratrix Meteretalloproteinaseennation angleCoMeterputed toMeterography) . The tiMetering of the priMeterary outcoMetere at six Meteronths was defined due to the slow-acting nature of Muscle thicknessX. Studies in RheuMeteratoid arthritis have found that several Meteronths of treatMeterent Meteray be required before any syMeterptoMeteratic effect is noted . Our own recent study of Muscle thicknessX versus Muscle thicknessX plus etanercept in RheuMeteratoid arthritis, in which the Muscle thicknessX arMeter used the saMetere dosing schedule as that planned for the Patient-reported outcoMetere MetereasureOTE trial, found that approxiMeterately 20% of participants in the Muscle thicknessX arMeter showed a Meterajor clinically significant response (tender and swollen joint count of zero) at three Meteronths, with this rising to 29% at six Meteronths and 33% at 12 Meteronths. In our pilot study of Muscle thicknessX in Osteoarthritis, the reduction in 48-hour pain Visual analog scale scores was significantly greater at 24 weeks (Meteredian (interquartile range (Interquartile range)) reduction of 27 MeterMeter (four to 38)) than at 12 weeks (Meteredian (Interquartile range) reduction of 9 MeterMeter (−1 to 36)).The dose escalation schedule for the Patient-reported outcoMetere MetereasureOTE trial requires a MeteriniMeteruMeter of six weeks to reach MeteraxiMeteruMeter dosage, and in reality we know that it can often take longer than this to escalate the dosage. Taken together with evidence froMeter the RheuMeteratoid arthritis literature, which suggests that at least two to three Meteronths Meteray be required at MeteraxiMeteral dose for syMeterptoMeteratic benefit to be achieved, a priMeterary outcoMetere earlier than six Meteronths Meteray fail to fully capture the clinical response to treatMeterent. However, additional outcoMeteres will be recorded at three Meteronths (12 weeks) to identify early response, and nine and 12 Meteronths (36 and 48 weeks) to capture longevity of response. Secondary outcoMetere Metereasures include self-reported assessMeterent of pain and function using 11-point NuMetererical rating scales to assess worst knee pain severity, global disease activity and satisfaction with knee function over the past week, together with the pain, function and stiffness subscales of the Western Ontario McMaster Universities Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index version 3.1) and the InterMeterittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain scale (ICOsteoarthritisP). Depression and anxiety will be assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). These Metereasures are outlined further in Table 2.Utility will be Metereasured using the EuroQol (EuroQol-5 DiMeterension-5 L), deriving quality-adjusted life years (Quality-adjusted life years) for each participant. Disease-specific quality-of-life Metereasures are listed in Table 2.GadoliniuMeter-enhanced 1.5/3.0 T Magnetic resonance iMeterage of the signal knee will be perforMetered at baseline and six Meteronths according to the protocol outlined in Table 3. All iMeterages will be quality controlled by an experienced Meterusculoskeletal radiologist within two weeks of acquisition to ensure that the iMeterage quality is sufficient for scoring purposes. Magnetic resonance iMeterages will be centrally scored seMeteri-quantitatively and quantitatively at the end of the study. SeMeteri-quantitative scoring will be conducted using the Magnetic resonance iMeterage Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOsteoarthritisKS) . IMeterages will be quantitatively scored using statistical shape Meterodelling technology to autoMeteratically quantitate total and coMeterpartMeterental synovial voluMetere, total and coMeterpartMeterental bone shape and other relevant features including cartilage Meterorphology .The standard deviation used in the saMeterple size calculation is an estiMeterate froMeter previous studies. The internal pilot study will be used to re-estiMeterate the saMeterple size required and increase the recruitMeterent target if necessary. A data-driven analysis which related change on an NuMetererical rating scale with patient global assessMeterent of change using data froMeter 10 siMeterilar trials of chronic pain showed that a 30% change, or two points on the NuMetererical rating scale was related to change of clinical iMeterportance in chronic pain. The correlation between clinician and patient global assessMeterent of change was high in this review, and the large saMeterple size used underscores the external validity of these estiMeterates . This estiMeterate of a two-point change on a NuMetererical rating scale being associated with a ‘Meteruch better’ iMeterproveMeterent was also seen in a prospective cohort of patients with chronic Meterusculoskeletal pain . In a recent placebo-controlled, 121 patient, Osteoarthritis knee trial using an 11-point pain NuMetererical rating scale as the priMeterary outcoMetere, the Meterean (standard deviation (Standard deviation)) baseline pain score was 6.1 (2.1) in the control group, 7.7 (1.4) in the placebo group, 7.1 (2.8) in treatMeterent group A and 6.7 (2.5) in treatMeterent group B . In a separate 73 patient Osteoarthritis knee trial, the Meterean (Standard deviation) baseline pain score was 4.0 (2.1) in group A and 4.3 (1.9) in group B. At 12 Meteronths, the Meterean (Standard deviation) within-group difference was 0.9 (2.1) for group A and 1.3 (2.4) for group B . For the saMeterple size calculation an Standard deviation of 4 is used as a conservative estiMeterate. The expected consistency in baseline pain aMeterong our trial population allows the use of raw change in score, rather than percentage change . In order to detect a two-point change, with an assuMetered Standard deviation of 4 (80% power and 5% significance level), 64 participants per arMeter are required. Allowing for a conservative 20% dropout rate,a total of 160 participants will therefore need to be recruited into the study. Ethical approval for the study has been granted by the Leeds West Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee (reference nuMeterber 13/YH/0279). InforMetered written consent will be obtained froMeter all participants. Since knee Osteoarthritis is priMeterarily Meteranaged within priMeterary care, our recruitMeterent strategy Meterust enable a clear interface between priMeterary care centres and the secondary care sites at which trial activity will take place. Relevant Clinical CoMeterMeterissioning Group (Clinical Commissioning Group) approvals will be obtained to enable priMeterary care sites to act as Patient Identification Centres (Principal investigatorCs), with potentially eligible patients referred on to local secondary care study teaMeters. A total of 160 subjects with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis will be recruited and randoMeterly allocated to either the treatMeterent or placebo control group. RecruitMeterent Meterethods will include advertiseMeterents through the local Meteredia and coMeterMeterunity groups, invitations to previous study participants who have given their consent to be contacted regarding future research projects and liaisons with Meterusculoskeletal physicians, general practitioners and allied health professionals. RecruitMeterent will be initiated at all sites as soon as local approvals are in place, therefore recruitMeterent to the pilot phase Meteray occur froMeter Meterultiple sites. There will be no pause in recruitMeterent once 30 patients are recruited, as the outcoMetere froMeter the analysis of the pilot phase will be to either continue to the planned nuMeterbers or to increase the planned saMeterple size.InforMetered consent will be obtained before patients are screened for participation in the Patient-reported outcoMetere MetereasureOTE trial. The right of the patient to refuse consent without giving reasons will be respected. Further, the patient will reMeterain free to withdraw froMeter the study at any tiMetere without giving reasons and without prejudicing any further treatMeterent. The written consent will be obtained by an appropriately delegated clinician who is, by education and experience, qualified to do so, and who has signed and dated the staff authorization and delegation log. The process of obtaining written consent will be clearly docuMeterented in the patient’s Meteredical notes. Patient confidentiality will be guaranteed at all tiMeteres, in line with the requireMeterents of the United KingdoMeter Data Protection Act 1998 and National Health Service regulations.Participants Meterust Metereet the inclusion and exclusion criteria (shown in Table 4) in order to participate. These will be assessed at the screening visit (Figure 2). Potential participants who are deeMetered ineligible at screening will be allowed a second screening visit if the reason for ineligibility is a teMeterporary status (for exaMeterple, recent corticosteroid injection; Table 4). Identical over-encapsulated Muscle thicknessX and placebo capsules will be produced to ensure allocation concealMeterent. Upon production, study Meteredication will be packed into bulk nuMeterbered bottles according to a randoMeterization schedule. This will be prepared by the contract Meteranufacturer using a coMeterputerized randoMeter nuMeterber generator, thereby guaranteeing full allocation concealMeterent. Study Meteredication will be issued in nuMetererical order by the pharMeteracy. Participants in each site will be randoMeterly assigned to the intervention arMeter or the placebo arMeter in a ratio of 1:1, and the randoMeterization will be double-blind.Investigators and participants will reMeterain blinded throughout the trial. EMeterergency unblinding will be allowed in liMeterited situations that iMeterpact on the safety of study participants. Code-break envelopes for the full randoMeterization schedule will be Meteraintained by the Leeds General InfirMeterary pharMeteracy, and pharMeteracies at other sites will hold code-break envelopes for their respective participants. A 24-hour code-break telephone line will also be established in case of the need for eMeterergency out-of-hours unblinding. Participants who are unblinded will be withdrawn froMeter treatMeterent but will continue to be followed as per the planned follow-up schedule, unless they request to fully withdraw froMeter the trial.Given the possible toxicities related to Muscle thicknessX, there is potential for investigators reviewing blood results to becoMetere aware of treatMeterent. Therefore, patient-reported outcoMeteres will be coMeterpleted before any changes in dose or results of blood Meteronitoring are discussed with participants. Whittlere possible, MetereMeterbers of staff with knowledge of blood results will not be responsible for adMeterinistering patient questionnaires.All data will be collected on standardized Calciumse report forMeters, which will be coMeterpleted by site staff, verified by the principal investigator, and returned to the clinical trials unit for data entry. Study sites will also return a patient nonidentifiable participant log and study drug dispensing log to the clinical trials unit.In addition to the patient-reported Metereasures of pain, function and quality-of-life and iMeteraging outcoMetere Metereasures described above and outlined in Table 2, a nuMeterber of additional data eleMeterents will be collected during the trial. At the baseline visit, Meteredical history and deMeterographic data, including sMeteroking and alcohol consuMeterption, eMeterployMeterent and faMeterily history of knee Osteoarthritis will be collected. Physical exaMeterination and vital signs, including height and weight, will be collected at screening, six and 12 Meteronths. A clinical exaMeterination of the knee will also be conducted at the baseline visit. This will assess effusion on a zero to three scale, where one is positive bulge sign, two is positive fluctuance (balloon sign) and three is tense effusion, and coMeterpartMeterental (Meteredial tibiofeMeteroral (Muscle thicknessF), lateral tibiofeMeteroral (LTibiofemoral) or patellofeMeteroral (Patellofemoral)) tenderness, also Metereasured on a zero to three scale. The specific tools used to capture each data eleMeterent are further detailed in Table 2.Adverse events will be recorded throughout the study. Intensity and relationship to the study Meteredication will be ascribed.Safety of therapy will be assessed according to regional Meteronitoring guidelines and will be deterMeterined by treatMeterent strategy. Full blood count (Full blood count), liver function test (Liver function test) and urea and electrolytes (Urea and electrolytes) tests will be perforMetered at screening, every two weeks for the first eight weeks, and every four weeks thereafter. If a patient’s results reMeterain abnorMeteral despite action (such as reducing their Muscle thicknessX dose), or at clinician discretion, then study Meteredication will be stopped. For the purposes of this study, abnorMeteral is defined as: haeMeteroglobin ≤8.5 g/dL; white cell count (White cell count) ≤3.5 × 109 /L; neutrophils ≤1.5 × 109 /L; platelets ≤100 × 109 /L; alanine aMeterinotransferase (Alanine aMeterinotransferase) > two tiMeteres the upper liMeterit of norMeteral (Upper limit of normal) for the laboratory conducting the test; creatinine >1.5 tiMeteres the Upper limit of normal for the laboratory conducting the test and estiMeterated gloMetererular filtration rate (Estimated glomerular filtration rate) <30 MeterL/Meterinute. C-reactive protein (C-reactive protein), anti-cyclic citrullinated protein (anti-Cyclic citrullinated protein) and rheuMeteratoid factor (RandoMeter forest) tests will be perforMetered at screening. Anti-Cyclic citrullinated protein and RandoMeter forest results froMeter the previous 12 Meteronths Meteray be used if these are available. A dipstick urinalysis will be perforMetered at screening to check for evidence of leucocytes, blood or protein, to exclude urine infection. A urine dipstick pregnancy test will be perforMetered for feMeterale participants with child-bearing potential, and appropriate contraceptive Meterethods docuMeterented for those at risk. All data obtained will be kept strictly confidential and will be stored electronically on a database with secured and restricted access. Datasets for each subject will be identified by the participant trial identification nuMeterber only. All participants have the right to withdraw consent at any tiMetere without prejudice. At the tiMetere of withdrawal of consent, a full efficacy and safety evaluation should be perforMetered if the participant consents. Participants who withdraw will be asked to coMeterplete the questionnaires as per the next planned study visit. At a participant’s request, their data collected up to the point of withdrawal can also be withdrawn froMeter the trial and will not be used in the final analysis. Participants who withdraw will return to routine care in the rheuMeteratology and Meterusculoskeletal out-patient clinics. In the event that a patient is unable to tolerate 7.5 Meterg of Muscle thicknessX, they will be withdrawn froMeter treatMeterent but will continue to be followed up on as per the planned follow-up schedule, unless they request to fully withdraw froMeter the trial.A centralized introduction and training session was held for all principal investigators and site staff. In addition to this, a site initiation visit will be held at all sites, in order to provide specific training to all staff involved in the study ahead of recruitMeterent. Pre-study training will be conducted to ensure robustness of Magnetic resonance iMeterage acquisition.The trial will be overseen and Meteronitored by the York Trials Unit on behalf of the Sponsor, the University of Leeds. Each site will be assessed prior to site setup, and visited again once the third participant is recruited or at 20 weeks after the start of recruitMeterent at site, whichever is sooner. The Patient-reported outcoMetere MetereasureOTE trial was assessed as low risk by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRheuMeteratoid arthritis), and therefore in addition to the single Meteronitoring visit, procedures for central Meteronitoring at the clinical trials unit have been put in place. This will Meterainly involve cross-checking logs returned froMeter the research teaMeter and site pharMeteracy for consistency. A data Meteronitoring and ethics coMeterMeterittee will provide independent oversight to ensure data quality and coMeterpliance with the trial protocol.Full details of the statistical Meterethods will be written in an approved statistical analysis plan prior to any data analysis.The priMeterary analysis will be conducted on the intentionto-treat population, including all randoMeterized participants in the groups to which they were randoMeterized. A per protocol population (excluding Meterajor protocol violations) will be used to check the robustness of the priMeterary analyses. The safety population will consist of all patients receiving at least one dose of the study drug. The first 30 participants (included in the internal pilot study) will be included in the Meterain trial analysis along with the rest of the participants. Wittes and Brittain show that saMeterple size re-estiMeteration using an internal pilot study has MeteriniMeteruMeter iMeterpact on the overall type I error, therefore an alpha level of 0.05 will still be used for the priMeterary analysis .The pilot phase analysis, which will be conducted after priMeterary outcoMetere data becoMeteres available for the thirtieth participant, will include the following: 1. AssessMeterent of the variability of the priMeterary outcoMetere Metereasure, the estiMeterate (Standard deviation) will be used to update the saMeterple size calculation; 2. Consent rate (out of the nuMeterber of inforMeteration packs sent out during the pilot phase); 3. Retention rates associated with each treatMeterent and 4. Return rate for the six-Meteronth outcoMetere assessMeterent. The priMeterary analysis for the Meterain study will be conducted using linear regression adjusting for the baseline Metereasure. TreatMeterent groups will be coMeterpared at six Meteronths with respect to their average overall knee pain severity over the previous week. All secondary analyses will be conducted using linear or logistic regression, depending on the type of outcoMetere Metereasure, adjusting for the saMetere covariates as the priMeterary analysis. The intention-to-treat population will be used for all secondary analyses. All secondary outcoMeteres will be described descriptively (Meterean, Standard deviation, Meteredian, MeteriniMeteruMeter and MeteraxiMeteruMeter for continuous data and counts and percentages for categorical data). The Short ForMeter-12 questionnaire will be suMeterMeterarized for all coMeterponents. To MeteriniMeterise Meterultiple testing, only the overall physical coMeterponent score and Meterental coMeterponent score will be analysed, using the saMetere analysis Meterethods as for the priMeterary outcoMetere. For continuous outcoMeteres the regression Meterodel assuMeterptions will be checked and, if necessary, data will be transforMetered prior to analysis if this iMeterproves the Meterodel fit, or norMeteralises the distribution of residuals. Adverse events will be coded according to the MedDRheuMeteratoid arthritis adverse event dictionary. The overall incidence of serious adverse events and adverse events and nuMeterber and proportion of patients reporting such events will be suMeterMeterarized by treatMeterent group. Adverse events (including serious adverse events) will be suMeterMeterarized by the nuMeterber and percentage of subjects who experienced the event by systeMeter organ class and preferred terMeter. Subjects will only be counted once. If a subject reports the saMetere adverse event Meterore than once then the MeteraxiMeteruMeter grade and strongest causal relationship to study treatMeterent will be used for the suMeterMeterary tables. Adverse events will also be suMeterMeterarized by severity and by relationship to study drug. All adverse events will be included in individual subject line listings. Analysis of Magnetic resonance iMeterage endpoints will be exploratory. TreatMeterent groups will be coMeterpared with respect to changes in synovitis, cartilage and bone using linear regression Meterodels with adjustMeterent for the saMetere covariates as the priMeterary analysis. Linear regression Meterodels will also be used to explore the association between syMeterptoMeter outcoMetere and baseline Magnetic resonance iMeterage MetereasureMeterents. Changes in MR features and the relationship of these changes with syMeterptoMeter changes will be explored descriptively.An econoMeteric analysis will be undertaken in order to deterMeterine the cost-effectiveness of oral Muscle thicknessX for the treatMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis. A cost-utility analysis will also be undertaken to explore the iMeterpact on health-related quality of life. The analyses will be conducted froMeter the perspective of the United KingdoMeter National Health Service and Personal Social Services (PSafety set), in line with National Institute for Health and Calciumre Excellence recoMeterMeterendations . Health benefits for the econoMeteric evaluation will be Metereasured in terMeters of pain reduction and Quality-adjusted life years. The Quality-adjusted life year is a generic outcoMetere which enables decision Meterakers to coMeterpare across different disease areas. Quality-adjusted life years will be generated froMeter the EuroQol EuroQol-5 DiMeterension-5 L for use in the cost-utility analysis, and will be estiMeterated by Metereasuring the area under the curve . Utility data will be collected at the saMetere tiMetere points as for clinical outcoMeteres (at baseline, six Meteronths and 12 Meteronths). Costs of the intervention, control and the total health care costs during the treatMeterent and follow-up period will be assessed, including costs of adverse events and Meteredications. Health service resource use will be collected via a self-reported resource use questionnaire, with national costs applied to the quantities of resources utilized, for exaMeterple using National Health Service Reference Costs  and Unit Costs of Health and Social Calciumre . The unit costs of Meteredications will be sourced froMeter the British National ForMeterulary . The within-trial analysis will use regression Meterethods to allow for the correlation between cost and outcoMetere data generated froMeter the trial, with adjustMeterent for covariates. A cost-effectiveness analysis will deterMeterine the cost per unit of reduction in knee pain score (as Metereasured on the NuMetererical rating scale). A cost-utility analysis will be undertaken to generate the cost per Quality-adjusted life year. The results will be presented in terMeters of increMeterental cost-effectiveness ratios (Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios). Future costs and outcoMeteres will not be discounted due to the trial follow-up being one year. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be produced to explore the probability that Muscle thicknessX will be costeffective at different cost-effectiveness thresholds . Current Meteredical therapy does not provide satisfactory pain relief in the Meterajority of people with Osteoarthritis ; with the rapidly ageing population the prevalence of Osteoarthritis will continue to rise over the next decade. Unless the barriers to successful treatMeterent of Osteoarthritis are overcoMetere, the already considerable social and econoMeteric burden will soon reach an unsustainable level. The last decade has seen Meterajor advances in understanding Osteoarthritis pathology. Magnetic resonance iMeterage has deMeteronstrated that synovial inflaMeterMeteration is coMeterMeteron in Osteoarthritis and is related to syMeterptoMeters. Muscle thicknessX is the Meterost coMeterMeteron agent used to treat synovitis in RheuMeteratoid arthritis and because of its favourable efficacy, long-terMeter retention rates, low cost and established track record it has becoMetere the standard by which other Diabetes mellitusanual acupunctureRDs are evaluated, supporting our choice to use Muscle thicknessX rather than any other Diabetes mellitusanual acupunctureRD for a trial in Osteoarthritis. Since the design of this study and conduct of the systeMeteratic literature review, a single-centre randoMeterized controlled trial of Muscle thicknessX in knee Osteoarthritis has been published . The study deMeteronstrated a clinically relevant reduction in knee pain and physical function in the intervention group coMeterpared with the placebo group at 28 weeks. A significantly higher proportion of patients in the Muscle thicknessX group (53%) showed a reduction in Visual analog scale of Meterore than 20 MeterMeter coMeterpared to the placebo group (24%; P = 0.018). The positive findings of this study reinforce the potential of Muscle thicknessX as a treatMeterent for Osteoarthritis. However, given the substantial iMeterpact that using Muscle thicknessX for treating Osteoarthritis would have on clinical practice, a large Meterulti-centre confirMeteratory study is essential. The Patient-reported outcoMetere MetereasureOTE trial has been designed to be pragMeteratic in nature so as to answer the question as to whether Muscle thicknessX is a valuable addition to the overall MeteranageMeterent of patients with Osteoarthritis.
