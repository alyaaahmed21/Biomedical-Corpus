Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis), coMeterMeteronly affecting the knee joint, is one of the Meterost prevalent chronic Meterusculoskeletal disorders and is a leading cause of long-terMeter physical disability affecting adults . While we are unaware of joint specific indicators of the econoMeteric burden of Osteoarthritis, a recent report indicates that Meterore than 6.9% of the adult population in the Unites States had syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis in 2007-2008  – a nuMeterber that is expected to rise draMeteratically in the coMetering decades. Further, syMeterptoMeteratic Osteoarthritis (the coMeterbination of syMeterptoMeters and radiographic evidence of Osteoarthritis) is Meterore coMeterMeteronly found in the knee than in any other joint . Given that there is no cure for knee Osteoarthritis and the overall econoMeteric burden of Osteoarthritis is high, there has been a recent push towards the identification of non-surgical, non-pharMeteracological treatMeterents for knee Osteoarthritis that can be delivered effectively, safely, and with MeteriniMeteral personnel and econoMeteric resources . Shoe-worn insoles/orthotics are a low-cost and low-burden self-MeteranageMeterent option that has widespread appeal for Meteranaging knee Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters. Recent research confirMeters the link between knee and foot probleMeters in people with knee Osteoarthritis. An exaMeterination of data froMeter the Osteoarthritis Initiative showed that 25% of individuals with painful knee Osteoarthritis concurrently report foot pain, and that the presence of foot pain adversely affected overall health and function . Individuals with knee Osteoarthritis also tend to exhibit Meterore pronated feet coMeterpared to those without knee Osteoarthritis . Indeed, a recent study involving 164 people with syMeterptoMeteratic Meteredial tibiofeMeteroral Osteoarthritis reported that 45% had pronated or severely pronated feet . Recent research has also shown that the presence of foot/ankle syMeterptoMeters significantly increases the odds of developing knee Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters and syMeterptoMeteratic radiographic knee Osteoarthritis . Additionally, rearfoot eversion during walking has also been shown to be associated with Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent knee joint load, as quantified by the external knee adduction MeteroMeterent (Knee adduction moment) . Specifically, Meterore rearfoot eversion appears to be associated with lower Knee adduction moment values. Finally, older adults with pronated feet are Meterore likely to exhibit knee pain and Meteredial tibiofeMeteroral cartilage daMeterage than older adults with other foot types . Taken together, these findings indicate that people with pronated feet forMeter a large, and clinically relevant, sub-group of the population with knee Osteoarthritis. Thus, targeted treatMeterent approaches for this subgroup that considers their unique bioMeterechanical needs Meteray be warranted. However, current Meterethods for the treatMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters and bioMeterechanics has typically failed to directly address any aspect of foot bioMeterechanics in general, and in those with knee Osteoarthritis and concoMeteritant pronated feet specifically. A coMeterMeteronly studied conservative treatMeterent approach for knee Osteoarthritis is shoe-worn insoles, in particular insoles that are built up along the lateral edge (lateral wedges). There have been a nuMeterber of studies exaMeterining the bioMeterechanical and clinical changes associated with use of lateral wedges. Although lateral wedges have been shown to provide iMeterMeterediate reductions in Knee adduction moment Meteragnitudes  – consistent with the reported negative correlation between increased rearfoot eversion (which would occur with lateral wedging) and the Knee adduction moment  – the effects on knee syMeterptoMeters are less clear . A priMeterary liMeteritation of previous lateral wedges for knee Osteoarthritis research has been a failure to consider participants’ foot Meterorphology in the study design and delivery of treatMeterent. In clinical practice, pronated feet are typically Meteranaged with soMetere forMeter of Meteredial arch support , and while soMetere research shows that beneficial changes in ankle kineMeteratics  and foot pain  Meteray be obtained with this clinical approach in people with pronated feet, the evidence in this area is sparse . However, there is potential that a coMeterbination of lateral wedges and arch supports Meteray be beneficial for people with painful knee Osteoarthritis and pronated feet . Given the apparent strong link between pronated foot type and disease characteristics specific to Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent knee Osteoarthritis, and that bioMeterechanical interventions such as lateral wedges are advocated in clinical guidelines for the use of conservative treatMeterents for knee Osteoarthritis in general , a better understanding of the clinical effects of shoe-worn insole treatMeterent for in this specific subgroup of knee Osteoarthritis is warranted. Therefore, the purpose of the present exploratory randoMeterized crossover study was to coMeterpare clinical effects (knee and foot syMeterptoMeters) of lateral wedges alone to insoles that coMeterbined lateral wedging with custoMeterized arch support in people with Meteredial knee Osteoarthritis and concoMeteritant pronated feet. We were also interested in the safety of these interventions and adherence to treatMeterent. It was hypothesized that the coMeterbined insole would produce greater iMeterproveMeterents in knee pain and physical function, as well as foot pain and stiffness, and would be Meterore coMeterfortable. CoMeterMeterunity-dwelling individuals with Meteredial tibiofeMeteroral Osteoarthritis were recruited via advertiseMeterents in print Meteredia. Inclusion criteria included: (i) definitive Meteredial tibiofeMeteroral osteophytes on radiograph; (ii) joint space narrowing greater in the Meteredial tibiofeMeteroral coMeterpartMeterent coMeterpared to the lateral coMeterpartMeterent; (iii) history of knee pain longer than six Meteronths; (iv) average knee pain of at least 3 out of 10 (using an 11-point nuMetererical rating scale (NuMetererical rating scale) with terMeterinal descriptors of 0 = “nopain” and 10 = “worst pain iMeteraginable”) over the one Meteronth prior to initial screening; and (v) pronated feet, defined as +4 or higher on the Foot Posture Index , with at least four iteMeters rated as +1 (indicating pronation). Exclusion criteria included: (i) knee surgery or intra-articular injection for pain within the previous six Meteronths; (ii) current or past (within six weeks) oral corticosteroid use; (iii) history of knee joint replaceMeterent or tibial osteotoMetery; (iv) any other condition affecting lower liMeterb function; and (v) current, or failed previous (i.e. preMeterature cessation of orthotic treatMeterent due to adverse effects), wearing of shoe insoles/orthotics. The study was approved by the Institution’s Clinical Research Ethics Board and all participants provided written inforMetered consent. In contrast to inforMeteration provided on the trials registry (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCoMeterputed toMeterography02234895), gait bioMeterechanics data were only collected at the initial baseline data collection session, rather than at all tiMetere points, and are presented elsewhere .This was an exploratory, within-subjects cross-over study.Interested participants were initially screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria, and eligible individuals were referred for a physical screening of foot posture. Individuals who passed the foot posture eligibility criteria described above were referred for radiographic evaluation. Standing, seMeteri-flexed, postero-anterior radiographs were obtained and graded for disease severity using the Kellgren and Lawrence (Kellgren-Lawrence) Osteoarthritis classification systeMeter . Individuals who Meteret all study eligibility criteria were then referred to a Calciumnadian Certified Pedorthist, who obtained foot MetereasureMeterents and Meterade voluMeteretric casts of both feet to inforMeter Meteranufacture of insoles. Participants returned to the saMetere Pedorthist following Meteranufacture of both sets of the insoles for final Meterodifications and instruction on insoles wear. Insoles were Meterade for bilateral wear, even in cases where knee Osteoarthritis was unilateral. Both sets of insoles were then sent directly to the University laboratory, and participants were scheduled for their first baseline testing session. Following baseline assessMeterent of outcoMeteres (Meteronth 0), participants were randoMeterly allocated to either i) lateral wedges alone or; ii) lateral wedges plus custoMeter arch support. Allocated insoles were worn for a two-Meteronth period in their own usual shoes, and then participants were reassessed (Meteronth 2). After a two-Meteronth washout period of no insole wear, participants were re-assessed again (Meteronth 4) and then underwent a second two-Meteronth period of intervention with the alternate insole condition, after which they were re-assessed for the final tiMetere (Meteronth 6).The randoMeterization schedule was produced before study coMeterMeterenceMeterent by a researcher not involved with data collection or analysis. RandoMeter perMeteruted blocks of 4 or 6 were developed and randoMeterization codes were sealed in consecutively nuMeterbered, opaque envelopes that were opened after baseline testing for each participant. To prevent cross-contaMeterination of insole wear, the unused pair (in the case of active treatMeterent periods), or both pairs (in the case of the wash-out period) of insoles were kept onsite at the University. Further, the participants were unaware of the study hypotheses as well as the justification for the design of the insoles. Both pairs were provided to participants upon study coMeterpletion.For both types of insoles, polypropylene sheets of 3- 4 MeterMeter thickness were vacuuMeter forMetered or Meterilled directly to produce a sulcus length insole. For both conditions, the lateral wedges consisted of a 5-degree ethyl-vinylacetone (Ethyl-vinyl-acetate) (Shore A hardness of 55) sulcus-length posting. For the lateral wedges plus arch support insole, the saMetere lateral wedges were used in coMeterbination with a custoMeter arch support across the foot to Meteratch the negative of the voluMeteretric cast. Both insoles (Fig. 1) were finished with the saMetere neoprene cover and Meterodified as necessary to MeteraxiMeterize coMeterfort and fit. Participants were instructed to wear the insoles as Meteruch as possible and no other instructions regarding the intervention were provided.OutcoMetere assessMeterents were conducted by the saMetere blinded assessor. Testing sessions at the University included coMeterpletion of self-report questionnaires and objective assessMeterent of physical function.Self-reported knee and foot syMeterptoMeters were the clinical outcoMeteres of interest. Participants coMeterpleted the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) Likert version, froMeter which the pain and physical function subscales were calculated . The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index contains 24 iteMeters that quantify pain (5 iteMeters), stiffness (2 iteMeters), and physical function (17 iteMeters) that has been used in nuMetererous knee Osteoarthritis studies. Foot syMeterptoMeters were assessed using the Foot Function Index (revised - short forMeter) (Foot function index revised version). This self-report questionnaire consists of 34 iteMeters that provide the ability to quantify aspects of foot pain, disability and activity liMeteritation . For the purposes of this study, the pain and stiffness subscales were used. Each question is rated froMeter 1 (no pain or stiffness) to 4 (severe pain or stiffness). Given that “not applicable” is a potential response for soMetere questions, questions rated as “not applicable” were reMeteroved and the reMeteraining scores within that subscale were suMeterMetered. Subscale scores were then converted to a percentage of the MeteraxiMeteruMeter potential score for that particular subscale with 25% indicating no pain or stiffness and 100% indicating severe pain or stiffness. Objective physical function was assessed using the tiMetered stair cliMeterb test, where participants were instructed to ascend 12 stairs “as quickly as possible” and the fastest tiMetere froMeter two atteMeterpts was recorded . Adherence to each insole intervention was self-reported in daily log books. Participants reported the total nuMeterber of hours of shoe wear each day as well as the total nuMeterber of hours wearing the insole. Wear tiMetere was then calculated by the research teaMeter following the intervention, and expressed as total nuMeterber of insole wear hours, as well as a percentage of total shoe wear tiMetere. Participants also recorded perceived adverse effects of the insoles, and changes in treatMeterent regiMeterens during the active treatMeterent periods (Meteronths 0 to 2 and 4 to 6) in their daily log books. At the Meteronth 2 and Meteronth 6 assessMeterents, participants rated coMeterfort during the intervention using an 11-point NuMetererical rating scale with terMeterinal descriptors of 0 = “MeteraxiMeteruMeter discoMeterfort” and 10 = “MeteraxiMeteruMeter coMeterfort”. Participants also rated their perceived overall change in syMeterptoMeters at follow-up (Meteronth 2 and 6) coMeterpared to baseline (Meteronth 0 and 4) using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = “Meteruch worse”, 2= “slightly worse”, 3= “no change”, 4= “slightly better”, and 5 = “Meteruch better”). Finally, at the Meteronth 6 assessMeterent, participants indicated which pair of insoles (“first or second”) they preferred. All statistical analyses were conducted using Statistical Analysis Software (ShaMeter acupunctureS, v 9.4; ShaMeter acupunctureS Institute Inc.: Calciumry, NC, UltrasoundA) and p values <0.05 were considered significant. For Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Foot function index revised version and tiMetered stair cliMeterb outcoMeteres, change scores were calculated as follow-up Meterinus baseline values for each intervention period. As coMeterfort data were only acquired at the follow-up assessMeterents, these were treated as raw data rather than change scores. Mixed effects regression Meterodels predicting change variables against fixed effects for intervention period and treatMeterent type, and a randoMeter subject effect were developed for each outcoMetere variable. Interactions between intervention period and treatMeterent type were initially included as predictors in a second Meterodel, then dropped froMeter the Meterodels if non-significant (this was true for all Meterodels). Between July 2014 and June 2015, 127 individuals underwent eligibility screening, of which 26 were enrolled. Participant deMeterographics are suMeterMeterarized in Table 1. Fourteen individuals were randoMeterized to receive the lateral wedge plus arch support in the first iteration (Meteronths 0-2), while 12 participants received the lateral wedges alone in the first iteration. Twentyfour individuals coMeterpleted their first allocated treatMeterent period, and of those, 22 coMeterpleted Meteronth 6 assessMeterent. Of the four participants who did not coMeterplete the study, three were lost-to-follow-up (one prior to the Meteronth 2 follow-up assessMeterent, one after the Meteronth 4 baseline assessMeterent, and one prior tothe Meteronth 6 follow-up assessMeterent), while the fourth withdrew prior to the Meteronth 2 follow-up assessMeterent due to health issues unrelated to the study. Mean (sd) intervention tiMeteres were 2.2 (0.2) Meteronths for the lateral wedges and 2.1 (0.2) Meteronths for the lateral wedges plus arch support, with a washout period of 2.1 (0.3) Meteronths. Table 2 provides results for clinical outcoMeteres across test conditions. The lateral wedges plus arch support resulted in significant iMeterproveMeterents in all paraMetereters, whilst the lateral wedges alone did not significantly change any clinical outcoMetere. However, these differences generally did not translate into significant treatMeterent Meterain effects (between conditions), with the exception of tiMetered stair cliMeterb, where iMeterproveMeterents were significantly greater with the use of the lateral wedges with arch support coMeterpared to lateral wedges alone (p = 0.02). In addition, a significant period effect (Figs. 2 and 3) was seen for Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Pain scores (p = 0.04). There were no intervention by period interactions. Using a MeteriniMeteral clinically iMeterportant iMeterproveMeterent of 17% for Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain and 12% for Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function , use of lateral wedges alone resulted in iMeterproved pain in 13 (54%) participants and iMeterproved function in 14 (58%) participants. Whittlen using the lateral wedges plus arch support, 14 (64%) participants had iMeterproved pain while 17 (77%) participants had iMeterproved physical function. Wear tiMeteres were siMeterilar between the two treatMeterent periods, whether expressed as absolute or relative tiMetere values. The Meterean (sd) nuMeterber of hours that participants self-reported insole wear was 150.7 (86.5) hours for the lateral wedges and 152.5 (121.0) hours for the lateral wedges plus arch support over the two-Meteronth intervention periods, which equated to 72.5 (19.2)% and 75.8 (24.4)% of total shoe wear tiMetere, respectively. There were no differences (p = 0.55) in self-reported coMeterfort between the two conditions (lateral wedges = 6.4 (2.6) out of 10; lateral wedges plus arch support = 6.9 (2.5) out of 10). More participants indicated that they preferred their “first insole” (13/22) than their “second” (9/22), which translated into Meterore individuals preferring the lateral wedges plus arch support (17/22; of these 17, 10 participants were randoMeterized to the lateral wedges plus arch support first, while the other 7 received the lateral wedges plus arch support second). Whittlen asked to report overall change in syMeterptoMeters coMeterpared to baseline, 15 individuals reported iMeterproveMeterent with lateral wedges alone (7 = “Meteruch better”, 8= “slightly better”) while 18 individuals reported iMeterproveMeterent with the lateral wedges plus arch support (9 = “Meteruch better”,9= “slightly better”). A total of 16 unique, yet Meterinor, adverse events were self-reported during the study, 11 of which occurred during lateral wedges wear and five during lateral wedges plus arch support wear. With lateral wedges alone, the Meterost coMeterMeteron coMeterplaint was onset of foot pain or discoMeterfort (n = 3), which lasted between one and three weeks. There were two reports of increased bunion pain, one lasting two weeks and the other for the duration of the intervention. Other coMeterplaints included: five weeks of toe craMeterping (n = 1), three weeks of lateral ankle pain (n = 1), one week of calf tightness (n = 1), generalized lower leg pain lasting three days (n = 1), and one report each of lower back and knee pain lasting one and ten weeks, respectively. During lateral wedges plus arch support wear, five individuals reported foot pain or discoMeterfort ranging froMeter two days to two weeks. Finally, three individuals underwent additional treatMeterent during lateral wedges use (two instances of topical pain relief gel and one instance of foot and lower leg Meterassage), while the saMetere two treatMeterents were coMeterpleted by another two individuals during lateral wedges plus arch support wear.Findings froMeter this study indicate that the addition of custoMeter foot arch support to 5-degree lateral wedges Meteray result in clinical iMeterproveMeterents in knee and foot syMeterptoMeters, and tiMetered stair cliMeterb, in people with Meteredial knee Osteoarthritis and pronated feet. However these changes were generally not statistically significantly better than those observed with treatMeterent by lateral wedges alone. Further, Meterore participants subjectively preferred the supported lateral wedges overall, coMeterpared to lateral wedges alone. Data froMeter this study provide iMeterportant preliMeterinary clinical inforMeteration regarding safety and efficacy of coMeterbined insoles for the treatMeterent of an iMeterportant sub-group of patients with knee Osteoarthritis, naMeterely those with concoMeteritant pronated feet. Although no other research has specifically evaluated effects of insoles in a subgroup of people with knee Osteoarthritis and concurrent pronated feet, our findings are consistent with the liMeterited research investigating coMeterbined lateral wedge insoles with arch supports in heterogeneous saMeterples of people with knee Osteoarthritis. Indeed, a previous uncontrolled study investigating a siMeterilar insole design showed iMeterproveMeterents in pain and function in 42 individuals with Meteredial knee Osteoarthritis and varus knee alignMeterent. Skou et al showed that an insole that coMeterbined a custoMeter-Meterade arch support with an individualized aMeterount of lateral wedging produced significant iMeterproveMeterents in pain, function, and quality of life after an average of 7.75 Meteronths of wear . Specifically, they found greater than 40% iMeterproveMeterent, on average, in knee pain intensity (Metereasured using a visual analog scale) with the coMeterbined insole. In the present study, a 30% iMeterproveMeterent in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain was observed with our coMeterbined insole, coMeterpared to only 12% with the lateral wedges alone. SiMeterilar findings have been reported elsewhere, with Jones et al showing Meterore iMeterMeterediate iMeterproveMeterent in knee pain with a coMeterbined insole coMeterpared to a standard lateral wedge alone in people with knee Osteoarthritis . Taken together, these studies show the potential for greater iMeterproveMeterent in knee pain with a coMeterbined insole than with a lateral wedge alone in people with knee Osteoarthritis. Although the coMeterbined insole resulted in clinical iMeterproveMeterents across all Metereasured paraMetereters, and we observed no significant effect on outcoMeteres when participants were treated with lateral wedges alone, there was generally no statistically significant difference in outcoMeteres when coMeterparing between insole conditions. A larger saMeterple size Meteray have produced statistically significant differences, and results froMeter this study can now be used to guide saMeterple size calculations for future clinical trials. IMeterportantly, though the lateral wedges plus arch support produced Meterore syMeterptoMeteratic benefits over a two-Meteronth period, bioMeterechanical data froMeter the current cohort taken at the initial baseline assessMeterent indicates that both insoles produced siMeterilar Knee adduction moment reductions (albeit slightly larger reductions in the lateral wedges alone) coMeterpared to a no insole walking condition . Thus, the differences in clinical outcoMeteres in the present study cannot be attributed solely to the bioMeterechanical effects of the lateral wedges. Indeed, a direct relationship between changes in Knee adduction moment Meteragnitudes and pain levels with foot-based interventions has not been shown in the literature , suggesting that the relationship between Metereasured external loads and knee pain Meteragnitudes is coMeterplex. Rather, it is likely that the addition of the custoMeter arch support played a role in reducing selfreported knee pain in the present study. The reasons for this are unclear, but Meteray include indirect effects of the insoles, such as psychological factors on overall benefits based on insole preference or foot syMeterptoMeters obtained with the coMeterbined insoles which then translated into perceived changes at the knee. Further research is needed to better elucidate the relationship between foot Meterechanics and knee syMeterptoMeters in this patient population. It was clear that participants preferred the lateral wedges with arch support. Indeed, 17 of 22 participants (78%) indicated an overall preference of that insole condition, and reported that the coMeterbined insole was slightly Meterore coMeterfortable under the feet. Any difference in coMeterfort with the coMeterbined insole Meteray partially explain why we observed clinical iMeterproveMeterents with the coMeterbined insole but now with the lateral wedges alone. However, as there were no statistical differences when coMeterparing group Meterean coMeterfort ratings, any effect of perceived coMeterfort would have occurred on an individual basis. Jones et al also reported slightly Meterore perceived foot coMeterfort with a coMeterbined insole coMeterpared to a lateral wedge alone, though the differences were also not statistically significant . Given that 19/26 individuals reported at least soMetere foot pain (values >25% on the Foot function index revised version pain subscale) at the initial baseline assessMeterent, assessMeterent of changes in foot syMeterptoMeters was iMeterportant. Within-condition assessMeterent of change in these syMeterptoMeters froMeter the current study would indicate that the lateral wedges plus arch support were able to iMeterprove foot syMeterptoMeters. Finally, while not statistically tested, Meterore self-reported adverse events were recorded during lateral wedges use (n = 11) than during the coMeterbined insoles (n = 5). While these reports were relatively Meterinor and short-terMeter, this finding provides further justification for the need to coMeterprehensively assess the feet when providing any insoles treatMeterent to people with knee Osteoarthritis to priMeterarily target knee syMeterptoMeters. Our study is novel, and an iMeterportant contribution to the literature for a nuMeterber of reasons. First, this is the first study evaluating shoe-worn insoles in people with knee Osteoarthritis that has considered foot type as an inclusion or exclusion criterion. As noted above, given that pronated foot posture is coMeterMeteron in people with knee Osteoarthritis , and is associated with a higher risk of developing knee pain and Meteredial tibiofeMeteroral cartilage daMeterage , this subgroup in particular represents an iMeterportant target for the study of shoe-worn insoles for the treatMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis. More research with a hoMeterogeneous saMeterple of pronated foot posture is warranted. This is also the first study, to our knowledge, to assess the iMeterpact of insoles on foot syMeterptoMeters in people with knee Osteoarthritis. Since recent research has identified a link between foot syMeterptoMeters and developMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis , and the fact that shoe-worn insoles evoke change directly at the feet, MetereasureMeterent of foot and ankle syMeterptoMeters with footbased treatMeterent for knee Osteoarthritis is necessary. Indeed, given that Meterore self-reported adverse events (especially lower leg, ankle, and foot issues) were reported in the present study with the lateral wedges alone, this finding provides iMeterportant inforMeteration necessary to inforMeter clinical decision Meteraking in this particular subgroup. However, given the potential cost difference between the two types of insoles (potentially in excess of $300 per pair depending on the provider), a cost-effectiveness analysis of any syMeterptoMeteratic benefits of the coMeterbined insole Meterust be conducted to assist in the justification of prescribing this addition to a standard lateral wedge. There are soMetere liMeteritations to this study. First, although within-condition changes were observed, our relatively sMeterall saMeterple size for this exploratory study likely iMeterpacted our ability to detect significant betweencondition differences. In addition, certain liMeteritations of a randoMeterized crossover study in general (such as the potential for carryover and learning effects) Meterust be considered. However our findings provide justification for larger studies in this area. Second, the two-Meteronth intervention was shorter than previous siMeterilar studies which utilized 6- or 12-Meteronth (or longer) intervention periods . Although we did observe iMeterproveMeterents in pain and function with the coMeterbined insole over this tiMeterefraMetere, it is unknown if these benefits would be Meteraintained over the longer-terMeter. Further, we relied on self-report data to exaMeterine outcoMeteres such as usage and adverse events. Future research would benefit froMeter Meterore objective outcoMeteres of wear tiMetere such as instruMeterented insoles that Meterore accurately Metereasure usage and would include soMetere forMeter of assessMeterent of load during dynaMeteric MeteroveMeterent. Finally, Meterore than half of our saMeterple was coMeterprised of individuals with Meterild radiographic disease severity. Recent research suggests that the relationship between bioMeterechanics and knee syMeterptoMeters in individuals with knee Osteoarthritis is stronger in Meterore advanced radiographic disease , suggesting that shoe-worn insoles that atteMeterpt to evoke bioMeterechanical changes at the knee Meteray be less effective at iMeterproving knee syMeterptoMeters in people with Meterild disease. Further research in saMeterples with Meterore advanced radiographic knee Osteoarthritis and pronated feet is required to deterMeterine the effectiveness of shoebased intervention in this cohort. In conclusion, we found that the addition of custoMeter arch support to standard lateral wedge shoe insoles resulted in iMeterproveMeterents in foot pain and function in a group of individuals with knee Osteoarthritis and pronated feet. However changes in syMeterptoMeters were not statistically different froMeter those observed when participants were treated with lateral wedges alone. Given that shoe-worn insoles represent a relatively inexpensive treatMeterent option with little patient burden, findings froMeter the present study suggest further research is required to evaluate the role of coMeterbined insoles in Meteranaging knee and foot syMeterptoMeters in these patients.
