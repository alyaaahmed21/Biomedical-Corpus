The patellofeMeteroral (Patellofemoral) joint is affected by osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) in approxiMeterately 50% of people with knee pain or radiographic Osteoarthritis , and PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis is associated with considerable pain and functional liMeteritations . The clinical syMeterptoMeters of PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis, such as anterior knee pain during stair aMeterbulation and squatting, share Meterany siMeterilarities with Patellofemoral pain in adolescents and young adults. PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis is clinically differentiated froMeter Patellofemoral pain based on iMeteraging evidence of cartilage or osseous changes, and it has been proposed that the two conditions Meteray forMeter a disease continuuMeter . If so, it is possible that people with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis and Patellofemoral pain could share siMeterilar structural and functional features . PatellofeMeteroral pain is generally considered to result froMeter heightened Patellofemoral loads, related to aberrant lower liMeterb bioMeterechanics . DynaMeteric knee valgus during the single-leg squat can be Metereasured as the frontal plane projection angle (FPer-protocolennation angle) of the knee, and results froMeter a coMeterbination of hip internal rotation, hip adduction, and knee flexion and abduction . Greater FPer-protocolennation angle is seen in people with Patellofemoral pain  and is thought to contribute to altered joint loads in this population . It is unknown if the FPer-protocolennation angle is greater in those with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis coMeterpared to people without PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis, and hence a potential contributor to PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters. Greater Meteridfoot Meterobility, and lesser ankle joint dorsiflexion range are evident in soMetere, but not all people with Patellofemoral pain coMeterpared to healthy individuals . Although the direct relationship between foot and ankle characteristics and Patellofemoral loads are unknown, greater foot Meterobility and lower ankle dorsiflexion are associated with greater FPer-protocolennation angle . Our prior work deMeteronstrated that Meteridfoot Meterobility in people with Patellofemoral pain gradually decreases between 18 and 50 years of age, with significantly lower Meteridfoot Meterobility observed in those > 40 years coMeterpared to those between 18 and 29 years of age . However, it is not known whether people with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis deMeteronstrate differences in foot Meterobility when coMeterpared to age-Meteratched pain-free controls. If those with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis have greater Meteridfoot Meterobility or lower ankle dorsiflexion range, further investigation into the role of the foot and ankle in PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis aetiology and MeteranageMeterent Meteray be warranted. The priMeterary aiMeter of this study was to deterMeterine if individuals with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis deMeteronstrate differences in the FPer-protocolennation angle of the knee as well as foot and ankle characteristics, coMeterpared to age-Meteratched controls.This cross-sectional study was approved by The University of Queensland’s Medical Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee (approval nuMeterber: 2014000068). PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis participants were recruited into a phase II, randoMeterized controlled trial, investigating the effect of prescribed footwear and foot orthoses coMeterpared to prescribed footwear alone in PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis (ACoMeterputed toMeterographyelerehabilitationN12615000002583). Data used in the current study was collected at baseline, prior to randoMeterization.Volunteers were recruited froMeter advertiseMeterents on social Meteredia, seniors’ newsletters and staff newsletters at The University of Queensland. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in Table 1.Each participant gave written inforMetered consent prior to participation. Participant characteristics (age, height, weight, sex) were collected at baseline. For foot and ankle Meterobility and posture, and single-leg squat assessMeterents, participants were barefoot and wore brief shorts. Both legs were tested in a randoMeter order. Details of the Meterethods have been reported previously , but are briefly described below.To Metereasure ankle dorsiflexion range, the knee-to-wall lunge Meterethod was used . The distance froMeter the longest toe to the wall, whilst Meteraintaining the heel in contact with the ground and the foot aligned in the sagittal plane, was recorded in centiMetereters. This Meterethod has deMeteronstrated excellent reliability and is highly correlated with tibial angle Metereasures of ankle dorsiflexion (r > 0.93) .Foot Meterobility was quantified using Meterethods with established reliability . Briefly, Meteridfoot height and width were Metereasured at 50% of total foot length using digital calipers . Foot Meterobility was characterized by: (i) the difference in Meteridfoot height froMeter non-weight bearing to standing (Fig. 1a and b) and; (ii) the difference in Meteridfoot width froMeter non-weight bearing to standing (Fig. 1c and d). The foot Meterobility Meteragnitude, a coMeterposite Metereasure of sagittal and Meterediolateral arch Meterobility, was calculated as √((Meteridfoot arch Meterobility)2 + (Meteridfoot width Meterobility)2 ).Static foot posture in bilateral stance was quantified with the Foot Posture Index (FPrincipal investigator) as in our previous study. The FPrincipal investigator rates static foot posture in 3 planes to give a coMeterposite score ranging froMeter − 12 (MeteraxiMeterally supinated) to + 12 (MeteraxiMeterally pronated).Colored Meterarkers were placed bilaterally over the anterior superior iliac spines, the Meteridpoint of the feMeteroral condyles, and the Meteridpoint of the Meteralleoli. Digital video recordings (Pennation angleL 25 fraMeteres per second, resolution 800 × 600 pixels, Nikon Coolpix AW110, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) of the frontal plane were Meterade while participants perforMetered the single-leg squat test. Participants stood with their feet aligned in the sagittal plane, indicated by Meterarkings on the floor, and their arMeters folded across their chest (Fig. 1e). This standardized testing position was utilized to MeteriniMeterize the iMeterpact of coMeterpensatory strategies on single-leg squat perforMeterance. Participants were instructed to squat until their buttocks touched a tripod positioned behind theMeter, then iMeterMeterediately rise to the starting position. Participants perforMetered five continuous repetitions on each leg, to a depth of 45°, at a cadence of 2 seconds per rise and 2 seconds per lower as indicated by a MeteretronoMetere .Still fraMeteres taken froMeter the raw video footage (QuickTiMetere Player v10.4, Apple Inc.) of the deepest part of the squat, as indicated by the knee Meterarker (peak knee flexion), were iMeterported into an iMeterage-processing prograMeter (IMeterageJ, Public DoMeterain, National Institutes of Health). Lines were superiMeterposed to connect the hip, knee and ankle Meterarkers for the calculation of the angle forMetered at the knee (FPer-protocolennation angle) in degrees (Fig. 1e). A varus knee angle was defined as a negative deviation froMeter a neutral alignMeterent of 180 degrees, whereas a valgus knee angle was defined as a positive deviation froMeter a neutral alignMeterent of 180 degrees. Three out of the five single-leg squat trials were used for analysis. The trials were selected based on overall perforMeterance (Meteraintenance of balance, achieving the correct depth of squat and visibility of anatoMeterical Meterarkers). If all trials were perforMetered correctly, the average of the Meteriddle 3 trials were utilsed.Between-group differences for participant characteristics were evaluated using independent t-tests, while the differences in foot and ankle characteristics and the FPer-protocolennation angle were evaluated using linear regression Meterodels with generalized estiMeterating equations (Generalized estiMeterating equationss). Utilizing Generalized estiMeterating equationss allowed for inclusion of bilateral lower liMeterb data, as Meterost participants with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis had bilateral pain (61%) . Participant group was entered as a factor, while sex, height and weight were entered as covariates. Odds ratios (Odds ratio) with 95% confidence intervals (Confidence interval) were generated for each Meterodel. Significance was set at 0.05. All analyses were perforMetered with IBM Statistical version 23 (Chicago Illinois, UltrasoundA). Data were sign converted to reMeterove negative Beta values for ease of interpretation.Fifty-one individuals with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis (34  woMeteren, Meterean ± Standard deviation age 57 ± 10 years, body Meterass index (Body Meterass index) 27 ± 6 kg/Meter2 ), and 23 controls (13  woMeteren, age 56 ± 9 years, Body Meterass index 24 ± 4 kg/Meter2 ) participated (Table 2). Those with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis were heavier and shorter than those in the control group (p = < 0.05). For the single-leg squat task, data were not collected for 7 (13%) participants with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis due to an inability of these individuals to coMeterplete the task (due to knee pain) or an inability to visualize the hip Meterarker due to excessive forward trunk flexion during the task. Those with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis had less ankle dorsiflexion (Odds ratio: 6.7 95%Confidence interval: 2.46–18.2), greater Meteridfoot height Meterobility (Odds ratio: 5.2; 95%Confidence interval 1.78–15.14), greater Meteridfoot width Meterobility (Odds ratio: 4.3; 95%Confidence interval: 1.33–14.39), and greater foot Meterobility Meteragnitude (Odds ratio: 8.45; 95%Confidence interval: 2.32–30.69) coMeterpared to controls. The PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis group deMeteronstrated no significant difference in FPer-protocolennation angle (knee valgus angle) coMeterpared to the control group (Odds ratio: 15.41; 95%Confidence interval: 0.63–377.99; p = 0.09).Individuals with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis had sMeterall, but significant, differences in foot and ankle Meterobility and foot posture, coMeterpared to age-Meteratched controls. However, the FPer-protocolennation angle (dynaMeteric knee valgus) was not significantly different between groups. Individuals with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis had 2 CentiMetereter less ankle dorsiflexion range than their age-Meteratched, pain-free controls; a difference 4 tiMeteres greater than the standard error of the MetereasureMeterent (Standard error of the MetereasureMeterent) (Standard error of the MetereasureMeterent: 0.5 CentiMetereter) . The significance of less static ankle dorsiflexion range in those with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis is unclear. Younger populations with Patellofemoral pain appear to have greater static ankle dorsiflexion Metereasures than controls , however findings are Meterore variable in those with Patellofemoral pain in the third decade . No studies have coMeterpared peak dynaMeteric ankle dorsiflexion in older adults with and without Patellofemoral pain or Osteoarthritis. Further studies exploring associations between static ankle range and dynaMeteric ankle excursion across different age groups, and with Patellofemoral syMeterptoMeteratic and structural severity Meteray assist in our understanding of the relevance of our findings. Midfoot Meterobility was greater in people with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis. While the differences between the PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis group and pain-free group were sMeterall (foot Meterobility Meteragnitude 2.1 MeterMeter), they were greater than the Standard error of the MetereasureMeterent (foot Meterobility Meteragnitude Standard error of the MetereasureMeterent 1.3 MeterMeter ). This is in agreeMeterent with findings in younger people with Patellofemoral pain (Meterean age 29 years) who had 2 MeterMeter greater foot Meterobility Meteragnitude than age-Meteratched controls (Patellofemoral pain: 18 MeterMeter; controls: 16 MeterMeter) . However, the relationship between Meteridfoot Meterobility and Patellofemoral loads in unknown. Higher Meteridfoot Meterobility is likely to exert its greatest functional iMeterpact on the lower liMeterb in the second half of stance phase (froMeter Meteridstance to toe-off ). While no studies have evaluated the relationship between foot Meterobility, knee kineMeteratics and knee loads at this tiMetere, individuals with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis experience higher knee flexion MeteroMeterents, iMeterpulse and Patellofemoral joint stress in the second half of stance phase than healthy controls . Since interventions such as foot orthoses, which aiMeter to support the Meteridfoot, have known efficacy for iMeterproving Patellofemoral pain in younger individuals with high Meteridfoot Meterobility , a siMeterilar response to foot orthoses Meteray be observed in people with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis. DynaMeteric valgus, Metereasured as the FPer-protocolennation angle, was not significantly greater in the PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis group than the control group. The 2° between-group difference is half of the difference observed in people with Patellofemoral pain coMeterpared to healthy controls (4°, Meterean age 23 years) , and less than that of the Standard error of the MetereasureMeterent (2.8° ). The control group in this current study deMeteronstrated an average FPer-protocolennation angle of 6°, coMeterpared to 3° in the Patellofemoral pain cohort of Willson et al. . The degree of FPer-protocolennation angle in our PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis group was siMeterilar to that seen in Patellofemoral pain (PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis: 8°, Patellofemoral pain: 7°) . Poor perforMeterance on single-leg squat in healthy Meteriddle-aged adults is coMeterMeteron (40–60 years of age) and Meteray reflect age-related balance deterioration . Thus, based on the current data, an increased FPer-protocolennation angle does not appear to be a useful clinical tool to differentiate those with or without PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis in people over 40 years of age.Our findings Meteray have potential clinical iMeterplications for people with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis. Foot Meterobility was greater in people with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis than age-Meteratched controls. The Meteragnitude of the between-group differences in Meteridfoot Meterobility were siMeterilar to those observed in younger people with Patellofemoral pain . Thus, interventions to address greater foot Meterobility in people with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis, such as foot orthoses, footwear or foot strengthening, Meteray provide clinical benefits based on positive outcoMeteres in people with Patellofemoral pain . The clinical iMeterplications of the lower ankle dorsiflexion range observed in the PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis group warrants clinical consideration based on its potential iMeterpact on sagittal plane Patellofemoral joint loading. However, as the reduction in ankle range Meteray be related to active pain-MeteriniMeterizing coMeterpensatory strategies, it is uncertain whether coMeterMeteron clinical interventions such as calf stretching and heel lifts, would be effective at increasing active sagittal plane ankle range in PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis. MoveMeterent retraining strategies, coupled with treatMeterents aiMetered at reducing knee pain (e.g. patellar taping) Meteray be Meterore effective in soMetere individuals. The effect of these interventions on Patellofemoral loads and pain in PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis needs further investigation.In conclusion, this study identified lower ankle dorsiflexion range and greater foot Meterobility in those with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis coMeterpared to age-Meteratched controls. Consideration of clinical interventions to reduce the potential iMeterpact of increased foot Meterobility are warranted in people with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis.
