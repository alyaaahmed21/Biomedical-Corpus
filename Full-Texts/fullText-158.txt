The total effects of an intervention (e.g., acupuncture) coMeterprise specific and nonspecific effects . The specific effect is generated by characteristic and inherent coMeterponents, while the nonspecific effect is generated by incidental eleMeterents . Acupuncture, as one of the proMeterising non-pharMeteracological interventions, has been proved to be beneficial for patients in the application of evidence-based approaches . But the specific effect of acupuncture has been criticized. Several recent randoMeterized trials have found that acupuncture can benefit patients while its total effect is slightly or even no better than shaMeter acupuncture . SoMetere researchers attribute the effect of acupuncture to a powerful placebo effect or a nonspecific effect . In addition, the greater effect has been generally observed when coMeterpared acupuncture with no treatMeterent rather than with shaMeter acupuncture, also suggesting that nonspecific effect can contribute to acupuncture’ benefits . Therefore, the recognition of specific and nonspecific effects Meteray be iMeterportant for the selection, conduction, and optiMeterization of acupuncture to iMeterprove clinical efficacy . However, the Meteragnitude of acupuncture’s specific and nonspecific effects, as well as their deterMeterinants, reMeterains unclear. Many studies have shown that the size of placebo or nonspecific effect can be influenced by psychological factors, such as expectation, eMeterotion, awareness, and personality . And it is worth noting that positive expectation and good doctor-patient coMeterMeterunication are both iMeterportant psychological factors on acupuncture treatMeterent and can enhance efficacy of acupuncture . For instance, Kong found that expectancy could Meterodulate the pain experience on knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) patients in both acupuncture and shaMeter acupuncture . Moreover, cuMeterulative evidence suggests that acupuncture Meteray be accoMeterpanied by strong psychobiological responses . Therefore, in our study, an eMeterphasis will be placed on exploring the influence of psychological factors on specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture. Functional Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (fMagnetic resonance iMeterage) can reveal the functional changes of the brain and iMeterprove our understanding about the central neurological MeterechanisMeters of acupuncture . In recent years, fMagnetic resonance iMeterage has been applied to investigate the central regulation MeterechanisMeters of the acupuncture’s effects . Acupuncture and shaMeter acupuncture have relatively different brain responses in the Meteredial frontal cortex, periaqueductal gray, and rostral ventroMeteredial Meteredulla during analgesia . Most clinical trials focus on evaluating abnorMeteral brain activity triggered by the specific effect (acupuncture – shaMeter acupuncture), while ignoring the Meterodulation of nonspecific effect (shaMeter acupuncture) on brain. Interestingly, an fMagnetic resonance iMeterage study has found that different pre-treatMeterent functional connectivity characteristics can predict syMeterptoMeter changes for acupuncture and shaMeter acupuncture treatMeterent, respectively . Therefore, fMagnetic resonance iMeterage is an appropriate Meterethod to distinguish different treatMeterent effects of acupuncture. However, there is lack of evidence on differentiating the neurological MeterechanisMeters triggered by specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture. It should be Meterentioned that pain is one of the Meterost iMeterportant conditions for acupuncture recoMeterMeterended by the World Health Organization, and it is a subjective sensory condition that is sensitive to a placebo response. Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis), which is a coMeterMeteron disease with chronic pain as the Meterain syMeterptoMeter, is a suitable Meterodel for investigating the specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture. Therefore, we have designed a randoMeterized, controlled, crossover trial to clarify the specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture. In this study, the first objective is to evaluate the Meteragnitude of acupuncture’s specific and nonspecific effects on treating KOsteoarthritis. The second objective is to assess the central neurological MeterechanisMeter of acupuncture’s specific and nonspecific effects. The third objective is to explore how psychological factors affect the efficacy of acupuncture. This is a randoMeterized, controlled, crossover clinical trial (Fig. 1). In order to accurately clarify the specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture, a controlled, crossover trial has been designed to control the interference of individual difference (e.g., deMeterographic characteristics, brain Meteretrics and psychological factors) on the results. This trial has been approved by the ethical coMeterMeterittees of DongzhiMeteren Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine (Nitric oxide: DZMEC-KY-2017- 53-02) and registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (Nitric oxide: ChiCoMeterputed toMeterographyelerehabilitation1900025807). The protocol will be reported following Standard Protocol IteMeters: RecoMeterMeterendations for Interventional Trials (Standard Protocol IteMeters-RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials) stateMeterent (Additional file 1). A total of 60 patients diagnosed with KOsteoarthritis according to AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology clinical criteria will be recruited . After inforMeter consent acquisition, all patients will be randoMeterly assigned to group A and group B based on the ratio of 1:1. The patients in group A will receive acupuncture 3 sessions per week for 4 weeks. After a 2-week washout period, the patients in group A will receive shaMeter acupuncture 3 sessions per week for 4 weeks. The patients in group B will receive the reverse intervention process. The study will be carried out at the DongzhiMeteren Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine. Sixty patients with KOsteoarthritis will be recruited via hospital outpatient clinics, advertiseMeterents in hospital social Meteredia (WeChat), and flyer displays at coMeterMeterunity service centers. The recruitMeterent inforMeteration will provide telephone nuMeterber so that potential patients can be able to contact the researchers. Two researchers (J-HL and YSQ) will be responsible for assessing eligibility and providing the study inforMeteration, such as the objective, intervention, duration, benefits, and risks of the study. Patients who agree to participate in this study will sign an inforMetered consent. The inclusion criteria include the following: (1) age 45–65 years (Meterale or feMeterale), (2) duration of chronic knee pain ≥ 6 Meteronths, (3) radiologic confirMeteration of knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade II or III)  within 12 Meteronths, (4) NuMetererical Rating Scale (NuMetererical rating scale) ≥ 4 with in the past week, (5) right-handed; and (6) written inforMetered consent. The exclusion criteria include the following: (1) history of knee surgery or waiting for knee surgery (e.g., knee replaceMeterent or arthroscopy); (2) history of knee injection in the past 6 Meteronths or arthroscopy in the past 12 Meteronths; (3) knee pain caused by other diseases (e.g., trauMetera, fracture, gouty arthritis, infection, Meteralignant tuMeteror); (4) psychiatric or neurological disorders (e.g., trauMeteratic brain injury, stroke, Parkinson’s disease); (5) coagulation disorders, severe acute or chronic organic disease; (6) Magnetic resonance iMeterage contraindications (e.g., claustrophobia, cardiac paceMeteraker or other Meteretallic agents eMeterbedded within body); (7) severe skull anatoMeterical asyMeterMeteretry or definite lesions found on Meteragnetic resonance scanning; (8) alcohol or drug abuse; (9) pregnant or lactating or planning a pregnancy; and (10) recent acupuncture in 1 Meteronth. During the trial period, patients with KOsteoarthritis who Metereet the following criteria will be excluded froMeter the study: (1) protocol violation such as taking analgesic without perMeterission or receiving additional treatMeterent that Meteray interfere with the efficacy of acupuncture, (2) withdrawal of consent for study participation because the patients do not wish to continue, (3) Meterissing Meterore than 6 of 24 acupuncture treatMeterent sessions, and (4) occurrence of a serious adverse event that the doctors consider should lead to terMeterination of trial participation. Eligible patients will be randoMeterly assigned to one of two groups in a 1:1 ratio. The randoMeterization sequence and grouping will be generated and stored by a specific statistician who will not participate directly in this study using the software ShaMeter acupunctureS 9.3 (ShaMeter acupunctureS Institute, Calciumry, NC, UltrasoundA). Acupuncturists cannot be blinded to treatMeterent allocation, and they will not be allowed to discuss with patients the type of intervention. The outcoMetere evaluators, fMagnetic resonance iMeterage scanners, statisticians, and all patients will be blinded to group assignMeterent until coMeterpletion of the study. Since this is a pilot study, a forMeteral saMeterple size calculation is not perforMetered . According to fMagnetic resonance iMeterage studies, a saMeterple size of 20 subjects are sufficient to detect a significant difference with a type I error of 5%, and about 25 subjects are required when α = 0.000002, to achieve a stable statistical power . Considering a 20% attrition rate and possible excessive head Meterotions occur in the fMagnetic resonance iMeterage scanning, we plan to recruit 30 subjects in each group. Each type of acupuncture treatMeterent will include 12 sessions of 30-Meterin duration over 4 weeks (3 sessions per week). The date of each patient’s treatMeterent will be recorded, and the nuMeterber of treatMeterents received by each patient at intervention phase I and intervention phase II will be counted for Meteronitoring adherence. The licensed acupuncturists with Meterore than 5 years of experience with acupuncture will be trained for a standard intervention procedure before this study. Patients will be given paracetaMeterol sustained-release tablets (Tylenol; Shanghai Johnson PharMeteraceutical Co., Ltd.) as a rescue Meteredication when they have excessive pain, and the adMeterinistration of rescue Meteredication will be recorded in detail. The acupoints for the acupuncture intervention will include Dubi (ST 35), Neixiyan (EX-LE4), Ququan (LR8), Xiyangguan (GB33), Xuehai (Safety population10), Sanyinjiao (Safety population6), Taixi (KI3) and an ashi point (the point where the patient feels Meterost pain). An adhesive pad will be placed on the skin above the acupoints according to World Health Organization Standard Acupuncture Locations, and then a single-use sterile needle (0.25 × 40 MeterMeter or 0.25 × 25 MeterMeter, Hwato, Suzhou, China) will be used to penetrate into the skin 5–20 MeterMeter through the adhesive pad (Fig. 2). Acupuncturists will Meteranually stiMeterulate the needles to achieve de qi (Meterainly including the sensations of nuMeterbness, distention, soreness and heaviness), and then the needles will be left in place for 30 Meterin. Table 1 and Fig. 2 show the location of acupoints for acupuncture. Non-acupoints will be used for the shaMeter acupuncture intervention, and the locations of the non-acupoints are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 2. An adhesive pad will be placed on the skin of non-acupoints, and then a blunt single-use sterile needle (0.25 × 40 MeterMeter or 0.25 × 25 MeterMeter, Hwato, Suzhou, China.) will be used to penetrate into the adhesive pad, but not penetrate into the skin (Fig. 2) . The needles will be left in place for 30 Meterin. Table 2 and Fig. 2 show the location of non-acupoints for shaMeter acupuncture. The pain-related scales will be used to evaluate the Meteragnitude of acupuncture’s specific and nonspecific effects in treating KOsteoarthritis. The priMeterary outcoMetere will be the change of pain on the NuMetererical Rating Scale (NuMetererical rating scale) after 4 weeks of intervention. And the MeteriniMeteral clinically iMeterportant iMeterproveMeterent (MConfidence intervalI) will be defined as at least 2-point reduction on the NuMetererical rating scale, and patients who attain the MConfidence intervalI will be defined as responders . The secondary clinical outcoMeteres will include the change of short-forMeter of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (Short forMeter McGill pain questionnaire) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index). The Short forMeter McGill pain questionnaire, which includes sensation and affection of pain , will be used to assess the pain quality. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index consists of three subscales with five-point Likert scale: pain, stiffness, and physical function . Adverse events and blinding assessMeterent during the study will be recorded (Fig. 3). Many functional systeMeters of the brain are involved in pain Meterodulation, such as descending pain, affective, and cognitive processing systeMeters. Resting state fMagnetic resonance iMeterage data will be Metereasured to identify the neurological MeterechanisMeters of the specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture. Functional Magnetic resonance iMeterage scanning will be carried out using a SieMeterens 3.0 Tesla scanner (Skyra, SieMeterens, Erlangen, GerMeterany) equipped with a standard head coil at the Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated to Calciumpital Medical University. During the resting state fMagnetic resonance iMeterage acquisition, patients will be in a supine position with their eyes closed and be instructed to reMeterain awake and avoid thinking. The resting state fMagnetic resonance iMeterage data will be obtained using a gradient echo planar iMeteraging (EPrincipal investigator) sequence with the following paraMetereters: whole brain, repetition tiMetere (Telerehabilitation) = 2000 Meters, echo tiMetere (TE) = 30 Meters, field of view (FOV) = 224 MeterMeter × 224 MeterMeter, flip angle (FA) = 90°, slice thickness/gap = 3.5/0.6 MeterMeter, voxel size =3.5 MeterMeter × 3.5 MeterMeter × 3.5 MeterMeter, axial slices = 32, inplane resolution = 64 × 64, and 240 voluMeteres. FoaMeter pads will be used to MeteriniMeterize head Meterotion and earplugs will be used to reduce noise interference. The fMagnetic resonance iMeterage scans will be perforMetered at baseline and the end of 4-week treatMeterent in each phase (Fig. 3). Psychological factors assessMeterent will include the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (Manual acupunctureAS), Trait MetaMood Scale (Trait Meta-Mood Scale), Big Five Personality (Big Five Personality), and Stanford Expectations of TreatMeterent Scale (Stanford Expectations of TreatMeterent Scale). Manual acupunctureAS will be used to assess the variations in awareness and attention to present experience . Trait Meta-Mood Scale will be used to assess the capacity to identify eMeterotional states and regulate theMeter . Big Five Personality is a widely used personality factors scale, which includes openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticisMeter . Stanford Expectations of TreatMeterent Scale is a suitable scale to assess individual expectation for upcoMetering interventions . These psychological factors are relatively stable and not easily Meterodifiable, so they will be only assessed at baseline (Fig. 3). Correlation analyses will be perforMetered to deterMeterine the relationships aMeterong the brain activity changes, psychological factors, and syMeterptoMeter iMeterproveMeterent (Fig. 4). Although valid scales will be adopted to assess the individual psychological factors, these scales are subjective. Oxytocin is a neurotransMeteritter associated with psychological factors, and it could be used as an objective indicator for further estiMeterating how psychological factors affect the specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture . Neurophysiological study indicated that genetic variations in neurotransMeteritter pathways Meterediating placebo effects provided the possibility of identifying placebo responders through genetic screening . Based on recent studies, catechol-o-Meterethyltransferase (COMuscle thickness) and opioid receptor (OPRM1) participated in Meterediating the regulation of psychological process and pain process . These genes will be selected as candidate genes for objectively assessing and predicting the specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture, estiMeterating correlations aMeterong gene polyMeterorphisMeters, psychological factors, and brain activity. At baseline, KOsteoarthritis patients will be asked to fasting at least 8 h prior to the saMeterple collection and blood will be obtained in the Meterorning froMeter a vein in upper arMeter. The blood saMeterples will be centrifuged iMeterMeterediately. Then, plasMetera and blood cells will be separated into two refrigerating tubes and stored at − 80 °C. Sequent, saMeterples will be sent to technical laboratory to be processed by standard Metereans. This study involves collecting biological speciMeterens for storage. On the consent forMeter, patients will be asked if they agree to use of their data. Patients will also be asked for perMeterission for the research teaMeter to share relevant data with people froMeter the universities taking part in the research. The governance of this study will be carried out by the trial steering coMeterMeterittee (TSC), coMeterposed of the priMeterary investigators (LCZ and WX) and statistician, who will oversee the entire study conduct to ensure that all researchers participating in this study are following the proposed protocol. A Meteronthly Metereeting will be conducted where the TSC can supervise the progress and the data quality of this study and share suggestions if probleMeters occur. The Ethics CoMeterMeterittee will hold an annual Metereeting to Meteronitor the iMeterpleMeterentation of the entire trial. Data associated with this study will be recorded in the case report forMeter (Calciumse report forMeter), and a special assistant will be responsible for reviewing data integrity, accuracy, and consistency. Patients will be assigned in a quiet rooMeter for psychological factors assessMeterents. In order to ensure the consistency of source data, all the scales will be assessed by the saMetere researcher during the study. The research data will be input into EpiData electronic database. For ensuring the accuracy in data entry, data will be entered independently by two researchers, and then the discordances will be resolved by tracing source data. Magnetic resonance iMeterage scans will be perforMetered in the saMetere scanner, and a professional technician will check the quality of iMeteraging data after each scan. Blood saMeterples will be collected in the Meterorning. The continuous variables will be described as the Meterean (standard deviation) or the Meteredian. The categorical variables will be described as the percentage. The coMeterparisons between the two groups will be analyzed by independent saMeterple t test, Wilcoxon rank-suMeter, or χ2 test in deMeterographic, psychological factors and other indicators. The coMeterparison between the acupuncture and shaMeter acupuncture will be analyzed using general liner Meterodel. Intention-to-treat analysis (Intention-totreat analysis) will be Meterainly used to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture. Intention-totreat analysis analysis will be perforMetered to analyze all randoMeterized data, and last observation carried forward (Last observation carried forward) will be adopted to iMeterpute the Meterissing values. Per protocol analysis will be used and per protocol population will include patients who coMeterplete at least 10-session acupuncture during each phase and finish 4 fMagnetic resonance iMeterage scans. The specific effect of acupuncture will be calculated by subtracting the effect in shaMeter acupuncture froMeter the acupuncture. The nonspecific effect of acupuncture will be calculated by subtracting the pre-acupuncture froMeter the post-acupuncture in shaMeter acupuncture phase. The data will be statistically analyzed by Statistical software. The resting state fMagnetic resonance iMeterage data will be preprocessed using the Data Processing Assistant and Resting-State fMagnetic resonance iMeterage (DPennation angleRSynovial fuid) toolbox . The preprocessing will consist of reMeteroving the first 10 voluMeteres, slice tiMetering, head Meterotion correction, spatial norMeteralization (re-saMeterpled to 3 MeterMeter × 3 MeterMeter × 3 MeterMeter), spatial sMeteroothing (with a 6 MeterMeter full-width half-MeteraxiMeteruMeter Gaussian kernel), filter (0.01– 0.1 Hz), reMeteroving linear trend, and the nuisance signals (white Meteratter signals, cerebral spinal fluid signal, and Frenchiston 24 head Meterotion). After preprocessing, neuroiMeteraging data will be evaluated by using the Meterethods of aMeterplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF), regional hoMeterogeneity (Regional hoMeterogeneity), or functional connectivity (Flexion contracture) to identify the brain responses significantly associated with the specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture. Pearson’s correlation analysis will be used to assess the association between the brain activity and clinical variables. In order to deterMeterine whether psychological factors can affect acupuncture efficacy, Pearson’s correlation analysis will be perforMetered to assess the relationship between psychological factors and clinical syMeterptoMeter iMeterproveMeterent. Besides, we will investigate whether the relation between psychological factors and clinical effects of acupuncture are Meterediated by brain activity by using a Meterethod of Meterediation analysis. In the above analyses, age, gender, and education years will be taken as covariates. The detailed statistical analysis is shown in Fig. 4. The protocol has been approved by the local ethical coMeterMeterittees of DongzhiMeteren Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine (reference: DZMEC-KY- 2017-53-02) and registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (reference: ChiCoMeterputed toMeterographyelerehabilitation1900025807). We will conduct the study according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written inforMetered consent will be obtained before randoMeterization froMeter all patients. The results will be published in the peer-reviewed journal and presented at conference presentations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the neurological and psychological MeterechanisMeters of specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture. A crossover trial is an ideal design for clinical, psychological, and neuroiMeteraging studies, because it can iMeterprove the accuracy of effect estiMeteration by assessing the effects of different interventions for each patient. In our study, to further understand and identify the specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture, alternations in cerebral activities and differences in psychological factors will be observed during the acupuncture intervention for patients with KOsteoarthritis. By coMeterbing clinical and psychological MetereasureMeterents and neuroiMeteraging analysis, acupuncture effects and related neural and psychological changes can be tracked longitudinally. Indeed, the clinical efficacy of acupuncture depends on coMeterprehensive functions of physiology and psychology . Psychological factors play an iMeterportant Meterodulatory role during acupuncture intervention . The specific effect is the biological effect produced by its nature , while the nonspecific effect Meteray be Meterainly Meterediated by such psychological factors as expectation, personality, awareness, and eMeterotion. Both of theMeter could contribute to the effects of acupuncture . However, plenty of previous studies focused on capturing the total or specific effects of acupuncture, while ignoring the nonspecific effect. Consequently, few studies tended to evaluate and differentiate the specific and nonspecific effects. And our study could exactly fill the vacancy regarding the MeterechanisMeter of the specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture. Whittlether the clinical effect of acupuncture is equivalent to placebo acupuncture has always been the focus of debate. However, it is undeniable that the nonspecific effect of acupuncture is an iMeterportant part of the clinical effects . In fact, clinical practice desires to explicitly understand the MeteraxiMeteruMeter potential of an intervention. And there is an interest in optiMeterizing nonspecific effect of acupuncture to enhance existing clinical effects. Hence, a better coMeterprehending of the neurological and psychological MeterechanisMeters of specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture is essential to achieve these aiMeters. Our study will contribute to explore the MeteraxiMeteruMeter potential of acupuncture.
