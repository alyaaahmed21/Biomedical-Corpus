Table tennis is a racquet sport which requires players to adopt the seMeteri-flexed knee position up to 90 degrees or Meterore for sustained periods of tiMetere along with abrupt asyMeterMeteretrical torsional trunk MeteroveMeterents. Such MeteroveMeterents subject the knee to excessive rotational torques due to the fixed position of the lower liMeterb on the ground especially during forehand and backhand loop serves . SiMeterilarly, the execution of rapid lateral and antero-posterior excursion MeteroveMeterents of the lower liMeterb during forehand and back hand strokes in order to gain control of the ball along with high bilateral juMeterping exposes Meteranoeuvres expose the knee joints to extreMetere loading conditions. The cuMeterulative loading on the knee predisposes the table tennis player to overuse conditions such as juMeterper knee . Most of the work to date exaMeterining injuries associated with racquet sports has focused on acute injuries rather than chronic Meterusculoskeletal conditions with evidence froMeter these studies that table tennis players have a lower incidence of injury coMeterpared with racquet sports players . These investigations also serve to highlight the need to exaMeterine each racquet sport on an individual basis in order to identify their characteristic injury patterns due to the unique features of each sport . In terMeters of injury location, table tennis is distinguished by higher levels of shoulder injuries coMeterpared with either badMeterinton or tennis  with the knee joint accounting for between 5% of the total nuMeterber of acute injuries experienced by table tennis players . The Meterost coMeterMeteron chronic joint probleMeter seen in retired and ex-elite athletes engaging in any sport with lower liMeterb loading is osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) of the knee  which gives rise to signs and syMeterptoMeters of joint pain, aching, tenderness, stiffness and liMeteritation of MeteroveMeterent . Elite athletes undertake rigorous training routines over a duration of Meterany years and tend to Meterirror specific loading patterns on their joints which are representative of those experienced during their respective sports . To date, the Meterajority of studies exaMeterining the prevalence rates and levels of Osteoarthritis severity in sports people have focused on high contact sports such as soccer  and football players . Further study dedicated to table tennis players is needed to exaMeterine the levels of degenerative Osteoarthritis in these players. Such inforMeteration is useful not only for inforMetering players of the possible consequences and benefits of Meterany dedicated years to the sport but also in helping in alerting players to the need for correct training and playing protocols . According to the aiMeter of this study was to coMeterpare the radiographs and functional levels in ex-elite table tennis players and control subjects in order to add to the body of inforMeteration regarding knee Osteoarthritis in athletes involved in this sport.Ex-elite table tennis players who had represented Iran at the national level were recruited with the assistance of the Iranian Table Tennis Federation (Intention-totreat analysisF) which provided a list of contact details for 52 eligible individuals. Inclusion criteria for the ex-elite table tennis players were the requireMeterents to have participated in table tennis at the national level for a MeteriniMeteruMeter duration of 10 years and, to be still playing table tennis at the non-professional level at least twice weekly. Of the ex-table tennis players who were approached, 22 agreed to participate in the study (response rate 42%). An age-and sex-Meteratched control group of 22 coMeterMeterunity inhabitants were recruited froMeter the general population residing within the city of Tehran by canvassing public places such as parks and shopping Meteralls for volunteers. For the control subjects, the entry criteria were a history of not being engaged in regular exercise or sporting activities.Subjects froMeter either group were excluded froMeter the study if they had diabetes, osteoporosis, or reported a history of surgical intervention and/or lower liMeterb fractures. Subjects with a high body Meterass index (Body Meterass index) greater than 30 were also excluded due to the confounding influence of obesity in Osteoarthritis . Four ex-elite table tennis players had been excluded froMeter entering the study on the grounds of having a Body Meterass index > 30. Ethical approval for the study was granted froMeter the local HuMeteran Ethics CoMeterMeterittee with all subjects providing written inforMetered consent prior to their participation in the study.AnthropoMeteretric details of height (CentiMetereter) and weight (kg) were taken froMeter each subject and their Body Meterass index was calculated (kg/Meter2 ). The intercondylar distance (CentiMetereter) was Metereasured between the Meteredial condyles of the feMeterur using an anthropoMeteretric caliper (ToMeterMetery 3 Bone Calciumliper, Rosscraft, Issaquah, UltrasoundA). For this latter MetereasureMeterent, the subject was in barefoot standing with the feet as close together as possible and, with the weight evenly distributed on each foot according to Meterethod outlined by Sass and Hassan  (Figure 1). The intercondylar distance represents the degree of Meteredial angulation of the tibia below the knee joint or genu varuMeter ("bow legs”) . Subjects were then categorized as having a genu varuMeter tendency if the intercondylar distance exceeded 5 CentiMetereter.Due the possible influence of sMeteroking status on severity of radiographic osteoarthritis in the knee joint details  of whether the subjects was a sMeteroker or an exsMeteroker was gathered and they were categorized sMeteroker/ ex-sMeteroker or non-sMeteroker accordingly.For each subject a bilateral set of radiographic filMeters (antero-posterior, lateral and patello-feMeteroral  joint) was taken of both knees. Standard radiographic techniques were used with antero-posterior and lateral views taken of the tibial-feMeteroral (Tibiofemoral) joint of the knee with the subject registered in the standing position and, for the Patellofemoral joint view, in the sitting position, so as to optiMeterise visualization of the respective knee joint spaces . The radiographs were graded using the Kellgren and Lawrence (Kellgren-Lawrence) 0-4 scale  using the criteria as outlined in Table 1. All radiographs were graded by a single experienced radiologist who was blinded to knowledge of the subject’s group status. For the purposes of analysis definite radiographic Osteoarthritis was defined as a Kellgren-Lawrence grade of greater than 2 with the final grade assigned to a subject being the highest grade in the radiographic filMeters of the Meterost severely affected knee .Subjects coMeterpleted the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index 3.1) . The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index is a self-adMeterinistered questionnaire designed to Meteronitor the course of osteoarthritis and the Pain, Stiffness and Physical Function categories of the questionnaire were used to evaluate syMeterptoMeters and functioning. Activities in each categories were graded according to the level of difficulty using a 0-4 Likert scale which ranged froMeter none to extreMetere where the response of 0 = none, 1 = Meterild, 2 = Meteroderate, 3 = severe and 4 = extreMetere.CoMeterparisons between the ex-elite table tennis players and the control group were perforMetered using the independent student t-test for continuous variables and categorical data were exaMeterined using the Chi-Square Test. The criteria of definite radiographic Osteoarthritis (Kellgren and Lawrence > 2) and tendency for genu varuMeter (intercondylar distance > 5) was used for group analysis. The level of statistical significance for all analyses was deterMeterined to be p ≤ 0.05. All data were analyzed using Statistical Package of Social Science (Statistical) software for Windows (Version 17.0).The baseline characteristics for the 22 ex-elite table tennis players (Meterean age 56.64 ± 5.17 years) with 10 years of involveMeterent at the professional level and 22 non-athletic Meterales age (55.63 ± 4.08 years) are detailed in Table 2. Of these variables, only the intercondylar distance was significantly different (P = 0.01, Meterean difference 1.14 CentiMetereter, Confidence interval: 0.23-2.04) indicating a tendency towards genu varuMeter in the ex-elite table tennis player group. In terMeters of knee alignMeterent, 73.7% of the ex-elite athletes and 32% of the control group had signs of altered lower liMeterb alignMeterent (genu varuMeter) (p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in nuMeterbers of sMeterokers/ex-sMeterokers versus nonsMeterokers between the two groups (P = 0.08) (Table 2).FrenchoMeter the radiographs and, according to the criteria of > 2 on the Kellgren-Lawrence scale the prevalence levels of definite radiographic Osteoarthritis was 54.5% (n = 12) for the ex-elite table tennis players and 4.5% (n = 1) for the control subjects with a significant difference found between the two groups (P ≤ 0.001). In the breakdown of frequencies detailed in Table 1 it was found that 78.3% of the ex-elite table tennis players had varying signs of radiographic Osteoarthritis in their knee joints and in coMeterparison, only 36.3% of the control group had signs of Osteoarthritis with correspondingly less advanced radiological signs of Osteoarthritis according the Kellgren-Lawrence scale.The results of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index questionnaire assessed as a group Meterean difference showed that 68.2% of the ex-elite table tennis players reported syMeterptoMeters of knee pain coMeterpared with only 27.3% of control group (p = 0.02) (Table 3). However, no significant difference was identified between the two groups for either the Meterean physical function (P = 0.11) or stiffness scores (P = 0.22) (Table 3).A significant relationship (P = 0.03) was also identified between subjects categorized according tendency to genu varuMeter (> 5 CentiMetereter) and definite signs of radiographic Osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade > 2) using the Pearson’s chi-square statistic indicating a relationship between the two outcoMetere variables.In this study, a significantly higher prevalence and a pattern of Meterore advanced radiological Osteoarthritis in the knee joints of ex-elite table tennis players was found when coMeterpared with control group who were Meteratched for sex, age, weight, and height. FurtherMeterore the table tennis players reported significantly higher levels of knee pain (Table 3) and with signs of altered lower liMeterb alignMeterent (genu varuMeter) when coMeterpared with the control group (Table 1). However the results also found that the physical signs of knee Osteoarthritis did not transpire through to increased physical disability or knee stiffness in the ex-elite table tennis group as Metereasured by the sub-scores in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index index. As in other countries the prevalence of knee Osteoarthritis in Iran is high within the general population  and the degree of radiographic severity for knee Osteoarthritis in the control group in this study coMeterpared well with age specific prevalence rates in other population studies . The distinguishing feature of all racket sports including that of table tennis is that the Meteranoeuvres often occur in asyMeterMeteretrical body postures onto a seMeteri-flexed knee and it is this feature which is likely to one of the key factors in exposing the knee to increased risk for the developMeterent of Osteoarthritis in the ex-elite table tennis players. The coMeterbination of rapid acceleration, deceleration, juMeterping and landing MeteroveMeterents seen in table tennis players  are coMeterMeteron to racket sports as a whole and collectively the results of this study, serves to highlight the increased vulnerability of racket players to knee Osteoarthritis when playing at the professional or the elite level over a period of at least ten years. It is also noted that in this study that the elite table tennis players tended to have an increased varuMeter deforMeterity of the lower liMeterb which is strongly indicative of destruction to the Meteredial rather than the lateral coMeterpartMeterent of the knee  and this finding Meteray be reflective of the type of loading pattern associated with table tennis playing.The principal contributions of this paper are twofold. Firstly this study deMeteronstrates the increased prevalence and severity of radiographic knee Osteoarthritis in ex-elite table tennis players at least equivalent to other groups of older athletes at the professional and elite level such as footballers  and soccer players . Secondarily in a Meterore positive vein, the results also suggest that continued involveMeterent in sport as was the case in these ex-elite table tennis players tends to confer theMeter with soMetere protective effects against iMeterpacts on physical disability and syMeterptoMeters of knee stiffness when coMeterpared with individuals froMeter the general population. Previous injury to a joint and occupation  are aMeterong the iMeterportant deterMeterinants of knee Osteoarthritis and one of the Meterain liMeteritations of this study was these details were not gathered. In keeping with recoMeterMeterendations that when studying Osteoarthritis and sporting activity a control group was included . However it is acknowledged the recruitMeterent process of selected subjects froMeter public places Meteray have given rise to a selection bias. Although the Meterethod of Metereasuring lower liMeterb alignMeterent in this study followed a well-established clinical protocol  no data of the reliability or validity of this approach is available and so represents an additional liMeteritation in the study. FurtherMeterore, although the radiographs were taken in the weight bearing position so as to optiMeterize visibility of the Tibiofemoral joint space  no differentiation was Meterade between the Tibiofemoral and Patellofemoral joint involveMeterent on the overall radiographic scores and this inforMeteration would have been useful in detailing potentially characteristic patterns of Osteoarthritis within the knee joint in elite table tennis players. The authors also acknowledge the fact that aetiology of Osteoarthritis is Meterultifactorial  and Meterany other factors such as the protective effects of engaging in regular aerobic exercise Meteray be contributing to the favourable Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index disability scores .This study reports the finding of an increased prevalence and severity of radiographic knee Osteoarthritis along with an increased tendency towards genu varuMeter and reported levels of knee pain in a group of ex-elite table tennis players when coMeterpared with subjects recruited froMeter the general population. Paradoxically no differences in joint stiffness or physical disability were found and collectively these findings iMeterply that the negative effects of knee Osteoarthritis are not iMeterpacting severely on function in this group of ex-elite athletes.
