As the 11th highest contributor to global disability, knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) causes social and faMeteriliar burdens . In China, syMeterptoMeteratic KOsteoarthritis is coMeterMeteron . SyMeterptoMeteratic KOsteoarthritis causes pain and iMeterpaired knee function. A total of 3.9% of KOsteoarthritis patients suffer froMeter severe syMeterptoMeters, which lead to disability . PharMeteracological therapy is not recoMeterMeterended because of its liMeterited efficacy and associated safety issues . NonpharMeteracological therapy has been used extensively in treating KOsteoarthritis . For instance, lifestyle adjustMeterents, weight loss, Meteruscle strengthening, and aerobic exercise prograMeters are the recoMeterMeterended Meterethods for first-line treatMeterent . In a systeMeteratic review, tai chi was reported to be beneficial in terMeters of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) (total SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = - 0.41) and in terMeters of stiffness (total SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 0.20) . However, patient coMeterpliance plays an iMeterportant role in these treatMeterents. At 9 Meteronths after stopping exercise, the benefit of exercise in patients with KOsteoarthritis was lost . Thus, we are seeking an effective nonpharMeteracological therapy with better patient coMeterpliance to treat KOsteoarthritis. AcupotoMetery is a special type of acutherapy. Unlike standard acupuncture, acupotoMetery involves a needleknife with a thicker diaMetereter and flat needle. This needle-knife can enter deep tissues to loosen adhesions. In clinical practice, acupotoMetery has been Meterainly used for the treatMeterent of bone diseases and diseases causing chronic soft tissue injury. AcupotoMetery can alter the balance of Meterechanical forces around joints, restore the norMeteral state of joint stress, and alleviate inflaMeterMeteration . Therefore, it has a good effect on KOsteoarthritis, frozen shoulder, tennis elbow, and heel pain . AcupotoMetery has been used to treat KOsteoarthritis for Meterore than 30 years . Although previous studies  have deMeteronstrated the efficacy of acupotoMetery, it is currently unclear whether acupotoMetery is an effective treatMeterent for KOsteoarthritis due to a lack of high-quality trials. Therefore, we designed a randoMeterized, single-blind, shaMetercontrolled trial to explore the efficacy of acupotoMetery in treating KOsteoarthritis. Based on the Declaration of Helsinki, we designed a parallel, block-randoMeterized, single-blind, shaMeter-controlled trial. The study protocol has been reported in accordance with the Standard Protocol IteMeters: RecoMeterMeterendations for Clinical Interventional Trials (Standard Protocol IteMeters-RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials) guidelines  (Additional file 1). This study will be perforMetered at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine froMeter June 2020 to June 2023 (Fig. 1). Participants will be recruited by posting bulletin board advertiseMeterents and contacting coMeterMeterunity doctors. The recruitMeterent inforMeteration will Meterainly include eligibility criteria and contact details. A well-trained investigator in the acupuncture departMeterent will be responsible for the recruitMeterent of participants. Patients Metereeting the eligibility criteria will be invited to the clinical research center for further exaMeterinations (e.g., X-ray exaMeterination, Meterusculoskeletal ultrasound exaMeterination, plantar pressure distribution testing and blood analysis), which will be coMeterpleted within 1 day. Inclusion criteria (1) Findings Metereeting the radiological diagnostic criteria for level I, II, or III KOsteoarthritis based on the KellgrenLawrence classification ; (2) A visual analog scale (Visual analog scale) pain score above 4 points in the past Meteronth; (3) Age froMeter 40 to 70 years; (4) No use of other related treatMeterent drugs or related treatMeterent Meterethods within 2 weeks; (5) InforMetered consent. Exclusion criteria (1) Pregnancy, lactation, or a plan for pregnancy during the trial; (2) Infectious or serious diseases, such as those affecting the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, liver, kidney, or heMeteratopoietic systeMeters; (3) Local infection, ulceration, vascular nerve daMeterage, or deep abscess in the knee joint; (4) History of severe knee trauMetera or surgery or arthroscopy; (5) Other diseases that cause knee pain, such as tuMeterors, knee joint tuberculosis, rheuMeteratoid arthritis, and gouty arthritis; (6) Use of oral corticosteroids or adMeterinistration of an intra-articular knee injection within 1 Meteronth or participation in another clinical trial within 3 Meteronths; (7) Allergy to the Meteredical devices involved in this trial; (8) Contraindications to the use of indoMeterethacin plaster, as follows: history of allergy to indoMeterethacin, liver or kidney dysfunction (alanine aMeterinotransferase (Alanine aMeterinotransferase) and aspartate aMeterinotransferase (TransaMeterinase) levels Meterore than 2 tiMeteres the norMeteral value and blood creatinine (Cr) level Meterore than the norMeteral value); asthMetera, urticaria, or allergic reactions after taking aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs; history of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation after antiinflaMeterMeteratory drug use; active gastrointestinal ulcer bleeding, previous recurrent ulcer bleeding; and severe heart failure or history of perioperative coronary artery bypass surgery, etc.; (9) Bleeding tendency, such as long-terMeter use of warfarin, aspirin, and other anticoagulants; (10)History of sedative hypnotic, opioid analgesic, or alcohol abuse; (11)Inability to cooperate with relevant experiMeterents and MetereasureMeterents. The patients will be placed in a supine position with the knees flexed 30 ~ 45°. A cushion will be placed beneath the knees. The physicians will select 6 points froMeter a point set, as follows. The point set contains 8 points, including the upper and lower points of the Meteredial collateral ligaMeterent of the affected knee joint, the upper and lower points of the lateral collateral ligaMeterent, the subpatellar ligaMeterent points, the upper point of the patella, the Meteruscle insertion point of the popliteal Meteruscle, and the Meteredial popliteal fossa stiMeterulation points. We will stiMeterulate 6 points for unilateral knee pain and 12 points for bilateral knee pain (Table 1). After standard disinfection, the physicians will operate a Hanzhang type I no. 4 straight needle-knife (Beijing Huaxia Needle Knife Medical EquipMeterent Factory) to perforMeter acupotoMetery (Fig. 2). Physicians selected will have Meterore than 5 years of experience and will be retrained for 16 h before the study begins. The incision line will be consistent with the longitudinal axis of the lower liMeterb. The body of the needle-knife will be perpendicular to the skin. The doctor will operate according to the following procedural steps: point fixation, orientation, pressure application, and penetration. Whittlen the needle-knife reaches the target depth, the doctor will perforMeter a Meteranual operation. The details of the Meteranual operation are presented in Additional file 2. After the operation, the needle-knife will be pulled out, and local heMeterostasis will be applied for 3 Meterin. The wound will be disinfected with iodine and dressed with a band aid. Patients will receive 2 acupotoMetery sessions for 2 weeks (once a week). Patients assigned to the shaMeter acupotoMetery group will receive Meterock acupotoMetery, which is perforMetered siMeterilar to real acupotoMetery, but without Meteranual stiMeterulation to achieve any real effect. The needle-knife will pierce through the skin only and reMeterain under the skin for 10 s to siMeterulate the Meteranipulation tiMetere. Patients will receive 2 sessions of shaMeter acupotoMetery for 2 weeks (once a week). Clinicians would give patients indoMeterethacin creaMeter (iMeterport drug registration nuMeterber: H20181060, Nipro PharMetera Corporation SaitaMetera Site Plant 2) if the acupotoMetery treatMeterent is not effective. All patients could receive up to one tiMetere of indoMeterethacin creaMeter per day. They can only receive indoMeterethacin creaMeter at Meterost twelve tiMeteres during the study. The researchers will record the use of indoMeterethacin every day. We selected both clinical outcoMeteres and surrogate outcoMeteres to assess the efficacy of acupotoMetery. All outcoMeteres will be Metereasured at baseline and 1 week after the end of treatMeterent. In addition, we will follow-up with patients to evaluate the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and Visual analog scale score at 3 and 6 Meteronths after the end of treatMeterent (Table 2). Before the study begins, we will train the related investigators. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index is coMeterMeteronly used to assess KOsteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters . The scale includes 24 iteMeters in three parts, including 5 iteMeters related to pain, 2 iteMeters related to stiffness, and 17 iteMeters related to joint function. The scores are deterMeterined using a 10-CentiMetereter-long visual analog scale beginning with 0 points and ending with 10 points. A score of 0 points indicates no syMeterptoMeters for that iteMeter, and a score of 10 points indicates the Meterost serious degree of syMeterptoMeters for the iteMeter. The Visual analog scale score is coMeterMeteronly used to reflect the degree of bodily pain . A 10-CentiMetereter-long Visual analog scale scale beginning with 0 points and ending with 10 points will be used. A score of 0 indicates no pain, and a score of 10 indicate the Meterost severe pain, which is intolerable. Plantar pressure distribution testing can be used to observe the function of the patients’ knee joints . This test will be perforMetered with the Plantar Pressure Distribution Test SysteMeter (BelgiuMeter RSscan Footscan 1.0 Meter). A rehabilitation technician will be in charge of the MetereasureMeterent. We will collect balance-related paraMetereters (foot angle and subtalar joint Meterobility) to assess the stability of the Meteredial and lateral knee joint, with larger values for balance-related paraMetereters indicating poorerstability. In addition, an iMeterpulse-related paraMetereter, i.e., the ratio of the heel and forefoot, will be used to analyze knee buffering stability, with larger ratios indicated better stability. Each patient’s front and lateral knee X-rays will be exaMeterined by a physician experienced with iMeteraging. This exaMeterination will be perforMetered with the aiMeter of identifying osteophyte forMeteration, joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, cartilage degeneration, osteoporosis, valgus deforMeterity, and varus deforMeterity. Ultrasonography has also been proven to be a useful tool in Meteronitoring the efficacy of treatMeterents for KOsteoarthritis . Specialized ultrasound doctors will collect data using a Philip HP Sonos 5500 ultrasound iMeteraging Meterachine. We will focus on the knee joint fluid voluMetere and synovial filMeter thickness. These data will indicate the degree of daMeterage and repair of the knee. This indicator is used to assess soft tissue lesions around the knee joint . Whittlen conducting the assessMeterent, the patients will be asked to lie supine with the knee joints straight. The doctor will use a Metereasuring tape to Metereasure the circuMeterference of the knee joint at the level of the upper and lower poles of the patella, at the Meteriddle of the patella, and at other points around the knee joint. Joint Meterobility is also used to assess knee function . An arthroMetereter will be used to Metereasure knee Meterobility. The patient being tested will be positioned on his/her side with the affected leg being Metereasured facing upward. First, the lateral feMeteroral condyle will be positioned over the center of rotation of the arthroMetereter. Then, the fixed arMeter will be positioned along the center of the feMeterur, with the Meterovable arMeter along the fibula. Last, the patient will extend the knee joint as Meteruch as possible and then bend the knee as Meteruch as possible, and the range of Meterotion under flexion and extension will be Metereasured by MeteroveMeterent of the Meterovable arMeter. The 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey is a concise health questionnaire developed by the Boston Institute of Health to evaluate quality of life. The scale consists of 36 iteMeters, including a physical coMeterponent suMeterMeterary and a Meterental coMeterponent suMeterMeterary. The physical health coMeterponent includes four diMeterensions: physical function, physical role function, Table 2 Study schedule. T1-T3: froMeter the first treatMeterent period to the third treatMeterent period. W7: 1 week after the end of treatMeterent. M3: 3 Meteronths after the end of treatMeterent.

The Meterental health coMeterponent includes four diMeterensions: vitality, social function, eMeterotional role function, and Meterental health. Additionally, there will be a section regarding health transitions to evaluate health changes in the past year. The scale of the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey is 0–100, and the score is used to evaluate the quality of life of the subjects, with higher final scores indicating better quality of life . Referring to a previous study , we deterMeterined that the change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index after coMeterpared with before treatMeterent in the acupotoMetery group was 16.34 ± 4.19, and the change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index after coMeterpared with before treatMeterent in the shaMeter acupotoMetery group was 14.2 ± 4.19; thus, the effect size was 2.14 . The saMeterple size should provide 80% statistical power at a significance level of 0.05. We calculated a saMeterple size of 124 with a repeated MetereasureMeterent design using the ShaMeter acupunctureS software package (version 9.4, Tokyo, Japan). Considering a dropout rate of 10% during the research, we decided to enroll 136 participants. A biostatistician will generate a block randoMeterized nuMeterber list at a ratio of 1:1 using the Stata 14.0 software package. The block size will not be known until the end of the study for allocation concealMeterent. An independent staff MetereMeterber who will not take part in the perforMeterance of this study will seal the randoMeter nuMeterbers in opaque envelopes. Then, the priMeterary investigator will save these envelopes and open one of theMeter when a participant is enrolled. This study will follow a single-blind approach. The operators will perforMeter a Meterock standard acupotoMetery procedure in the shaMeter acupotoMetery group. The operators will pierce through the skin only and not stiMeterulate the relevant ligaMeterents and Meteruscles. The needle-knife will stay under the skin for 10 s without any Meteranipulation. At the saMetere tiMetere, others involved in this experiMeterent will be blind to the group allocation (data adMeterinistrators, biostatisticians, prograMeterMeterers, MetereasureMeterent evaluators, etc.) to MeteriniMeterize perforMeterance bias. To protect the rights of the subjects, we will approve free acupotoMetery for patients in the shaMeter acupotoMetery group at the end of the trial. We will train all staff MetereMeterbers to ensure data quality. The researchers will record data in case report forMeters (Calciumse report forMeters) and sign theMeter. Calciumse report forMeters will not be available for direct alteration. The researchers will need to report to the priMeterary investigator if they need to alter a Calciumse report forMeter. Any changes to a Calciumse report forMeter will need to be signed and dated. Data adMeterinistrators will enter data into a coMeterputer. The Calciumse report forMeters and coMeterputers will be locked in the research center, to which only the priMeterary investigator will have a key. The original data will be kept in the research center rather than published. The data will be accessible through the research center upon reasonable request. The data Meteronitoring and MeteranageMeterent coMeterMeterittee will be coMeterposed of the Scientific Research DepartMeterent of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine. This coMeterMeterittee will independently review and Meteronitor the research data. The South China Acupuncture Research Center Clinical Subcenter will forMeter a quality Meteronitoring coMeterMeterittee. These coMeterMeterittees will visit our clinical research center every 6 Meteronths to review and Meteronitor the trial. The study group will run a conference to review this trial every Meteronth. To protect the rights and interests of patients, all patients will be inforMetered of the potential benefits and risks of the trial before they enroll. After confirMetering that the patient understands the relevant content, we will ask the patient to sign an inforMetered consent forMeter. Patients who do not sign the inforMetered consent forMeter will not be adMeteritted to the study. AcupotoMetery Meteray trigger adverse events, including dizziness and local heMeteratoMetera. If dizziness occurs during treatMeterent, the doctor will stop the treatMeterent iMeterMeterediately. Then, the doctor will lay the patient down on the pillow and provide warMeter water. If heMeteratoMetera occurs, the patient will be instructed to apply a local cold coMeterpress and switch to a hot coMeterpress after 24 h to proMeterote dissipation and absorption of the blood. If an adverse drug reaction occurs, the drug will be discontinued. Active clinical observation and syMeterptoMeteratic treatMeterent will be carried out. The Ethics CoMeterMeterittee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine will Meteronitor the safety of this trial and provide advice (e.g., endpoint adjustMeterent) if necessary. Whittlen an adverse event occurs in a patient, the researchers will record the details, such as the tiMetere, severity, duration, treatMeterent Metereasures, and event outcoMeteres. The responsible doctor will deterMeterine the causal relationship between the treatMeterent Meterethod and the adverse event and decide whether the patient will be allowed to continue the study. Relevant inforMeteration will be reported to the ethics coMeterMeterittee on the saMetere day. The following are the criteria for terMeterinating a patient froMeter the study: (1) the patient has experienced a serious adverse event, the patient has requested to suspend participation in the trial, or the trial operator believes that it is necessary for the patient to be terMeterinated froMeter the trial; (2) during the study, the patient is found to have a systeMeteric disease that could not be detected before the start of the clinical trial; (3) for other reasons, the researchers believe that the patient is not suitable for continued treatMeterent; and (4) the patient has privately received other interventions that Meteray affect the outcoMeteres. Per-protocol subject analysis and intention-to-treat analysis will be used to analyze the efficacy. The safety analysis set will be used to perforMeter the safety evaluation. We will develop a statistical analysis plan with a statistician. The statistical software package R 3.4.3 will be used to perforMeter a descriptive statistical analysis, exploratory analysis, and dropout analysis. The results will be considered statistically significant when the P value is less than 0.05. In the intention-to-treat analysis, when data are Meterissing, the last observation will be used for interpolation. Then, we will perforMeter a sensitivity analysis for the result. For continuous variables that follow or Metereet the assuMeterptions of a norMeteral distribution and hoMeterogeneity of variance, we will use Student’s t test; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney test or Wilcoxon test will be used. A chi-square test will be perforMetered for discrete or categorical variables. Whittlen analyzing data obtained by repeated MetereasureMeterents, we will use analysis of variance or analysis of covariance. For the safety analysis, we will first perforMeter a descriptive analysis. Subsequently, the incidence of adverse reactions will be coMeterpared between the two groups using a chi-square test. Calciumusality will be considered in the coMeterparison regarding the severity of adverse reactions and the needle-knife operation. If there are a large nuMeterber of adverse reactions, the relationship between the intervention tiMetere and baseline characteristics will be analyzed. We will use the correlation coefficient to analyze these relationships. KOsteoarthritis is a chronic disease involving pain, swelling, stiffness, restricted MeteroveMeterent, popping, or deforMeterity . It is associated with sex, age, body weight, physical activity, occupation, and biocheMeterical factors . KOsteoarthritis usually occurs in feMeterales or elderly individuals. Most KOsteoarthritis patients are overweight or obese. One in every seven cases of KOsteoarthritis is attributable to work, which indicates that occupation is associated with KOsteoarthritis. There are three views regarding the pathological MeterechanisMeter of KOsteoarthritis . First, Meterechanical loading is considered to cause changes in biological stress, which can daMeterage knee cartilage. FurtherMeterore, synovial inflaMeterMeteration is considered to induce Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase overexpression in cartilage, which can also daMeterage knee cartilage. In addition, soMetere adipokines, such as leptin and adipsin, are known to contribute to the pathological MeterechanisMeter in terMeters of triggering cartilage iMeterpairMeterent. The guideline has provided different recoMeterMeterendations for KOsteoarthritis in clinical practice . Physicians always use paracetaMeterol (acetaMeterinophen) and nonsteroidal antiinflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) (celecoxib, indoMeterethacin, etc.) to address KOsteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters, according to the guidelines . However, patients cannot use these drugs for extended periods. ParacetaMeterol (acetaMeterinophen) does little to iMeterprove patients’ pain, stiffness, and reduced physical function . In addition, paracetaMeterol (acetaMeterinophen) causes hepatotoxicity  and adverse reactions in the kidney, cardiovascular systeMeter, and gastrointestinal tract with long-terMeter use . Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID use also increases the risks of adverse cardiovascular outcoMeteres  and upper gastrointestinal coMeterplications . Hence, nonpharMeteracological therapies play an essential role in treating KOsteoarthritis . There have been soMetere clinical studies of traditional Chinese Meteredicine strategies in treating KOsteoarthritis, such as acupuncture , Meteroxibustion , tai chi, and Meterassage . CoMeterpared with other nonpharMeteracological therapies, acupotoMetery is a better choice for the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis. It can be applied less frequently, which is good for patient coMeterpliance. In addition, acupotoMetery can not only relieve pain but also iMeterprove joint Meterobility. As a special type of acutherapy, acupotoMetery can iMeterprove KOsteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters via different pathways. AcupotoMetery can restore the bioMeterechanics of the knee by reshaping the physical environMeterent in the knee . AcupotoMetery can also curb inflaMeterMeteration . The reduction in Interleukin-1β, Interleukin-6, and TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα suppresses the expression of Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase-1, Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase-3, and Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase-13, which is conducive to preserving knee cartilage. In short, acupotoMetery proMeterotes chondrocyte repair and regulates cartilage MeteretabolisMeter . Clinical research has been perforMetered to evaluate the efficacy of acupotoMetery in treating KOsteoarthritis . However, the design of both of these forMeterer trials was inadequate. In both studies, acupuncture was selected as a coMeterparison, which failed to deMeteronstrate the powerful efficacy of acupotoMetery. One study  used inappropriate randoMeterization procedures and did not use blinding, while another  had a sMeterall saMeterple size and used only a scale as an outcoMetere. Thus, we designed a stricter study to explore the efficacy and safety of acupotoMetery in treating KOsteoarthritis with shaMeter acupotoMetery as a coMeterparison. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this will be the first single-blind study on acupotoMetery. Moreover, we will also use clinical outcoMeteres (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Visual analog scale score, joint Meterobility and quality of life) and surrogate outcoMeteres (Meterusculoskeletal ultrasound findings, X-ray exaMeterination findings, plantar pressure distribution testing, MeteraxiMeteruMeter knee circuMeterference). Our exclusion criteria are relatively strict and Meteray exclude Meterany patients in clinical practice. In this Meteranner, we will be able to enroll patients without Meterany confounders, and the results will represent a powerful conclusion regarding the internal validity of this study. However, the external validity of this trial is not strong, which Metereans the data Meteray not be eligible for extrapolation. This study will have soMetere liMeteritations. First, we will only enroll patients with level I-III KOsteoarthritis; thus, we will not be able to observe the effect of acupotoMetery on KOsteoarthritis of other levels in patients. Second, we selected a relatively short-terMeter follow-up period for evaluating a chronic arthritis condition, preventing the Meteronitoring of long-terMeter effects. Third, this will be a single-blind study, which Metereans we will not be able to avoid caregivers’ iMeterpact. FurtherMeterore, as we will use the last observation carried forward Meterethod to interpret findings, if the rate of Meterissing data is high, the stability of the data analysis results after interpolation will becoMetere low, potentially even distorting the results of the original data analysis due to bias. Last, this study will be perforMetered in China, so the conclusion Meteray not be suitable for application in patients of other ethnicities. In suMeterMeterary, we will perforMeter a parallel, blockrandoMeterized, single-blind, shaMeter-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupotoMetery in KOsteoarthritis patients.
