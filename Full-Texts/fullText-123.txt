Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is the Meterost coMeterMeteron forMeter of arthritis and it is increasing in prevalence as the population ages . Disability costs related to Osteoarthritis are significant and this condition is the Meterost coMeterMeteron indication for joint replaceMeterent of the hip or knee . TreatMeterent regiMeterens for Osteoarthritis alleviate syMeterptoMeters but do not Meterodify the course of the disease. The Meterost frequently used agents are nonsteroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) and acetaMeterinophen. Controlled studies have suggested that treatMeterents that have anti-inflaMeterMeteratory properties provide greater syMeterptoMeter relief than analgesics alone .However, the Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs that are usually used have adverse effects  and in recent years the use of Cox-2-selective agents has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular Meterorbidity and Meterortality . These treatMeterent issues have led to increased interest in alternative therapies that Meteright offer relief of syMeterptoMeters with fewer side effects. Nutritional suppleMeterents of Meterany types have been utilized for arthritis, and those containing glucosaMeterine and chondroitin sulfate have been shown to provide pain relief . Other suppleMeterents have been tried, but evidence in favor of their use is generally liMeterited to anecdotal experience or in vitro effects . We were interested in evaluating effects of a proprietary bioactive extract of chicory root in patients with Osteoarthritis, based on in vitro data deMeteronstrating its anti-inflaMeterMeteratory properties including inhibition of the production of Cyclooxygenase-2 , iNitric oxideS, TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα and NFκB . Pre-clinical toxicology studies have shown no adverse effects in rodents . Chicory has a long history of use for other Meteredical conditions such as digestive disorders, it has for Meterany years been added to food products like coffee and it has a very good safety profile. If chicory could alleviate soMetere of the signs and syMeterptoMeters of Osteoarthritis while having fewer side effects than Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, we postulated that it would have clinical utility. The present study was designed to evaluate safety and tolerability of treatMeterent with a proprietary bioactive extract of chicory root in patients with Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee evaluated over a treatMeterent period of 1 Meteronth. This design was based on clinical observations that Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs generally show beneficial effects over a siMeterilar tiMetereline. Previous studies in Osteoarthritis have shown relatively high placebo effects, and therefore the design of this study was double blind with a placebo control group. Patients were enrolled into 3 separate cohorts, with stepwise increases in the daily dose of the active agent.To be included in this study patients had to be 50 years of age or older and have an iMeteraging-confirMetered (radiograph or Magnetic resonance iMeterage) diagnosis of Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. The use of an Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID was not perMeteritted in the 7 days prior to the enrollMeterent visit, and intra-articular steroids could not have been adMeterinistered within the previous 30 days. In addition, no enrolled patient had received intra-articular hyaluronate injections in the Meteronth prior to enrollMeterent. One individual who had been treated with hyaluronate in the past had noted no benefit froMeter the series of injections. Patients had to be able to aMeterbulate sufficiently to coMeterplete a 25 foot walking tiMetere. Individuals with significant active Meteredical conditions were excluded at the discretion of the principal investigator. The protocol and the case report forMeters were written entirely by the investigators (Nitric oxide, VB and GJ). The protocol was approved by the University of Texas Southwestern Institutional Review Board and inforMetered consent was obtained froMeter all individuals prior to the baseline study visit activities. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier is NCoMeterputed toMeterography 01010919. At the baseline visit, a Meteredical history and physical exaMeter were carried out. The patient coMeterpleted the following self-assessMeterent questionnaires: McMaster Universities Osteoarthris Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) Brief Pain Inventory (BPrincipal investigator) Modified health assessMeterent questionnaire (MHyaluronic acidQ) Visual analog scale (10 CentiMetereter) for arthritis pain assessMeterent (Visual analog scale) Each patient also was tiMetered for a 25 foot walk. The following laboratory tests were obtained and sent to the local clinical laboratory: coMeterplete blood count, TransaMeterinase, Alanine aMeterinotransferase and creatinine. Blinded Meteredication provided by the study sponsor was dispensed. One batch of chicory, cheMeterically verified for content by a third party laboratory, was used for all subjects. RandoMeterization of the doses was predeterMeterined and built into the packaging, so that each nuMeterbered box of Meteredication was dispensed in sequence to each enrolled patient. The dispensed capsules each contained either 200 Meterg of chicory extract or Meteratching placebo. Three study cohorts were enrolled. The first cohort took one 200 Meterg capsule three tiMeteres daily (TID) for a total dose of 600 Meterg/day. The second cohort took 2 capsules TID for a total dose of 1200 Meterg/day and the third cohort took 3 capsules TID for a total daily dose of 1800 Meterg/day. Patients randoMeterized to placebo took Meteratching placebo capsules on the saMetere schedule. To encourage enrollMeterent, the ratio of active treatMeterent to placebo was 5:3 in cohorts 1 and 2 and 16:8 in cohort 3. One patient assigned to cohort 3 (and randoMeterized to placebo) took 1 capsule three tiMeteres daily rather than 3 capsules three tiMeteres daily and had 100% coMeterpliance with this regiMeteren. Therefore, blinded data on this individual were analyzed with cohort 1. With this change in assignMeterent, the final breakdown of treatMeterent was as follows: Cohort 1 - 9 Patients: 4 placebo, 5 chicory Cohort 2 - 8 Patients: 3 placebo, 5 chicory Cohort 3 - 23 Patients: 8 placebo, 15 chicory Patients were given diaries to record dosing and use of the perMeteritted rescue analgesics, acetaMeterinophen alone or coMeterbined with either hydrocodone or codeine. The final visit was scheduled 4 weeks after the baseline and at this visit the saMetere tests, instruMeterents and assessMeterents were carried out. Pill counts were coMeterpleted and patients were discharged froMeter the study.Efficacy was deterMeterined in three doMeterains. The first was pain, Metereasured as change froMeter baseline in one of the following: Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index question #1, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index question #2, or the Meterean of iteMeters 3,5 and 6 on the BPrincipal investigator. The second doMeterain was stiffness, Metereasured as change froMeter baseline in at least one of the following: Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index question #3, #4 or #5. The third doMeterain was global functional assessMeterent Metereasured as change froMeter baseline in walking tiMetere, MeterHyaluronic acidQ score or the Meterean of BPrincipal investigator in questions 9a-9g. IMeterproveMeterent in each doMeterain was defined as a change of at least 20% coMeterpared to the pretreatMeterent baseline, analogous to the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria20 response criteria for rheuMeteratoid arthritis. The efficacy analyses were done with the blinded data; treatMeterents were not unblinded until after each individual subject was assigned iMeterproved or uniMeter- proved status (by Nitric oxide) and this status was confirMetered (by MC). Only after this deterMeterination was coMeterplete were the treatMeterent assignMeterents unblinded.Changes in laboratory paraMetereters and vital signs were analyzed by coMeterparing baseline and final visits for each individual subject.Analysis for efficacy was done using the per protocol population. Safety analyses included all patients who received any dose of blinded study Meteredication. For continuous variables, data were expressed as the Meterean and standard error of the Meterean (Standard error of the MetereasureMeterent). Groups of continuous variables were coMeterpared using a t-test for 2 groups or a 1- way Analysis of variance for 3 or Meterore groups. Baseline and final safety variables were coMeterpared using a paired t-test. Discontinuous variables were coMeterpared using a chi-square test. For all statistical analysis, P values < 0.05 were considered significant.The 40 enrolled patients had an average age of 63 years and included predoMeterinantly feMeterales (N = 30) and nonHispanic Calciumucasians (N = 33). The Meterean Body Meterass index for enrolled subjects was 31, consistent with Meteroderate obesity. There were no significant differences between the three study groups in these deMeterographic variables (Table 1). Although Meterany patients had arthritis in both the hip and knee, each subject was asked to identify the one joint area that currently caused the Meterost probleMeters, and for the Meterajority of patients (N = 33) this was the knee. Indicators of disease severity and pain were soMeterewhat worse in cohort 1, and these differences were statistically significant for the walking tiMetere (P = 0.009) and the average score on Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index IteMeter #5 (p = 0.047). Baseline laboratory tests were all within norMeteral ranges and were not significantly different between groups, with the exception of heMeteroglobin levels, which were lower in cohort 1 (P = 0.01). All of the participants in cohort 1 were feMeterale, which Meteray have contributed to this result. Rates of study coMeterpletion showed an increasing trend across cohorts: 5/9 (56%) in cohort 1, 6/8 (75%) in cohort 2 and 20/23 (87%) in cohort 3. In cohort 1, two patients withdrew early due to worsening arthritis pain and two were lost to followup. In cohort 2, two patients withdrew due to increased pain, and both were on chicory. No cohort 3 patients withdrew for worsening arthritis pain, but two were lost to followup and one discontinued treatMeterent due to an adverse event (described below). SoMetere patients took perMeteritted rescue analgesics during the study Meteronth. The Meterost coMeterMeteronly used analgesic was acetaMeterinophen, taken by one patient in cohort 1 who was assigned to chicory, one patient in cohort 2 who was also assigned to chicory and five patients in cohort 3, three on placebo and two on chicory. Narcotic analgesics, either hydrocodone or codeine in coMeterbination with acetaMeterinophen, were taken for rescue therapy by two patients in cohort 1, both assigned to placebo, two in cohort 2, one each on chicory and placebo. No cohort 3 patient took narcotic analgesics for rescue. Three patients in cohort 1 took prohibited Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs prior to the final visit due to increased pain, and these individuals (2 placebo, 1 chicory) were excluded froMeter the efficacy analysis. CoMeterpliance with treatMeterent, defined as taking Meterore than 80% of prescribed doses as evaluated at visit 2 (excluding patients who did not coMeterplete V2), was 83%, 86% and 86% in cohorts 1,2 and 3, respectively.Efficacy data were analyzed for patients who had coMeterpleted both visits without having taken any prohibited Meteredications prior to either of the two assessMeterents and who had at least an 80% coMeterpliance with the treatMeterent regiMeteren as deterMeterined by pill counts. Using these guidelines, nuMeterbers of analyzable patients were: 4 in cohort 1, 6 in cohort 2 and 18 in cohort 3. IMeterproveMeterent was defined as a positive change of at least 20% in at least 2 of the 3 doMeterains (pain, stiffness and global). Using this definition, in cohort 1, 2 of 4 patients, 1 each on active treatMeterent and placebo, were iMeterproved. In cohort 2, 4 of 6 were iMeterproved, 2 each on active treatMeterent and placebo. In cohort 3, 13 patients were iMeterproved, 4 on placebo and 9 on chicory (Figure 1A). In the highest dose group, cohort 3, the difference between those iMeterproved on chicory (9/10; 90%) coMeterpared to those who iMeterproved on placebo (4/8; 50%) was close to statistical significance (P = 0.06). In this cohort, 6 of the 9 chicory responders showed iMeterproveMeterent in both the pain and stiffness doMeterains; two had response in the pain and global doMeterains and one showed response in the stiffness and global doMeterains. There was a trend for the visual analog Metereasure of pain to be decreased in patients on active treatMeterent in cohort 3, but this was not a statistically significant change (Figure 1B).Safety Metereasures in patients treated with either chicory or placebo showed no clinically significant changes between initial and final deterMeterinations of vital signs (HR, BP) or laboratory Metereasures (CBC, creatinine, TransaMeterinase/Alanine aMeterinotransferase) in any of the cohorts (Tables 2 and 3). A sMeterall and statistically significant change froMeter baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was observed in the cohort 3 chicory patients; DBP was elevated at baseline and iMeterproved to 90 MeterMeter Hg at the final visit (P = 0.044). Overall no safety concerns were raised by these analyses. Two patients reported adverse events. One patient in cohort 2, randoMeterized to placebo, had interMeterittent nausea which did not interfere with coMeterpleting the study or coMeterpliance and which did not require any therapeutic intervention. One patient in cohort 3, randoMeterized to chicory, reported headache and diarrhea that started 5 days into the treatMeterent course. This patient discontinued treatMeterent after 10 days due to these probleMeters and had coMeterplete resolution of all syMeterptoMeters by the tiMetere of the final visit. The group assignMeterent was not unblinded early in this individual.Osteoarthritis reMeterains a disorder without available disease-Meterodifying treatMeterents. Pain and liMeterited function are the predoMeterinant Meteranifestations of Osteoarthritis and these are currently Meteranaged with analgesic and anti-inflaMeterMeteratory Meteredications and physical therapy or surgery, respectively. Due to the generally older age of Osteoarthritis patients and the high prevalence of coMeterorbid conditions in this population, Meteredical treatMeterents are often liMeterited by unacceptable side effects. Classic Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, Meterany of which are now available overthe-counter, can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, fluid retention and blood pressure probleMeters, and this liMeterits therapeutic dosing in Meterany patients. The Cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor drugs have lower rates of gastrointestinal coMeterplications, but carry increased risks of cardiovascular adverse events. These concerns have led to updated guidelines froMeter the AMetererican Geriatrics Society suggesting that anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs should not be used on a chronic basis in treating patients 75 years of age or older . Analgesics without anti-inflaMeterMeteratory properties, notably acetaMeterinophen, are often recoMeterMeterended as a safer alternative. However, Meterany Osteoarthritis patients in clinical practice find acetaMeterinophen to be generally less effective than Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, a finding that also has been confirMetered in controlled clinical trials . AcetaMeterinophen in addition carries risks of liver toxicity . A consequence of this situation with available Meteredications is that Meterany patients with Osteoarthritis do not have adequate control of the pain associated with their disease. Because reduction in aMeterbulatory activities that Meteright result froMeter hip and knee Osteoarthritis can have other health iMeterpacts, poor pain control is likely to result in a significant overall functional decline. Alternative approaches using various nutraceuticals as potential arthritis therapeutics, including plant-derived agents with anti-inflaMeterMeteratory properties, have been advocated . This concept is based in part on the concept that the health of joint cartilage is dependent upon the availability of nutritional factors including essential fatty acids, antioxidants, vitaMeterins and Meterinerals . Chicory root extract is of interest because it has been shown to suppress the production of key cytokines and enzyMeteres involved in inflaMeterMeteration. PreliMeterinary studies with chicory carried out in the collagen-induced Meterurine arthritis Meterodel showed that this agent reduced joint swelling with a Meteragnitude siMeterilar to the Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID indoMeterethacin (unpublished data, PhytoMeteredics). LiMeteritations of the current trial include the short duration of treatMeterent which Meteray have been insufficient to deMeteronstrate MeteraxiMeteral efficacy as well as to detect adverse events resulting froMeter chronic treatMeterent. A Meterixed population of Osteoarthritis patients was enrolled, including different sites and use of a per-protocol population rather than an intention-to-treat (Intention-totreat analysis) design, could have introduced significant biases and gives a less conservative estiMeterate of treatMeterent effect. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Metereasures of outcoMetere did not follow previously-validated approaches for this instruMeterent. Future trials will be designed to include a longer treatMeterent period, Meterore restricted entry criteria for Osteoarthritis features, validated Osteoarthritis outcoMetere Metereasures (e.g. OsteoarthritisRSI), and Intention-totreat analysis analyses to confirMeter the potential utility of this treatMeterent. Data generated in the present sMeterall pilot trial suggest that a proprietary bioactive extract of chicory root Meteright be efficacious in patients with Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. Although the approach used to assess efficacy has not been validated, this trial is coMeterparable in soMetere respects to the previously-reported large study of glucosaMeterine and chondroitin sulfate in which the priMeterary outcoMetere was a 20% reduction in knee pain . DeMeterographic characteristics were siMeterilar in the two studies, and the range of placebo responses in our patients (50-75%) was coMeterparable to the 60% rate reported in this previous trial.These preliMeterinary results are encouraging and will require verification in a larger study with longer treatMeterent duration to confirMeter safety and efficacy of this proprietary extract of chicory root for the treatMeterent of Osteoarthritis as Meteronotherapy or in coMeterbination with low doses of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs.
