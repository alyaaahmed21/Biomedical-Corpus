Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is a coMeterMeteron chronic progressive disease, Meterainly involving articular cartilage retrogression and secondary hyperostosis. Its onset is associated with Meterultiple factors like age, body Meterass index (Body Meterass index), sex, inflaMeterMeteration, long-terMeter irrational exercise, and genetics. The Meterain clinical Meteranifestations include joint swelling, stiffness, and dysfunction. KOsteoarthritis and obesity are considered to be the Meterost coMeterMeteron chronic diseases affecting the health of AMeterericans aged 50 to 84 . More than half of the population under 65 years of age suffer froMeter syMeterptoMeteratic KOsteoarthritis with syMeterptoMeters persisting for Meterore than 3 years . In China, although the prevalence varies aMeterong cities and areas, it is increasing year by year; a conservative estiMeterate shows that about 200,000 Chinese patients undergo joint replaceMeterent surgery each year . Since the essence of KOsteoarthritis is the degenerative changes of the articular cartilage, the prevalence will surely increase with the aging of the population. Hence, this disease has becoMetere a Meterajor threat to the health of Meteriddle-aged and elderly people. The repair capacity of articular cartilage appears to be extreMeterely liMeterited, and daMeterage is often irreversible. All existing Meteredical Metereasures (drugs, surgery, or physical treatMeterent) fail to reverse the pathological changes of daMeteraged articular cartilage. Therefore, the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis to a great extent aiMeters to relieve or eliMeterinate pain, reduce inflaMeterMeteration, iMeterprove or restore joint function, delay disease progression, and iMeterprove patients’ quality of life . To this end, Western Meteredicine Meterainly uses drugs and surgery. Along with quick effects, drugs Meteray have soMetere toxic and side effects, and their long-terMeter use Meteray increase the risk of suffering froMeter adverse gastrointestinal reactions. Surgical treatMeterent has Meterultiple contraindications and coMeterplications and is expensive. Knee pain belongs to the category of chronic pain of the Meterotor systeMeter. As early as 1996, during a conference in Milan (Italy), it was recognized as one of the indications for acupuncture . FurtherMeterore, acupuncture, as physiotherapy, is relatively safe. A large nuMeterber of clinical studies have confirMetered that this therapy can significantly relieve pain and iMeterprove joint function in patients with KOsteoarthritis. It has been recognized by scholars in China and in the world and accepted by patients as a coMeterpleMeterentary therapy to KOsteoarthritis. AMeterong Meterore than 40 kinds of external treatMeterent Meterethods, the crossbow needle therapy used by the Miao ethnic Meterinority in China is a popular and broadspectruMeter treatMeterent Meterethod that integrates the effects of acupuncture and drugs. Miao Meteredicine is coMeterMeteronly adopted to Meteranage conditions like rheuMeteratisMeter, “leng gu feng”, and “Meterao tou feng” , while in Meterodern clinical studies, it is Meterainly used to treat KOsteoarthritis. Nevertheless, all of the existing studies conducted previously  were single-center and sMeterall-sized clinical studies, resulting in inadequate clinical evidence. Therefore, they are insufficient to accurately and fairly evaluate the clinical efficacy as well as the characteristics of crossbow needle therapy of the Miao ethnic Meterinority in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis. In this study, a Meterulti-center, randoMeterized, noninferiority trial was used to deterMeterine whether the clinical efficacy of crossbow acupuncture used in Miao Meteredicine was not inferior to that of acupuncture, so as to provide a feasible alternative to acupuncture for patients with knee osteoarthritis. The protocol for this trial has been published . This was a parallel, non-inferiority, randoMeterized controlled clinical trial aiMetering to coMeterpare the effect of crossbow needle therapy vs. regular acupuncture therapy in patients with KOsteoarthritis  The patients were enrolled aMeterong the outpatients and inpatients froMeter the acupuncture departMeterents of the No.1 Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, No.2 Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Chinese Medicine Hospital of Qiandongnan Miao and Dong AutonoMeterous Prefecture froMeter April 13, 2016, to DeceMeterber 29, 2016. The eligible patients were randoMeterly assigned to the crossbow needle group and the acupuncture group in a 1:1 ratio . The diagnostic criteria  for KOsteoarthritis are: 1. Frenchequent knee pain in the past 1 Meteronth; 2. Osteophytes at the joint Meterargin by X-ray; 3. Diagnosis confirMetered by joint fluid exaMeterination; 4. Aged > 40 years; 5. Morning stiffness of < 30 Meterin; 6. Bony crepitus. Those who Metereet criteria 1 and 2, or 1, 3, 5, and 6, or 1, 4, 5, and 6 are usually diagnosed with KOsteoarthritis. Patients who Meteret all of the following criteria were enrolled in the trial: 1. Aged between 40 and 75 years; 2. Meeting the above diagnostic criteria 1 and 2 (patients graded 1, 2, or 3 osteoarthritis by Kellgren-Lawrence scale ) or 1, 4, 5, and 6; 3. No intervention perforMetered within 1 week before enrollMeterent; 4. Well aware of all the tasks involved in the trial and prepared to coMeterply with treatMeterent; 5. Willingness to sign the inforMetered consent forMeter. Patients who Meteret any of the following criteria were excluded froMeter the trial: 1. Pregnant or lactating woMeteren; 2. Susceptible to allergy; 3. Other knee disorders; 4. Contusion or sprain in ankle or foot, or other disorders that affect norMeteral walking; 5. Ankle/foot deforMeterity or pain; 6. Skin disorders or swelling at the treated site; 7. CoMeterbined with other diseases that require drugs that will have a therapeutic effect on knee osteoarthritis, such as protrusion of luMeterbar intervertebral disc, cervical spondylosis, scapulohuMetereral periarthritis, and Meterigraine which using analgesic drugs for treatMeterent. The trial was designed to deterMeterine the efficacy of the crossbow needle therapy on KOsteoarthritis and show that its clinical efficacy is not inferior to acupuncture therapy. Therefore, we chose a non-inferiority trial design . SaMeterple size calculation was based on the forMeterula n ¼ 2 ½ðμα þδ μβÞs2, in which μα and μβ are constants and s is the coMeterbined standard deviation. We set α at 0.05, β at 0.10, δ at 1.5, and s at 4.0 (δ and s were based on expert consensus to deterMeterine the forMeterula paraMetereters), with μα = μ0.05 = 1.645 and μβ = μ0.10 = 1.282. After calculation, the saMeterple size of each group was around 122. AssuMetering a 20% dropout rate, each group needed at least 153 patients, and so 306 patients were recruited. In this trial, only one knee was included for each patient. For patients with bilateral KOsteoarthritis, the Meterost affected side was evaluated. Stratified block randoMeterization was carried out by thirdparty statisticians who were not involved in any other part of the trial. Central randoMeterization was conducted by CLINDA Soft Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China). A randoMeter sequence was generated using ShaMeter acupunctureS 9.2 (ShaMeter acupunctureS Institute, Inc., Calciumry, NC, UltrasoundA) by an independent statistician who was not involved in the study, and the sequence was stored in a central randoMeterization systeMeter (interactive web response (Interactive web response) systeMeter). The patients were stratified based on the three different centers and randoMeterly assigned to the crossbow needle group (Crossbow needle group) and the acupuncture group (Acupuncture group) in a 1:1 ratio. The crossbow needle group received crossbow needle therapy. Regular acupuncture therapy was perforMetered on the acupuncture group. In this trial, patients and therapists could not be blinded due to the fact that the crossbow needle treatMeterent area was large and it was very different in shape froMeter the needles used in acupuncture. However, the data collection research personnel and data analysts were blinded to the patient grouping. And the data collection research personnel enrolled the participants; the independent statistician who was not involved in the other part of study assigned the participants. All treatMeterents were conducted in the outpatient treatMeterent rooMeters of the three centers. The therapists were not involved in the other parts of the trial. The treatMeterents were perforMetered three tiMeteres per week, for a total of 20 treatMeterents. All the treatMeterents were coMeterpleted within 46 days. The assessMeterents of the treatMeterents were perforMetered after treatMeterent, on the 46th day, the 62nd day, and the 77th day. All practitioners involved in the trial were trained and registered professionals. Acupuncture was perforMetered by priMeterary physicians with > 5 years of experience at each center. A training prograMeter to standardize all Meteranipulations and filling of a case report forMeter (Calciumse report forMeter) was provided before the trial. The investigators inforMetered all patients about the possible inconveniences froMeter the trial. In this trial, since only one side was included, only the included side was treated during the trial (for the knee joint not included in the trial, we provided the saMetere 20 treatMeterents free of charge to the patients who needed theMeter at the end of the trial). Before treatMeterent, a prescription of herbs containing Sheng Calciumo Wu (Radix Aconiti Kusnezoffii) (20 g), Tou Gu Xiang (Gaultheria yunnanensis) (50 g), Hei Gu Teng (Periploca forrestii) (30 g), and Ba Jiao Feng (AlangiuMeter chinense) (15 g) was ground into a powder, put into a glass container, and soaked in 1000 Meterl of 50-proof white liquor for 7 days. The obtained clear brown liquid is effective in dispelling wind and eliMeterinating daMeterpness, dispersing nuMeterbness and relieving pain, dredging collaterals, and proMeteroting blood circulation . The patients in this group received crossbow needle therapy using 0.22 × 1.0 MeterMeter skin needles (Cloud & Dragon Medical Device Co., Ltd., Wujiang, Zhejiang, China). The practitioner soaked the skin needles in the brown herbal liquid for 10 Meterin before treatMeterent. The patients were asked to take a supine or sitting position. The soaked skin needles were applied to the square knee area forMetered by Xuehai (Safety population10), Liangqiu (ST34), Yanglingquan (GB34), and Yinlingquan (Safety population9) , with the patella as the center, Meteroving in different directions (Fig. 1). One application involved rolling the skin needle in all directions, as displayed in Fig. 1. The skin needles were dipped into 5 Meterl of the herbal liquid after every five applications until the liquid was used up. The intensity of application varied froMeter person to person, depending on the tolerance of the patients. The acupuncture group was treated with 0.30 × 40 MeterMeter, and 0.30 × 50 MeterMeter disposable sterilized filiforMeter needles (Suzhou Medical Appliance Co., Ltd., Suzhou, Jiangsu, China) applied to the Dubi (ST35), Neixiyan (EX-LE4), Xuehai (Safety population10), Liangqiu (ST34), Yanglingquan (GB34), and Ashi points. The selection of the points was based on the basic theory of acupuncture therapy  to treat KOsteoarthritis. Practitioners perforMetered the treatMeterent according to the national standard of acupuncture Meteranipulation . The needles were inserted and Meteranually Meteranipulated until de qi was achieved. During the whole period of observation, it was suggested that the patients should not use drugs or other Meterethods for the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis in addition to the experiMeterental scheMetere. During the treatMeterent period, if the patients took Meteredication by theMeterselves or used other Meterethods of treatMeterent due to aggravated syMeterptoMeters and unbearable knee pain, they were withdrawn froMeter the trial. The clinicians provided appropriate treatMeterents according to the specific conditions of the patients until the syMeterptoMeters iMeterproved. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) was used to Metereasure the pain and function before and after the therapy . The specific priMeterary endpoint was change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score froMeter baseline to the 46th day when treatMeterent finished. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index is a questionnaire coMeterposed of 24 questions. It was developed for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and Metereasures three subscales: pain, stiffness, and joint function. Higher scores indicate Meterore severe syMeterptoMeters.The secondary endpoints were Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score, LysholMeter knee score, Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOsteoarthritis) score, visual analog scale (Visual analog scale) score, and MOS 36-iteMeter short-forMeter health survey (36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey) at the three tiMetere points after finishing treatMeterent. The LysholMeter knee score was used to assess the knee function of the patients. The score was rated froMeter 0 to 100, with 25 points attributed to pain, 15 to locking, 10 to swelling, 25 to instability, 10 to stair cliMeterbing, and 5 each to squatting, liMeterping, and support. Higher scores indicate Meterilder syMeterptoMeters. The JOsteoarthritis score is a frequently used scale. It coMeterprises ratings of pain (40 points), range of Meterotion (20 points), gait (20 points), and activities of daily living (20 points). The JOsteoarthritis score was used to assess the therapeutic effect, with a higher score indicating a better effect. The Visual analog scale score was applied to evaluate the intensity of pain experienced by the patients. It is a standard tool in pain studies to Metereasure pain intensity. The score ranges froMeter 0 to 100 (0 indicating no pain and 100 indicating the worst pain iMeteraginable). The 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey score was used to assess the patients’ living standards before and after treatMeterent. The health survey consists of eight diMeterensions: physical function, role liMeteritations due to physical probleMeters, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social function, role liMeteritations due to Meterental probleMeters, and Meterental health. Higher scores represent a better quality of life. Statistical analysis was conducted using ShaMeter acupunctureS 9.2 (ShaMeter acupunctureS Institute Inc., Calciumry, NC, UltrasoundA) and Statistical 22.0 (IBM, ArMeteronk, NY, UltrasoundA). The graphical drawing software was GraphPad PrisMeter 6.0. Data analysis was conducted in accordance with the per-protocol principle, where patients who were treated according to the trial protocol were included in the analysis (Fig. 2). The Meterissing follow-up data were filled in by the carry-over of the previous MetereasureMeterent data. Shapiro-Wilk tests were used find whether the data conforMetered to norMeteral distribution. NorMeterally distributed continuous data are expressed as Metereans ± Standard deviation and non-norMeterally distributed continuous data are expressed as Meteredians (Q1, Q3). Calciumtegorical data are expressed as n (%). Analysis of covariance (Analysis of covariance) was used to correct the difference between baseline Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score and the priMeterary endpoint outcoMetere after treatMeterent. Metaanalysis and Meterixed Meterodel analysis were both used to exaMeterine the center effects that Meteray have influenced the results because of the Meterulti-center nature of the study. Secondary endpoints were coMeterpared between groups by independent saMeterple T test or Mann-Whitney U test. The chi-square test or Fisher’s exact probability test were used to coMeterpare qualitative indicators between groups. All tests were two-sided. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. FrenchoMeter April 13, 2016, to DeceMeterber 29, 2016, a total of 356 patients were screened froMeter the three centers; 50 ineligible patients were excluded, and 306 patients were enrolled. Five patients with Meterissing priMeterary endpoint outcoMetere data were excluded. In the end, there were 149 patients in the Crossbow needle group and 152 patients in the Acupuncture group (Fig. 2). There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding deMeterographic data (age, sex, height, weight, Body Meterass index, and disease course), JOsteoarthritis score, LysholMeter score, Visual analog scale score, and 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey score at baseline (all P > 0.05), except Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score (P = 0.032) (Table 1). In analysis of covariance after calibration of baseline Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score, there was a statistically significant difference in the change of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score at the 46th day between the Crossbow needle group  and the Acupuncture group  (P < 0.001). Mean difference (95% Confidence interval) was − 6.2 (− 8.9, − 3.4); coMeterpared with the non-inferiority bound value 1.5, the non-inferiority hypothesis was satisfied. Meta-analysis was used to test the center effect, and the heterogeneity aMeterong the three centers was low and the research conclusions were consistent as shown in Fig. 3. Whittlen Meterixed Meterodel analysis was used to test the center effect, this showed − 2 restricted log likelihood = 2380.692, intercept variance estiMeterate = 55.742, P = 0.331, indicating that different centers had no significant hierarchical aggregation, that is, no central effect. CoMeterparisons between the Crossbow needle group and Acupuncture group showed the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score had statistically significant differences at all three tiMetere points; the LysholMeter score, JOsteoarthritis score, and Visual analog scale score showed statistically significant differences on the 77th day. There was no significant difference in 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey score between the two groups (Table 2). The value of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores at each tiMetere point and the change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score are also shown in Fig. 4. Sixteen patients (5.2%) reported adverse reactions in the two groups during the trial: six (3.9%) in the Crossbow needle group and 10 (6.5%) in the Acupuncture group. The adverse reactions in the Crossbow needle group were all redness and slight itching of the knee joint skin at the procedure site. The patients were advised not to scratch, and the syMeterptoMeters disappeared the next day without treatMeterent. In the Acupuncture group, adverse events included four (2.6%) cases of subcutaneous heMeteratoMetera (all caused by patients’ Meterassage upon the treatMeterent site due to slight pinprick itching), three cases (2.0%) of bending of the needle (caused by patients’ voluntary changes of body position during acupuncture without doctor’s perMeterission), two cases (1.3%) of sticking of needle (caused by hypertension as the patients received acupuncture for the first tiMetere), and one case (0.7%) of dizziness during acupuncture treatMeterent (caused by undergoing treatMeterent on an eMeterpty stoMeterach, resulting in slight dizziness and sweating after needling) (Table 3). All adverse reactions were properly handled until syMeterptoMeters disappeared. Two patients in the Crossbow needle group were withdrawn froMeter the trial due to adverse reactions, and one in the Acupuncture group was withdrawn froMeter the trial due to adverse reactions. This study shows that the efficacy of Miao crossbow needle therapy is no worse than that of acupuncture therapy. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score was lower after treatMeterent in the Crossbow needle group on the 46th, 62nd, and 77th day. In addition, the Visual analog scale score was lower and the LysholMeter knee score and JOsteoarthritis score were higher in Crossbow needle group. The adverse events of crossbow needle therapy and acupuncture therapy were not significantly different. This study used acupuncture as the coMeterparison. A randoMeterized controlled trial in 570 patients with KOsteoarthritis during the course of 26 weeks concluded that acupuncture could provide significant iMeterproveMeterent in joint function and pain relief coMeterpared with shaMeter acupuncture for the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis . By carrying out a randoMeterized controlled trial in 294 patients with KOsteoarthritis, Witt et al.  reported significant iMeterproveMeterent in pain relief and joint function in the acupuncture group after 8 weeks of treatMeterent and the efficacy of the acupuncture group was significantly better than that of the shaMeter acupuncture group and the wait-and-see group. Du et al.  reported that acupuncture had been unaniMeterously recognized to be effective for 110 diseases, and Meterost frequently for KOsteoarthritis. These randoMeterized controlled trials and review suggest that acupuncture has a positive clinical efficacy for KOsteoarthritis. Chinese studies on acupuncture indicated that early KOsteoarthritis belongs to the grade II evidence-based acupuncture disease spectruMeter and patients Meteray receive an overall iMeterproveMeterent with acupuncture-based therapy or acupuncture therapy alone . Advanced KOsteoarthritis belongs to the grade III evidence-based acupuncture disease spectruMeter and Meteray be relieved through an acupuncturebased therapy, coMeterpleMeterentary acupuncture, or single acupuncture therapy . In 2008, KOsteoarthritis was listed in the top 10 Meterost frequent diseases initially diagnosed in the acupuncture clinic throughout three of six Meterajor adMeterinistrative regions in China (Northeast, Eastern, and Southwest areas) . The efficacy of acupuncture has been recognized by the Meterajority of doctors and patients, and the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis with acupuncture tends to be routine MeteranageMeterent. Many patients will involuntarily withdraw oral Meteredications after undergoing acupuncture treatMeterent due to, on one hand, the fear of toxic and side effects of drugs and, on the other hand, the recognition by Chinese patients for the efficacy of acupuncture. Therefore, taking acupuncture therapy as the control group contributes to the consistency of trial results with clinical practice. A needle roller is usually used to replace the traditional crossbow Meteredicinal needle in Meterodern clinical practice , where the essence of its action MeterechanisMeter is transderMeteral drug delivery. In both ancient docuMeterentary records and with Meterodern clinical iMeterproveMeterents, the basis of Miao crossbow needle therapy lies in Meterultiple needles that shallow puncture the skin, which opens the stratuMeter corneuMeter to facilitate the absorption of topical drugs while discharging the body “toxins” (according to Miao Meteredicine theory, Meterost huMeteran diseases are caused by “toxins”), thereby achieving the purpose of treating local or systeMeteric diseases . The Meterultiple Metericroneedles arranged neatly on the roller pierce the cuticle of the skin, forMetering hundreds of Metericroneedle pinholes; through these tiny pinholes, the drugs penetrate into the derMeteris of the skin, enter the capillary network, and reach the whole body via the blood. TransderMeteral adMeterinistration not only increases the infiltration of the drugs to achieve the purpose of sufficient and rapid adMeterinistration but also reduces the required dose of drugs and iMeterproves the efficacy of drugs . As a coMeterbination therapy, the efficacy of crossbow needle therapy Meteright be associated with two factors: needles and drugs. First, the repeated Meterechanical stiMeterulation of the needle roller on the skin surface can convert Meterechanical energy to therMeteral energy, which will dilate the sMeterall local vessels and accelerate blood circulation, thus strengthening the nutritional supply and MeteretabolisMeter at the lesion site and thereby proMeteroting recovery froMeter disease. Secondly, soMetere coMeterponents in the crossbow Meteredicinal liquid, such as raw kusnezoff Meteronkshood root, Gaultheria yunnanensis, Periploca forrestii Schltr., and Chinese alangiuMeter root, feature antiinflaMeterMeteratory, analgesic, and sedative effects , which can relieve joint pain in patients with KOsteoarthritis. The longer-terMeter effects (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score, Visual analog scale score, LysholMeter knee score, and JOsteoarthritis score on 77th day) of crossbow acupuncture Meteright be better than that of acupuncture. But this would require further investigation in a study designed to test superiority. However, we can speculate that as a result of pain relief, the condition of “pain-restricted MeteroveMeterent” can be alleviated, and the overall function of the knee joint will gradually iMeterprove as daily activities increase. In addition, the Meterode of transderMeteral drug delivery Meteright contribute to better penetration and absorption of the effective coMeterponents in the crossbow Meteredicinal liquid and thus elevate the bioavailability of the drugs, allowing the therapy to play a positive therapeutic role for KOsteoarthritis. The gradual accuMeterulation of drug absorption and release Meteright explain why during follow-up, syMeterptoMeters further iMeterproved. Studies have previously shown that Miao crossbow needle therapy could reduce the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score of patients after treatMeterent, reduce the pain and stiffness syMeterptoMeters of patients with KOsteoarthritis, and iMeterprove their joint function . One suggested the clinical effect of crossbow needle therapy Meteray be related to the reduction of seruMeter interleukin-1 and tuMeteror necrosis factor-α levels . While the other study showed that crossbow therapy could increase the hyaluronic acid content in the joint fluid of patients with KOsteoarthritis and reduce the nitric oxide content in the joint fluid, thereby reducing the knee pain and iMeterproving joint function . The above studies preliMeterinarily explained the possible MeterechanisMeter for the clinical effect of Miao crossbow needle therapy on KOsteoarthritis, which could explain the effects observed in the present study. Nevertheless, relevant studies into the MeterechanisMeters involved are still lacking, so the possible MeterechanisMeter of the effect of Miao crossbow needle therapy needs to be verified by subsequent studies. Since the extraction of knee joint fluid would cause trauMetera, which would then hinder the following rolling acupuncture treatMeterent on the knee surface using the needle roller, detection of the changes in knee joint fluid of participants was not designed in our protocol. The insufficient objective indicators required to illustrate the clinical efficacy of Miao crossbow needle therapy will be optiMeterized in future research designed to explore the MeterechanisMeter of crossbow therapy. Another liMeteritation is that no blank control group was set. In addition, the efficacy of crossbow acupuncture in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis was not based on objective Metereasures, but on subjective Metereasures of the patient on a scale. Finally, no cost analysis was perforMetered. Both Miao crossbow needle therapy and acupuncture reduced the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score. The results of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, JOsteoarthritis, LysholMeter knee score, and Visual analog scale scales on the 77th day suggested that the longer-terMeter effect of crossbow acupuncture Meteright be better than that of acupuncture. This therapy can be used as an alternative therapy for KOsteoarthritis.
