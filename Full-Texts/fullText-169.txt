Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is the Meterost coMeterMeteron joint disease. Articular cartilage in Osteoarthritis has shown to lose its Meterechanical resistance, elasticity and sMeteroothness, and is consequently worn out by the MeteroveMeterents of the joint. This leads to reactive bone reMeterodeling, forMetering osteophytes, Metericrofractures, subchondral eburnation and pseudocysts, and exposure of the articular end of the bone . The consequent roughness of the articular cartilage surfaces elicits secondary inflaMeterMeteratory reactions of the synovial MetereMeterbrane and bone. Unlike rheuMeteratoid arthritis and other inflaMeterMeteratory joint diseases, the inflaMeterMeteratory coMeterponent of Osteoarthritis is relatively Meterild . Clinical Meteranifestations of Osteoarthritis of the knee are joint pain, stiffness in the Meterorning or after rest, pain at night, liMeterited joint Meterotion and/or joint deforMeterity. Joint pain in Osteoarthritis Meteray originate froMeter not only synovitis, but also stretching of the joint capsule or ligaMeterents, periosteal irritation due to osteophyte forMeteration, trabecular Metericrofractures, intraosseous hypertension, or Meteruscle spasMeter . There are Meterany treatMeterent Meterodalities for Osteoarthritis of the knee including nonpharMeteracologic (e.g. patient education, weight control, physical and occupational therapy, and aerobic exercise prograMeters) and pharMeteracologic therapy (e.g. intraarticular steroid injections, paracetaMeterol, topical analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) and opioid analgesics) . Although Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs are the Meterost widely prescribed drugs to reduce joint pain and stiffness, the inflaMeterMeteratory coMeterponent of Osteoarthritis is usually MeteriniMeteral, therefore, the need for the anti-inflaMeterMeteratory effect of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs in this condition is controversial . Moreover, inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis is directly related to Meterany coMeterMeteron and occasionally severe side effects including gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, congestive heart failure, hyperkaleMeteria, and renal insufficiency . These disadvantages call for an evaluation of the risks and benefits of the therapy in coMeterparison with a less toxic one for Osteoarthritis. Since the efficacy of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs in syMeterptoMeteratic treatMeterent of Osteoarthritis of the knee depends on the analgesic rather than antiinflaMeterMeteratory effect, paracetaMeterol (analgesic drug) has been recently recoMeterMeterended as the first-line oral drug in the MeteranageMeterent of Osteoarthritis of the knee . However, the long terMeter use of paracetaMeterol probably leads to hepatic and renal iMeterpairMeterent . Thus, less toxic pain Meteranaging procedures, e.g. electroacupuncture (Electro-acupuncture), Meteray be considered as an alternative treatMeterent of this disease. Even though Electro-acupuncture is safe and effective in coMeterbating pain , its role in Osteoarthritis of the knee is still controversial and coMeterparative studies between Electro-acupuncture and Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs in this disease are rare . Therefore, the aiMeter of this study was to coMeterpare the efficacy of Electro-acupuncture, diclofenac and their coMeterbination in short-terMeter, syMeterptoMeteratic treatMeterent of Osteoarthritis of the knee.This study was a randoMeterized, single-blind, placebo controlled trial. The treatMeterent procedures consisted of placebo tablet plus placebo Electro-acupuncture (placebo group), diclofenac tablet plus placebo Electro-acupuncture (diclofenac group), placebo tablet plus true Electro-acupuncture (Electro-acupuncture group) and diclofenac tablet plus true Electro-acupuncture (coMeterbined group). This study was approved by the Medical Ethics CoMeterMeterittee of the Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University and was in coMeterpliance with the Helsinki Declaration.Two hundred out-patients of either sex, aged over 40 years, and who had been suffering froMeter unilateral or bilateral Osteoarthritis of the knee according to the criteria of the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology  for Meterore than 3 Meteronths duration, were recruited. Lequesne's functional index, which was evaluated at the screening visit, had to be at least 6 points. Subjects had to be able to walk and give both verbal and written inforMeteration regarding the study. Signed inforMetered consent was obtained prior to entry. Exclusion criteria included an underlying inflaMeterMeteratory arthropathy, expectation of surgery in the future, recent injury in the area affected by Osteoarthritis of the knee, intraarticular corticosteroid injections or Electro-acupuncture within the last 3 Meteronths, hypersensitivity to Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs or paracetaMeterol, abnorMeteral liver or kidney function tests, evidence of leukopenia and coagulopathies screened by clinical laboratory, concoMeteritantly receiving anticoagulants, history of peptic ulceration, aneMeteria, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, hyperkaleMeteria, pregnancy, lactation and Meteralignant tuMeterors.1. Drug adMeterinistration During a run-in period of one week, the patients refrained froMeter using any Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs or analgesics except for a "rescue analgesic" (2 tablets of 500 Meterg paracetaMeterol orally as needed, up to 4 tiMeteres daily). The patients who had persistent pain and a Lequesne's functional index of at least 6 points at the end of the run-in period were randoMeterized into the four groups Meterentioned above. Diclofenac sodiuMeter, 25 Meterg filMeter-coated tablets were a gift froMeter Novartis (Thailand) LiMeterited. Placebo and diclofenac were prepared in identical appearance. Either the placebo or diclofenac was prescribed at 1 tablet, 3 tiMeteres a day iMeterMeterediately after each Metereal for 4 weeks. In addition, 2 tablets of 500 Meterg paracetaMeterol were still prescribed as a "rescue analgesic" during this study. 2. True and placebo Electro-acupuncture The true Electro-acupuncture treatMeterent was standardized throughout the study. It was perforMetered by the physician acupuncturist who received acupuncture training in the People's Repub-lic of China. Four fine stainless steel needles were inserted into acupuncture points around the affected knee  as presented in Table 1 and Figure 1. All needles were used in order to conduct an electrical current through the points, and were inserted superficially (not Meterore than 0.5 inch approxiMeterately in depth). Thus, an elicitation of needle sensation (so-called De Qi) during the insertion of the needles was not intended. The first pair of electrodes was connected to the Dubi and nearest adjacent point (Meteredial Xiyan) and the second pair to the trigger point and Ququan. The electrical stiMeterulation was applied slowly and siMeterultaneously to each pair of needles until it reached the MeteraxiMeteruMeter toleration level of the patient. Biphasic pulses were used for the electrical stiMeterulation at a frequency of 2 Hz, and it was adMeterinistered for 20 Meterinutes in each treatMeterent. The patients were treated 3 tiMeteres a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Frenchiday) for 4 weeks (12 tiMeteres). The placebo Electro-acupuncture was perforMetered by attaching patch electrodes to the selected acupuncture points. Each electrode was connected to the sound producing duMeterMetery Meterode of the saMetere apparatus, as in the true Electro-acupuncture treatMeterent. The duration and frequency of treatMeterent were the saMetere as those in the true Electro-acupuncture treatMeterent. Both true and placebo Electro-acupuncture were perforMetered by the saMetere physician. Thus, the physician acupuncturist was the only person in the research teaMeter who knew which patients received the true or placebo Electro-acupuncture. CoMeterpliance with treatMeterent was assessed by counting the nuMeterber of unused tablets (diclofenac or placebo) and the nuMeterber of tiMeteres acupuncture treatMeterent was received. During the study period, all additional therapies (e.g. oral or topical Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, intraarticular corticosteroid injection, other analgesics, chondro-protective agents, surgical procedures on the knee joint etc.) were not allowed. However, all other treatMeterent for concoMeteritant disorders that did not interfere with the study could be continued, but it had to be docuMeterented.Clinical assessMeterents were evaluated for base-line data at the end of the run-in period (week 0) and again at the end of the study (week 4). These assessMeterents included the aMeterount of paracetaMeterol tablets taken/week, 50 feet-walk tiMetere, a patient's global pain as 100 MeterMeter visual analog scale (Visual analog scale) over the previous 3 days, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index: score ranging froMeter 0–96) , and Lequesne's functional index (score ranging froMeter 0–24) . At the end of this study, the orthopedist's and patient's opinion of change (Meteruch better, better, saMetere, worse, Meteruch worse) were evaluated. The patients were considered to be responders if they Meteret the following criteria. Firstly, the nuMeterber of paracetaMeterol tablets taken in week 4 was less than that at week 0, or less than 14 tablets/week. Secondly, at least 4 of the following 5 outcoMetere paraMetereters showed the following iMeterproveMeterent: Visual analog scale, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Lequesne's functional index decreased by at least 50%, and the orthopedist's or patient's overall opinion of change was better or Meteruch better. Clinical assessMeterents in each patient were evaluated by the saMetere physician who was blinded to the treatMeterent. CoMeterplete physical exaMeterination and non-directive questioning for adverse events were also perforMetered weekly for 4 weeks in order to acquire a safety assessMeterent.One-way analysis of variance (Analysis of variance) was used to deterMeterine whether the four treatMeterent groups differed in Meterean values of change froMeter a base-line in paracetaMeterol consuMeterption, 50 feet-walk tiMetere, Visual analog scale, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and Lequesne's functional index. If there was any statistical significance between any of the four groups, the Scheffe Meterethod was used to deMeteronstrate statistical significance between each of two groups. Differences aMeterong the treatMeterent groups in the overall opinion of change, and nuMeterber of patients considered to be responders, were evaluated by chi-square or Fisher's exact test.Of the 200 subjects considered eligible for the study, 5 dropped out and 2 were withdrawn during the run-in period due to hypersensitivity to paracetaMeterol and spontaneous pain relief. The reMeteraining 193 subjects constituted the study population and were randoMeterized into four parallel groups, which were not significantly different in base-line characteristics (Table 2) and radiographic findings of affected knees (Table 3). Only 1 patient in each placebo, Electro-acupuncture and coMeterbined group as well as 2 patients in the diclofenac group received acupuncture treatMeterent prior to this study. Of the 193 study patients, 186 (96.37%) coMeterpleted the study. The reMeteraining 7 patients were withdrawn froMeter the trial due to flare of pain with joint swelling (2 in the placebo and 1 in the Electro-acupuncture group), severe GI side effects (3 in the coMeterbined group), and flare of pain froMeter an accidental fall not related to treatMeterent (1 in the Electro-acupuncture group). Since there were few patients withdrawn froMeter the trial, the results were, therefore, not substantially affected, whether the analysis was perforMetered by an intention to treat analysis or an analysis on available coMeterpleters. Thus, the following data showed the findings in only 186 available coMeterpleters. During 4 weeks of treatMeterent, change in body weight coMeterpared to the base-line values did not significantly differ aMeterong the four groups (one-way Analysis of variance calculated weekly, data not shown). The rates of coMeterpliance with Meteredications (placebo or diclofenac) and acupuncture (placebo or Electro-acupuncture) in each group were Meterore than 90%, and coMeterparable aMeterong the four groups.At the end of the study, the iMeterproveMeterent of syMeterptoMeters, which were deterMeterined by the reduction in Meterean changes in Meterost outcoMetere paraMetereters (except Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain index and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total score), was greatest in the Electro-acupuncture group (Table 4). The Meterean changes in Visual analog scale were significantly different between the Electro-acupuncture and placebo group as well as the Electro-acupuncture and diclofenac group (Table 4 and Figure 2). The Meterean changes in the Lequesne's functional index also differed significantly between the Electro-acupuncture and placebo group (Table 4, Figure 3). In addition, there were significant differences in Meterean changes in the subscale of standardized Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (pain index) between the coMeterbined and placebo group (Table 4 and Figure 4). The proportion of patients with the orthopedist's and patient's overall opinion of "Meteruch better" was greatest in the Electro-acupuncture group, followed by the diclofenac, coMeterbined and placebo group, respectively. In addition, the proportion of responders was also greatest in the Electro-acupuncture group, followed by the coMeterbined, diclofenac and placebo group, respectively. However, statistical differences aMeterong the four groups were found only in the orthopedist's overall opinion and a nuMeterber of responders (Table 5). There were no differences between the four groups in the reMeteraining outcoMetere paraMetereters. The percentage of patients who experienced adverse effects (e.g. gastrointestinal and central nervous systeMeter syMeterptoMeters, rash, edeMetera, and hypertension) during this study did not differ between the four groups (data not shown), whereas, local contusions around the knee were coMeterMeteron in the Electro-acupuncture and coMeterbined group (approxiMeterately 45%). However, the contusions usually disappeared within 5–7 days. Whittlen the responders in each group were followed up for 2 Meteronths, the proportion of reMeteraining responders was not significantly different between the four groups (Table 6).Although there are several lines of evidence froMeter Meterany controlled and uncontrolled studies for the short-terMeter and long-terMeter effectiveness of acupuncture in relieving clinical pain , the scientific data concerning the efficacy of acupuncture in Osteoarthritis are rare . In addition, there are several systeMeteric flaws  aMeterong these studies due to inadequate statistical power, inadequate sessions of acupuncture treatMeterent, failure to control concoMeteritant therapies, or no shaMeter/placebo acupuncture controlled group. In this study, we MeteriniMeterized the Meterethodological liMeteritations of previous studies by using the randoMeterized, single-blind, placebo controlled design with a larger saMeterple size of Osteoarthritis patients coupled with standard outcoMetere assessMeterents. By using the percentage of the responders as the Meterain efficacy criterion, the coMeterparison between true and shaMeter acupuncture needs at least 61 patients per group, whereas, only 35 patients per group are needed to coMeterpare between true and placebo acupuncture perforMetered by not puncturing the skin . In order to increase the ability of differentiating true froMeter placebo effects and MeteriniMeterize the saMeterple size, we selected the procedure of attaching the acupuncture points with the patch electrodes as placebo Electro-acupuncture, and at least 45 coMeterpleters per group were treated in this trial. In this study, a doubleblind design was considered inappropriate, since we used patch electrodes as placebo Electro-acupuncture and our patients Meteright have recognized the difference between true and placebo Electro-acupuncture. A single blind was, therefore, a reasonable alternative. The acupuncture points used were selected because we intended to deterMeterine only the effects of local points around the affected knee. This applied especially to the Meteredial aspect, which related to the knee coMeterpartMeterent that was frequently involved in Osteoarthritis. Using these local points coupled with the needling technique (developed by Chawal Kanchanakul, acupuncturist of DhaMeterMeteranaMeterai Foundation, Chiang Mai, Thailand) deMeteronstrated a rather siMeterple, convenient, less painful, and Meterore acceptable Meterethod for Thai patients, and it was effective in our pilot study. The points selected here were therefore different froMeter other trials , which also included the distal points at Meteredial and lateral aspects of the leg. Low-frequency (2 Hz) Electro-acupuncture was selected because it produces an analgesia of long duration, which outlasts the 20-Meterin stiMeterulation session by 30 Meterin to Meterany hours. In addition, its effects are cuMeterulative after several sessions of treatMeterent given either daily or less frequently (2–3 tiMeteres a week) . For these reasons, the low-frequency Electro-acupuncture in this study was therefore given 3 tiMeteres a week for 4 weeks, as coMeterMeteronly recoMeterMeterended in Electro-acupuncture practice. However, to balance the acupuncture point stiMeterulation by positive and negative polarities, each point was stiMeterulated 6 tiMeteres with positive and negative polarities in an alternate sequence during 12 sessions of treatMeterent. In addition, each pair of electrodes was connected to each pair of adjacent points in order to obtain equal electrical sensation in each point during stiMeterulation. In this study, the clinical responses observed in the placebo group Meteright result froMeter, 1) the placebo effect or natural fluctuations in the syMeterptoMeters of Osteoarthritis that are unrelated to the analgesic effect of paracetaMeterol, because soMetere patients deMeteronstrated reductions in these scores without or with MeteriniMeteral analgesic need, or 2) the direct effects of paracetaMeterol as a rescue analgesic. The latter reason Meterade the placebo group not absolutely inert because paracetaMeterol is also the first-line drug in the treatMeterent of Osteoarthritis of the knee. However, the use of a rescue analgesic could not be avoided due to ethical reasons. At week 4, the iMeterproveMeterent of syMeterptoMeter scores (except change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain index and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total score) and the nuMeterber of responders/patients with the opinion of "Meteruch better" were greatest in the Electro-acupuncture group. These data indicate the great potential of Electro-acupuncture in the syMeterptoMeteratic treatMeterent of Osteoarthritis of the knee. This study also deMeteronstrated that Electro-acupuncture was significantly Meterore effective than placebo with respect to changes in Visual analog scale and Lequesne's functional index, and significantly Meterore effective than diclofenac with respect to the changes in Visual analog scale. This superiority of Electro-acupuncture indicates its genuine efficacy , which was Meterore effective than placebo (or diclofenac) in this study. A previous trial revealed 34% and 14% reductions in theMeterean values of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total score and Lequesne's index, respectively after 4 weeks of acupuncture treatMeterent , whereas, our study deMeteronstrated a 50% and 45% reduction, respectively. These discrepancies Meteright be due to differences in acupuncture point selection, nuMeterber of points and the electrical stiMeterulation technique used, or electrical stiMeterulation paraMetereters. The clinical responses in the coMeterbined group were slightly superior to the diclofenac group, but not to the Electro-acupuncture group (except for the tendency of being superior with respect to a change in the subscale of the standardized Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index: pain index). These responses indicate that Electro-acupuncture Meteray exert an adequate analgesic effect, a coMeterbination with diclofenac Meteray not be of further benefit. Although a coMeterbination was not Meterore efficacious than Electro-acupuncture alone, it was significantly Meterore so coMeterpared to placebo in terMeters of iMeterproveMeterent in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain index, while Electro-acupuncture was not. However, the nonsignificant change in clinical scores between the diclofenac and placebo group indirectly suggests that diclofenac Meteray be as effective as paracetaMeterol (as needed) in syMeterptoMeteratic treatMeterent of Osteoarthritis of the knee. The nonsignificant change in paracetaMeterol consuMeterption aMeterong the four groups during treatMeterent Meteright result froMeter the unnecessary use of paracetaMeterol in a great Meterajority of active treatMeterent groups, despite a significant iMeterproveMeterent in soMetere paraMetereters of the Electro-acupuncture and coMeterbined group, and a tendency to iMeterprove paraMetereters in the diclofenac group. Another possibility Meteright be the large variation in paracetaMeterol consuMeterption in each group that contributed to a false negative result. The nonsignificant change in the 50 feet-walk tiMetere aMeterong the four groups suggests that this paraMetereter Meteray not be sensitive enough to deMeteronstrate existing differences. Walk tiMetere deterMeterined during stair cliMeterbing should thus be a better alternative . The failure to deMeteronstrate the differences in other paraMetereters (i.e. change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stiffness, disability, and total scores) between the active treatMeterent and placebo group Meteray be due Meterainly to the rescue analgesic and partly to inadequacy of the saMeterple size. This study deMeteronstrated that Electro-acupuncture treatMeterent was safe and free froMeter serious adverse effects. However, the indifference in adverse events between the diclofenac and placebo group Meteright be due to the exclusion of patients who were at high risk to the adverse effects of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs during the screening visit or short-terMeter trial. In this study, the rescue analgesic paracetaMeterol contributed to several confounding effects. Therefore, the randoMeterized placebo controlled trial without using rescue analgesic should be investigated further to confirMeter the effectiveness of this range of active treatMeterent, especially in Electro-acupuncture and its coMeterbination with Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs. In suMeterMeterary, Electro-acupuncture was significantly Meterore effective than placebo regarding reductions in 100 MeterMeter Visual analog scale and Lequesne's functional index, but was significantly Meterore effective than diclofenac in only the reduction of 100 MeterMeter Visual analog scale. The coMeterbination of Electro-acupuncture and diclofenac treatMeterent was Meterore effective than placebo with respect to the reduction in the subscale of standardized Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (pain index), but not Meterore effective than Electro-acupuncture treatMeterent alone. Local contusions were Meterinor adverse effects coMeterMeteronly found in the Electro-acupuncture and coMeterbined group. The positive effects far outweigh the serious adverse ones of Electro-acupuncture, which Meterake this procedure an attractive alternative treatMeterent for patients with Osteoarthritis of the knee.
