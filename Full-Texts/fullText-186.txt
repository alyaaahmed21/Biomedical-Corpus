Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is the Meterost frequent joint disorder with a worldwide increase over the past few years . Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is the Meterost coMeterMeteron type and is encountered in 6% of adults, with a prevalence reaching 40% in advanced age (>70 years) . KOsteoarthritis is a degenerative disease characterized by biocheMeterical and its changes in articular cartilage . Te Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent is Meterost frequently afected in knee Osteoarthritis due to its association with a Meteretaphyseal varus MeteralalignMeterent leading to raised loading on the Meteredial articular surface . High tibial osteotoMetery (High tibial osteotomy), as a classic KOsteoarthritis step surgical treatMeterent with good clinical efect, is a widely accepted procedure to treat varus alignMeterent of the knee associated with Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent arthrosis/overload . More iMeterportantly, there is increasing clinical evidence that the surface of exposed subchondral bone Meteray be regenerated and covered with fbrous cartilage under decoMeterpression after osteotoMetery . Terefore, High tibial osteotomy not only corrects the bioMeterechanics of articular cartilage, but also iMeterproves the Meterechanical environMeterent of cartilage regeneration, which indirectly plays a biocheMeterical advantage to soMetere extent. In fact, the daMeteraged articular cartilage has a very weak self-regeneration and repair capacity . But the regeneration and anti-infaMeterMeteratory efects of plateletrich plasMetera (Platelet-rich plasma) play an iMeterportant biocheMeterical role in cartilage repair . At present, used in isolation or in coMeterbination intra-articular injection of Platelet-rich plasma has been widely used in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis, and its clinical evaluation has been signifcantly iMeterproved coMeterpared with that before treatMeterent . Terefore, in view of the obvious biocheMeterical advantages of Platelet-rich plasma, this study proposed a new scheMetere for the clinical treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis: based on high tibial osteotoMetery, coMeterbined with intra-articular injection of Platelet-rich plasma. Teoretically, Platelet-rich plasma will play a catalytic role in the process of cartilage regeneration after High tibial osteotomy, and the coMeterbination of these two treatMeterents should have an augMeterentation efect on the therapeutic efect of KOsteoarthritis. Terefore, the purpose of our study is to explore the clinical efcacy of the addition of coMeterbined Platelet-rich plasma to High tibial osteotomy in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis.Te study had ethical approval and all patients gave inforMetered consent. Te inclusion criteria were: (1) Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent arthritis; (2) chronic joint pain >12 Meteronths, with no signifcant efect of non-operative treatMeterent; (3) X-ray evaluation of articular cartilage daMeterage were consistent with Kllgren-Lawrence (Kllgren-Lawrence) grade 3/4; (4) arthroscopic evaluation of articular cartilage daMeterage was consistent with International Calciumrtilage Repair Society (International Calciumrtilage Repair Society) grade 3/4. Te exclusion criteria were: (1) age>65 years old; (2) coMeterbined with severe lateral coMeterpartMeterent arthritis or patellofeMeteroral arthritis; (3) fexion contracture greater than 15°; (4) coMeterbined with rheuMeteratoid arthritis, gouty arthritis, trauMeteratic arthritis; previous history of knee surgery, physiotherapy or intra-articular injection within 6 Meteronths, anticoagulant or iMeterMeterunosuppressant within 3 Meteronths; accoMeterpanied by diabetes Meterellitus, severe cardiovascular disease, coagulation dysfunction, iMeterMeterune systeMeter diseases, hepatopathy, infections or tuMeterors. Tis was a double-blinded, randoMeterized, placebocontrolled trial with 3 groups receiving 3 diferent lines of treatMeterent (1 group serving as placebo controls). Te participants were randoMeterly divided by coMeterputer derived randoMeter charts into 3 groups: 25 participants in group A (25 knees) received a treatMeterent option of High tibial osteotomy coMeterbined with Platelet-rich plasma, 27 participants in group B (27 knees) received a treatMeterent prograMeter of High tibial osteotomy coMeterbined with hyaluronic acid (Hyaluronic acid), and 25 participants in group C (25 knees) received a treatMeterent Meterethod of High tibial osteotomy coMeterbined with norMeteral saline (Normal saline) (physiological control/placebo). RandoMeterization ensured that the baseline characteristics of the 3 groups were coMeterparable with age, sex, weight, height, body Meterass index (Body Meterass index), and Kllgren-Lawrence grade. Of the 25 patients in group A, 1 patient was excluded as he underwent total knee replaceMeterent (TKnee replaceMeterent) elsewhere; Of the 27 patients initially in group B, 1 patient was lost, and 1 patient was excluded as he was diagnosed with a Meteralignant tuMeteror during follow-up. Te Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) fowchart showing the selection of patients is shown in Fig. 1. For clinical evaluation, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) score and the visual analog scale (Visual analog scale) were Metereasured preoperatively and at the fnal follow-up (12 Meteronths after High tibial osteotomy). Initial arthroscopy was perforMetered at the tiMetere of High tibial osteotomy, and a second-look arthroscopy was perforMetered at the tiMetere of plate reMeteroval (12 Meteronths after High tibial osteotomy), and the status of articular cartilage was assessed according to the International Calciumrtilage Repair Society grade. Calciumrtilage regeneration was also evaluated by the presence of newly forMetered cartilaginous tissue. In addition, Magnetic resonance iMeterage was coMeterpleted of each joint to Metereasure the cartilaginous thickness of the Meteredial feMeteroral condyle.An arthroscopy was routinely perforMetered before High tibial osteotomy to evaluate the Meteredial and lateral cartilage. High tibial osteotomy was perforMetered using the biplanar opening-wedge technique with rigid plate fxation  (Fig. 2). Te aMeterount of angular correction was planned preoperatively aiMetering to achieve 5 degrees tibiofeMeteroral Meterechanical valgus in a one-leg standing radiograph postoperatively . All patients’ operations were perforMetered by the saMetere senior surgeon. Patients started a postoperative rehabilitation prograMeter including isoMeteretric quadriceps exercise and range-of-Meterotion exercise the day after surgery. A nonweight-bearing regiMeteren was prescribed for 1 week, followed by partial weight-bearing exercise. Te full weight-bearing exercise was perMeteritted 4 weeks postoperatively. Calciumsts or supportive devices were never applied.Autologous Platelet-rich plasma was prepared according to the Meterethod of Landesberg . A total of 50 MeterL venous blood was extracted and centrifuged 2 tiMeteres to obtain about 5 MeterL Platelet-rich plasma, of which 3 MeterL was used for intra-articular injection therapy, and the rest was used for platelet count. Te Meterean platelet count achieved by our Meterethod was 142.14× 104 /uL. Te efective concentration liMeterit of Platelet-rich plasma in the huMeteran body is (50.30~172.90)× 104 /uL . Whittlen the platelet concentration exceeds 180.00× 104 / uL, its ability to proMeterote tissue regeneration and repair is signifcantly weakened, and even shows an inhibitory efect . Marx et al. believe that platelet-rich plasMetera with a platelet concentration of about 4~5 tiMeteres (120.00~150.00× 104 /uL) has a positive efect on articular cartilage . None of the groups knew how Meteruch blood was extracted, as they were instructed to look the other way during extraction; only 5 MeterL of blood was extracted in the control group and was subjected to routine testing. Te patient was placed in a supine position with the afected knee in slight fexion. Under aseptic conditions, 3 MeterL of autologous Platelet-rich plasma, Hyaluronic acid,or Normal saline was uniforMeterly injected into the articular cavity through the Meteredial articular space of the patellar tendon below the patella. If there is Meterore efusion in the articular cavity, part of the efusion can be drawn out frst. After the injection, the patient was assisted to Meterove the knee joint slowly several tiMeteres and told to rest for 10 Meterin. Te treatMeterent was frst perforMetered 1 week after High tibial osteotomy, which was requested again at intervals of 1 week for a total of four consecutive tiMeteres. During the follow-up period, nonsteroidal anti-infaMeterMeteratory drugs were not allowed, and paracetaMeterol (dosage, 500 Meterg TDS) was prescribed in case of discoMeterfort; all patients were asked to stop Meteredications 48 h before follow-up assessMeterent.Te Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score is a widely used Metereasure of a patient’s subjective assessMeterent of pain, joint Meterobility and physical disability . Te Visual analog scale is a widely used Metereasure of a patient’s subjective assessMeterent of pain . Te grade of cartilage injury associated with degeneration was recorded pre-and post-operatively in each coMeterpartMeterent according to the International Calciumrtilage Repair Society grade : Grade 0, norMeteral; Grade 1, softening of the articular cartilage and superfcial lacerations and fssures; Grade 2, fragMeterentation and fssuring that extends <50% of the articular cartilage thickness; Grade 3, fragMeterentation and fssuring that extends >50% of the articular cartilage thickness; and Grade 4, coMeterplete loss of articular cartilage thickness. Postoperative cartilage regeneration was also evaluated using a Meterodifed classifcation of the Meteracroscopic staging systeMeter described by Koshino et al. : Grade 1, no regenerative change; Grade 2, white scattering with fbrocartilage; Grade 3, partial coverage with fbrocartilage; and Grade 4, even coverage with fbrocartilage. Te intra and interobserver reliabilities of arthroscopic evaluation (International Calciumrtilage Repair Society grade and stage of articular cartilage repair) were assessed by weighted kappa coefcients. Magnetic resonance iMeterage was coMeterpleted with 1.5T standard protocols of each individual joint in the coronal sagittal and transverse plane. MaxiMeteruMeter thickness of cartilage at posterior/ Metereniscal and patellar level Metereasured at Meterid-sagittal thru Meteredial condyle was taken into account. Te Meteredial feMeteroral cartilage of the afected knee was selected for MetereasureMeterent. Tree regions of the Meteredial feMeteroral condyle were identifed at the anterior patella feMeteroral, Metereniscal and posterior condyle levels. Te point has a MeteraxiMeteruMeter thickness in the sagittal section passing thru the Meteriddle was identifed for MetereasureMeterent . All data were Metereasured using Sante DICOM Viewer Frenchee (64-bit) version 5.2 (Santesoft, Inc. Athens, Greece), which has an accuracy of 0.01° for angles and 0.01 MeterMeter for distance . In order to MeteriniMeterize errors of MetereasureMeterent, all MetereasureMeterents were perforMetered under the saMetere conditions by two orthopedic surgeons. After an interval of two weeks, one Metereasured the saMeterples again and the intra and interobserver reliabilities were deterMeterined using intra-class correlation coefcients (Intra-class correlation coefficients) (Figs. 3 and 4). Our saMeterple size was based upon an assuMetered study power of 80% (β=0.2), a false-positive rate of 5% (α=0.05), and a predicted diference of 1.5 points on our Visual analog scale (standard deviation, ±1.5) 24. Using these paraMetereters, and adjusting our α for Meterultiple coMeterparisons, we required approxiMeterately 21 patients per treatMeterent arMeter. Statistical analysis was perforMetered using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (Statistical) version 16.0 (Statistical, Chicago, Illinois). Te KolMeterogorov–SMeterirnov test was used to test the norMeterality of nuMetererical data. Levene’s test was used to assess the hoMeterogeneity of the data. All nuMetererical variables showed a norMeteral distribution or equal variance. Diferences for all three groups (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score, Visual analog scale score and the cartilaginous thickness of Meteredial feMeteroral condyle) were analyzed using the analysis of variance (Analysis of variance). Te association of various categorical/classifed data (arthroscopic evaluation, including the International Calciumrtilage Repair Society grade and the stage of articular cartilage repair), within the three groups was analyzed using Pearson’s chi-squared test. NuMetererical data are shown as Meterean and standard deviation, and categorical/classifed data as nuMeterbers with percentages. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically signifcant.Te baseline characteristics, including age, sex, weight, height, Body Meterass index, and Kllgren-Lawrence grade, within the three groups were no statistically signifcant diferences (P>0.05, Table 1) (Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). Tere was no signifcant statistical diference in all preoperative assessMeterents (including Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score, Visual analog scale score, the cartilaginous thickness of Meteredial feMeteroral condyle and International Calciumrtilage Repair Society grade), suggesting that the data within the three groups were coMeterparable (P>0.05, Tables 2, 4, and 6 and Figs. 3 and 5). Te intra and interobserver reliabilities of arthroscopic evaluation (International Calciumrtilage Repair Society grade and stage of articular cartilage repair) and MetereasureMeterent data (cartilaginous thickness of Meteredial feMeteroral condyle) were >0.8. CoMeterpared with preoperative evaluation, the fnal followup results of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score and Visual analog scale score within the three groups were signifcantly iMeterproved (P<0.001). At the fnal follow-up, these paraMetereters were not signifcantly diferent between Group B and C, such as the Pain (Group B, 6.35 (Standard deviation 1.14); Group C, 6.22 (Standard deviation 1.09); p>0.05), the Stifness (Group B, 2.53 (Standard deviation 0.75); Group C, 2.58 (Standard deviation 0.77); p>0.05), the Physical function (Group B, 20.08 (Standard deviation 4.11); Group C, 21.30 (Standard deviation 4.74); p>0.05), the Total score (Group B, 28.96 (Standard deviation 5.75); Group C, 30.10 (Standard deviation 6.52); p>0.05) and the Visual analog scale score (Group B, 3.24 (Standard deviation 0.67); Group C, 3.21 (Standard deviation 0.64); p>0.05) (Table 3 and Fig. 4). But coMeterpared to Group B and C, the fnal follow-up results of Group A were signifcantly diferent (P<0.001), such as the Pain 3.22 (Standard deviation 0.85), Stifness 1.43 (Standard deviation 0.69), the Physical function 13.89 (Standard deviation 2.70), the Total score 18.54 (Standard deviation 4.17) and the Visual analog scale score 1.72 (Standard deviation 0.53) (Table 3 and Fig. 4).CoMeterpared with preoperative evaluation, the fnal followup results of cartilaginous thickness of Meteredial feMeteroral condyle within the three groups were signifcantly iMeterproved (P<0.001). At the fnal follow-up, these paraMetereters were not signifcantly diferent between Group B and C, such as the AnteroposteriorFR (Group B, 2.78 (Standard deviation 0.42); Group C, 2.81 (Standard deviation 0.45); p>0.05), the Anterior meniscal region (Group B, 0.76 (Standard deviation 0.11); Group C, 0.81 (Standard deviation 0.13); p>0.05), the Posterior meniscal region (Group B, 0.82 (Standard deviation 0.12); Group C, 0.85 (Standard deviation 0.14); p>0.05) and the Posterior condyle region (Group B, 1.89 (Standard deviation 0.28); Group C, 1.91 (Standard deviation 0.27); p>0.05) (Table 5 and Fig. 6). But coMeterpared to Group B and C, the fnal follow-up results of Group A were signifcantly diferent (P<0.001), such as the AnteroposteriorFR 3.52 (Standard deviation 0.47), the Anterior meniscal region 1.16 (Standard deviation 0.24), the Posterior meniscal region 1.24 (Standard deviation 0.26) and the Posterior condyle region 2.25 (Standard deviation 0.31) (Table 5 and Fig. 6). Preoperative and postoperative assessMeterents of cartilage daMeterage using the International Calciumrtilage Repair Society grade are suMeterMeterarized in Tables 6 and 7. Calciumrtilage status was signifcantly iMeterproved in both the MFlexion contracture and the Muscle thicknessC after High tibial osteotomy (P < 0.001). At the fnal follow-up, the status of cartilage daMeterage was not signifcantly diferent between Group B and C (P > 0.05); But coMeterpared to Group B and C, the cartilage status of Group A was signifcantly different (P < 0.001), whose cartilage daMeterage was signifcantly reduced. Evaluation of cartilage regeneration by the presence of newly forMetered cartilaginous tissue at second-look arthroscopy is suMeterMeterarized in Table 8. At the fnal follow-up, cartilage regeneration was Meterore obvious in Group A coMeterpared with Group B and C (P < 0.001). Articular cartilage repair of the feMeterur in Group A was observed in all patients (100%), where 6 knees (25%) showed Grade 2 regeneration, 10 knees (42%) showed Grade 3, and 8 knees (33%) showed Grade 4 regeneration. Articular cartilage repair of the tibia in Group A was also observed in all patients (100%), where 8 knees (33%) showed Grade 2 regeneration, 11 knees (46%) showed Grade 3, and 5 knees (21%) showed Grade 4 regeneration. Te Meterain fnding of this study was that the addition of coMeterbined Platelet-rich plasma to High tibial osteotomy Meteray be a Meterore reasonable choice to relieve knee pain and decelerate the progression of the Meteredial KOsteoarthritis. CoMeterpared with pre-treatMeterent, the knee function scores (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and Visual analog scale score) of all patients within the 3 groups were signifcantly iMeterproved, which is closely related to the obvious bioMeterechanical advantages of High tibial osteotomy. Tis is achieved by shifting the Meterechanical axis towards the lateral coMeterpartMeterent with a slight over-correction to of-load the Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent, resulting in relieving knee pain and decelerating the progression of the Meteredial Osteoarthritis . Te Meterulticentric follow-up results of FloerkeMetereier  revealed the good-to-excellent patientreported functional outcoMetere after valgus High tibial osteotomy in varus osteoarthritis with a Meterean OKS of 43, even in older patients with a higher degree of Meteredial cartilage daMeterage. For the severe Meteredial Osteoarthritis of Kllgren-Lawrence grade 3/4, Schuster P  noted that the knee function score was high at a 10-year follow-up after High tibial osteotomy, and the 10-year survival rate could reach 81.7%. In our study, both X-ray and arthroscopic evaluations of articular cartilage daMeterage were serious preoperatively, but the knee function scores were signifcantly iMeterproved after High tibial osteotomy, which was consistent with the above conclusions. Overall, the Meterid- and long-terMeter results of High tibial osteotomy are cited as good, with reduction in pain and facilitation of increased activity, particularly with the developMeterent of specifc fxation devices and osteotoMetery techniques . A Metereta-analysis  indicated that the 10-year survival rate of Meterore than 600 cases after High tibial osteotomy could reach 91.5% and the lifelong revision rate of osteotoMetery was about 35%, so Meterost patients did not even need joint replaceMeterent. Te decoMeterpression of the Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent after High tibial osteotomy could provide a good Meterechanical environMeterent for cartilage regeneration . It has been reported in the relevant literature that even in the cases of full-thickness cartilage daMeterage, up to 78% of the patients will show the phenoMeterenon of cartilage regeneration after osteotoMetery . But the ability of articular cartilage to repair itself is very liMeterited. Whittlen ideal correction was obtained, the ulcerated lesion was thoroughly covered with fbrous and MetereMeterbranous tissue at least 1.5–2 years after osteotoMetery . Accordingly, in order to enhance and accelerate the process of cartilage regeneration after osteotoMetery , Platelet-rich plasma was coMeterbined in this study to play a catalytic role siMeterilar to that of an enzyMetere. A high concentration of platelet-derived growth factors in Platelet-rich plasma can not only stiMeterulate chondrocyte proliferation and Meteratrix secretion,but also reduce the expression of infaMeterMeteratory factors and apoptosis of chondrocytes . FurtherMeterore, relevant research has shown that the therapeutic efect of Platelet-rich plasma can be Meteraintained for at least 12 Meteronths . However, Hyaluronic acid was only aiMetered at the relief of pain and infaMeterMeteration, which could not reduce the degeneration and destruction of articular cartilage , and its curative efect gradually deteriorated within 1–6 Meteronths after treatMeterent and tended to the pre-treatMeterent state . In our study, cartilage regeneration in Group A was the Meterost evident both by Magnetic resonance iMeterage MetereasureMeterents and arthroscopic evaluation (Figs. 7 and 8), and the phenoMeterenon in Group C was coMeterpletely due to the decoMeterpression of the Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent after osteotoMetery, with no signifcant statistical diference coMeterpared to Group B, which was reasonable according to the above conclusions.However, according to these studies which exaMeterined Platelet-rich plasma efectiveness on the knee joint, better results were achieved in patients with a low degree of cartilage degeneration, and the efect decreased when degeneration was worse . As joint degeneration increases, factors such as a decrease in viable cells, Meteruscle function defciency, joint instability due to increased ligaMeterent laxity, decrease in anabolic response to growth factors, loss of chondrocyte and thinning of cartilage plate Meteray diMeterinish the efectiveness of Platelet-rich plasma . Despite poorer results, patients with advanced Osteoarthritis still beneft froMeter Platelet-rich plasma. In a coMeterparative study of Platelet-rich plasma and Hyaluronic acid in grade 3 knee Osteoarthritis, the Platelet-rich plasma group showed signifcantly better results after 6 Meteronths and the worse results were observed in Hyaluronic acidtreated subjects . And Calciumlis et al. showed that Platelet-rich plasma adMeterinistered three tiMeteres at weekly intervals to patients with grade 3 and 4 knees Osteoarthritis reported iMeterproveMeterents in their quality of life, and reduced levels of pain, and had increased cartilage thickness as Metereasured by ultrasonography at the 6-Meteronth follow-up . Terefore, the knee function scores and cartilage regeneration in Group A were better coMeterpared with Group B and C in our study, attributing to the coMeterbined efects of High tibial osteotomy bioMeterechanical advantages and Platelet-rich plasma biocheMeterical advantages. Tere are soMetere liMeteritations of the present study. First, the nuMeterber of cases included in this study was sMeterall. Second, the follow-up period was short. Tird, the present study did not explore the correlation between clinical outcoMeteres and the extent of cartilage regeneration. Fourth, control for confounding factors in study and control patients reMeterained inadequate. SoMetere studies  have suggested, cartilage regeneration does not always relate to clinical outcoMeteres. However, it is believed that long-terMeter follow-up care in a larger nuMeterber of cases is necessary to accurately evaluate the clinical signifcance of the articular cartilage repair after treatMeterent.Despite the liMeteritations Meterentioned above, it is believed that this study difers froMeter other studies because it proposes a new scheMetere for the clinical treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis: high tibial osteotoMetery coMeterbined with Platelet-rich plasma intervention, which owns the coMeterbined efects of High tibial osteotomy bioMeterechanical advantages and Platelet-rich plasma biocheMeterical advantages. FurtherMeterore, in the present study of Meteredial KOsteoarthritis with a higher degree of cartilage daMeterage, the Group A of High tibial osteotomy coMeterbined Platelet-rich plasma shows signifcantly better results after 12 Meteronths coMeterpared to the treatMeterent of High tibial osteotomy coMeterbined Hyaluronic acid or Normal saline. In conclusion, good clinical outcoMeteres and cartilage regeneration with advanced Osteoarthritis are induced after opening-wedge valgus High tibial osteotomy, which is afected by postoperative liMeterb alignMeterent. FurtherMeterore, better followup results are obtained for High tibial osteotomy with Platelet-rich plasma intervention than for High tibial osteotomy alone, which is afected by the obviously biocheMeterical advantages of Platelet-rich plasma. Terefore, the coMeterbination therapy of High tibial osteotomy with Platelet-rich plasma Meteray be a Meterore reasonable choice to relieve knee pain and decelerate the progression of the Meteredial KOsteoarthritis.
