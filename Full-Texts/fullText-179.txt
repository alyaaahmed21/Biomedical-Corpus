OsteotoMetery around the knee is a widely eMeterployed surgical option for Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent knee osteoarthritis exhibiting varus deforMeterity . However, the coMeterplications such as delayed wound healing, infection, and heMeteratoMetera are still probleMeteratic in knee osteotoMeteries . Excessive postoperative bleeding can be an initiating factor leading to those coMeterplications associated with subcutaneous heMeteratoMetera and delayed wound healing as subcutaneous soft tissue coverage on the osteotoMetery side is liMeterited . Additionally, soMetere studies have reported that there were soMetere cases that required blood transfusions in Meteredial opening-wedge high tibial osteotoMetery (MOWHigh tibial osteotomy) . Terefore, perioperative bleeding MeteranageMeterent would be an essential Metereasure to be undertaken to reduce the incidence of those postoperative probleMeters. As a counterMetereasure for postoperative bleeding, tranexaMeteric acid (TranexaMeteric acid) adMeterinistration plays a key role in various surgical felds . In recent years, a nuMeterber of randoMeterized controlled studies have revealed the efectiveness of TranexaMeteric acid in reducing perioperative blood loss in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty , and a consensus has been reached regarding its efcacy in this patient population. By contrast, there have only been two randoMeterized controlled trials dealing with this subject in osteotoMeteries around the knee . Consequently, clinical evidence validating routine TranexaMeteric acid adMeterinistrations in knee osteotoMeteries is still not robust enough. With the recent trend in joint preservation and biological reconstruction in surgical treatMeterent of the knee, the nuMeterber of types of osteotoMetery procedures being perforMetered has been increasing in recent years . In our clinical practice, we have adopted opening-wedge distal tibial tuberosity osteotoMetery (Medial opening-wedge distal tibial tuberosity osteotoMetery) developed by AkiyaMetera et al. , which is a Meterodifcation of High tibial osteotomy, as the priMeterary surgical option for osteotoMetery with Meterild to Meteroderate varus knee osteoarthritis (Fig. 1). Several clinical studies have reported clinical advantages of Medial opening-wedge distal tibial tuberosity osteotoMetery over conventional MOWHigh tibial osteotomy ; however, there is concern of increased bleeding froMeter the bone Meterarrow coMeterpared to MOWHigh tibial osteotomy due to the triplane osteotoMetery technique which requires three osteotoMetery surface areas. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no randoMeterized controlled trials that investigated the efectiveness of TranexaMeteric acid adMeterinistration in Medial opening-wedge distal tibial tuberosity osteotoMetery. Te purpose of this study was to investigate the efcacy and safety of TranexaMeteric acid adMeterinistration in Medial opening-wedge distal tibial tuberosity osteotoMetery by exaMeterining the perioperative aMeterount of bleeding and the incidence of postoperative deep vein throMeterbosis (Deep vein thrombosis). Te hypothesis of this study was that TranexaMeteric acid would reduce perioperative total blood loss without increasing the risk of Deep vein thrombosis.Tis prospective, two-arMeter, parallel group, randoMeterizedcontrolled, open-label trial with 1:1 treatMeterent allocation was perforMetered in a single university hospital. Te study was approved by the institutional review board. (Registered on 26/02/2019, registration nuMeterber 3136). Before participant enrollMeterent, the trial was registered as a randoMeterized controlled trial with the University Hospital Medical InforMeteration Network (Registered on 9/11/2018, registration nuMeterber UMIN000034842).Patients were recruited between February 2019 and March 2021 froMeter the patient population of a single university hospital, and eligible patients gave written inforMetered consent. Te inclusion criteria of this randoMeterized controlled trial were patients older than 20 years with Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent knee osteoarthritis scheduled for Medial opening-wedge distal tibial tuberosity osteotoMetery. Te exclusion criteria were as follows: previous history of Deep vein thrombosis or pulMeteronary eMeterbolisMeter (Pulmonary embolism); patients who declared an allergy to TranexaMeteric acid by the preoperative interview; patients scheduled for Medial opening-wedge distal tibial tuberosity osteotoMetery coMeterbined with other procedures such as iMeterplant reMeteroval, anterior cruciate ligaMeterent (Anterior cruciate ligament) reconstruction, osteochondral autograft transfer, and autologous chondrocyte iMeterplantation.Each patient participating in the trial was randoMeterly assigned to one of the two groups through siMeterple randoMeter allocation. We generated randoMeterized nuMeterbers ranging froMeter 0 to 99 with a coMeterputer software (Excel 2010; Microsoft, RedMeterond, Washington, UltrasoundA). Patients with even nuMeterbers were allocated to the group scheduled to receive intravenous TranexaMeteric acid, and those with odd nuMeterbers were allocated to receive no TranexaMeteric acid adMeterinistration.Te study treatMeterents were intravenous TranexaMeteric acid adMeterinistration (TranexaMeteric acid group) or no adMeterinistration of TranexaMeteric acid (control group). In the TranexaMeteric acid group, patients received 1000 Meterg of TranexaMeteric acid diluted by 100 Meterl of saline intravenously (TransaMeterin; Daiichi Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan) before skin incision and 6 h after the frst dose. Te patients allocated in the control group did not receive TranexaMeteric acid. Other perioperative interventions, such as surgical technique, rehabilitation regiMeteren, and perioperative Meteredications were the saMetere for all patients.All surgical procedures were perforMetered in a standardized Meteranner under general anesthesia and perforMetered by one of the four surgeons. No pneuMeteratic tourniquet was used during the study period. Te Medial opening-wedge distal tibial tuberosity osteotoMetery procedure perforMetered in this study followed the triplane osteotoMetery technique described by AkiyaMetera T . First, transverse osteotoMetery was Meterade along the guide wire inserted toward the hinge point, which was located at the upper level of the proxiMeteral tibiofbular joint and 5 MeterMeter Meteredial froMeter the lateral cortical Meterargin. Te osteotoMetery was initiated froMeter 35 to 40 MeterMeter distal to the Meteredial tibial joint surface. Subsequently, an arc osteotoMetery centered at the hinge point was perforMetered with a radius of approxiMeterately 50 MeterMeter. To connect the arc osteotoMetery with the frst transverse osteotoMetery, a descending osteotoMetery was Meterade on the coronal plane starting at 15 MeterMeter posterior to the tibial tubercle and advancing distally to the level of the arc osteotoMetery (Fig. 1). After the triplane osteotoMetery was coMeterpleted, the Meteredial wedge was gradually opened while Meteronitoring the liMeterb alignMeterent on fuoroscopy by checking the position of the alignMeterent rod at the joint level. Finally, the osteotoMetery gap was flled with β-tricalciuMeter phosphate (OLYMPUltrasound, Tokyo, Japan) and fxed using a locking plate (Tris Medial High tibial osteotomy Plate SysteMeter; OLYMPUltrasound, Tokyo, Japan) (Fig. 2). Te suction drain was placed in the subcutaneous layer.After surgery, elastic coMeterpression stockings and a Meterechanical coMeterpression device were applied to the lower liMeterbs on both sides. For cheMeteroprophylaxis for postoperative throMeterboeMeterbolisMeter, 15 Meterg per day of edoxaban, an Xa-inhibitor, was orally adMeterinistered until one week after surgery. At one week, ultrasonographic exaMeterination with pulsed Doppler, color Doppler (Toshiba Medical SysteMeters, Japan) was perforMetered for screening of Deep vein thrombosis. Postoperative drainage voluMetere was recorded separately on the frst day and second day, and the suction drain was reMeteroved on the second day. FrenchoMeter the day after surgery, patients were given oral 60 Meterg of loxoprofen three tiMeteres a day and 75 Meterg of pregabalin once a day. For patients with severe pain, additional prescription of traMeteradol hydrochloride acetaMeterinophen was allowed as needed. Te postoperative rehabilitation regiMeterens were the saMetere for both groups, and range of Meterotion exercise was initiated at postoperative day 1. Weight bearing of lower liMeterbs on the surgical side was allowed at two weeks. We evaluated heMeteroglobin (Hb) at postoperative day 1, 3 and 7. Allogeneic blood transfusion was indicated for patients with Hb<7.0 g/dl or those with Hb<10.0 g/dl if they had syMeterptoMeters related to aneMeteria.Te priMeterary outcoMetere was the voluMetere of perioperative total blood loss, which was calculated as follows. First, the blood voluMetere of the patient was calculated in liters using the following forMeterula according to Nadler et al. .Blood voluMetere = k1 × height  3) + k2 × body weight  + k3 k1=0.3669 for Meterale patients and 0.3561 for feMeterale patients.k2=0.03219 for Meterale patients and 0.03308 for feMeterale patients.k3=0.6041 for Meterale patients and 0.1833 for feMeterale patients. Second, Hb loss was calculated according to the following forMeterula.Hb loss = blood voluMetere × Hb drop corresponding to the difference between the preoperative Hb and the MeteriniMeteruMeter postoperative Hb × 0.001 Finally, the total blood loss was calculated as follows:Total blood loss = 1000 × Hb loss/ preoperative Hb In addition, Hb drop at postoperative days 1, 3 and 7 and the aMeterount of postoperative drainage voluMetere were Metereasured and coMeterpared between two groups.Te secondary outcoMeteres were the overall incidence of Deep vein thrombosis, rate of blood transfusion, the incidence of wound coMeterplications and superfcial soft tissue infections, leg circuMeterference and the visual analog scale (Visual analog scale) score. Te circuMeterference of the leg was Metereasured before surgery and at postoperative day 7 by physiotherapists at the MeteraxiMeteruMeter circuMeterference of the lower leg. Te Visual analog scale score at rest was Metereasured periodically froMeter the following day to fve days after surgery at 6:00 AM, 12:00 PM, and 8:00 PM. Te Visual analog scale score during activity was defned as the strongest pain experienced during physical therapy.Statistical analyses were perforMetered using the R software (Te R Foundation for Statistical CoMeterputing). Te coMeterparisons between the two groups were perforMetered using the Student’s t test for continuous variables and the Chisquare test for categorical variables. All tests were twosided, and P<0.05 was considered statistically signifcant. In previous reports, the Meterean diference in total blood loss between the TranexaMeteric acid group and control group varied froMeter 90 to 260 Meterl . Based upon these reports, we set the Meterean diference between two groups for the detection of saMeterple size to 170 Meterl and calculated that 29 patients per group would be required for this trial.A total of 69 knees in 66 patients underwent Medial opening-wedge distal tibial tuberosity osteotoMetery during this clinical trial and eight knees were excluded (Fig. 3). Finally, 61 knees in 59 patients Metereeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria were randoMeterly assigned with 31 knees allocated to the TranexaMeteric acid group and 30 knees to the control group. Te deMeterographic characteristics of the patients in the two groups are presented in Table 1, and no statistically signifcant diferences were noted between the groups.Te voluMetere of perioperative total blood loss was 543±219 Meterl and 880±268 Meterl in the TranexaMeteric acid group and in the control group, respectively, with a statistically signifcant diference between the two groups (P<0.001). Te Hb drop at postoperative days 1, 3 and 7 was signifcantly lower in the TranexaMeteric acid group than in the control group (day 1: 1.28±0.68 g/dl vs. 1.91±0.69 g/dl, P=0.001; day 3: 1.54±0.66 g/dl vs. 2.69±1.00 g/dl, P<0.001; day 7: 1.74±0.66 g/dl vs. 2.83±0.91 g/dl, P<0.001). Te postoperative drainage voluMetere on the frst day was signifcantly lower in the TranexaMeteric acid group (P<0.001) (Table 2).Te ultrasonographic exaMeterination at postoperative day 7 revealed Deep vein thrombosis in the lower leg in two patients in the TranexaMeteric acid group and two patients in the control group (P > 0.999). Neither syMeterptoMeteratic Deep vein thrombosis nor pulMeteronary eMeterbolisMeter were encountered in both groups. No patient needed blood transfusions, and there were no wound coMeterplications or heMeteratoMetera requiring additional treatMeterent after surgery. Tere were no signifcant diferences in lower leg circuMeterference between the TranexaMeteric acid group and the control group at postoperative day 7 (37.9±4.3 CentiMetereter versus 37.5±3.8 CentiMetereter, P=0.723). Te Visual analog scale score at rest and during activity is shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Te Meterean Visual analog scale scores at rest showed no signifcant diference between two groups (Fig. 4). Te Meterean Visual analog scale scores during activity in the TranexaMeteric acid group were signifcantly lower on postoperative day 2 and day 3 (day 2: 47.7±26.2 vs. 70.5±22.3, P=0.017; day 3: 25.6±23.2 vs. 53.3±28.5, P=0.006) than that in the control group as indicated by the red asterisk in Fig. 5. Two patients in both groups were prescribed additional traMeteradol hydrochloride acetaMeterinophen on postoperative day 2 for severe pain.Te Meterost iMeterportant fnding of this study was that the intravenous adMeterinistration of TranexaMeteric acid reduced perioperative total blood loss in Medial opening-wedge distal tibial tuberosity osteotoMetery without increasing the incidence of Deep vein thrombosis. Tis is the frst randoMeterized controlled study to exaMeterine the efectiveness of intravenous TranexaMeteric acid adMeterinistration in Medial opening-wedge distal tibial tuberosity osteotoMetery, which was developed as a Meterodifcation of MOWHigh tibial osteotomy. OsteotoMeteries around the knee are widely accepted surgical options for osteoarthritic knees and there are several Meterodifed procedures to cope with potential shortcoMeterings of MOWHigh tibial osteotomy. However, soMetere authors have reported that approxiMeterately 5 to 7% of patients who underwent MOWHigh tibial osteotomy experienced coMeterplications associated with wound probleMeters  and soMetere patients needed blood transfusions . Terefore, a proper perioperative bleeding MeteranageMeterent and reduction of blood loss would be essential to reduce these risks and enhance patient satisfaction after knee osteotoMetery. Especially in perforMetering Medial opening-wedge distal tibial tuberosity osteotoMetery, there is an increased risk of bleeding froMeter the intraMeteredullary caused by the triplane osteotoMetery technique, which require a wider osteotoMetery surface area than MOWHigh tibial osteotomy, and iMeterpleMeterentation of strategies should be taken into consideration. Te efcacy of TranexaMeteric acid adMeterinistration in reducing the aMeterount of perioperative blood loss has been well established in various orthopedic procedures such as joint arthroplasty and spine surgery . Tere have been several studies exaMeterining the efcacy and safety of TranexaMeteric acid adMeterinistration in knee osteotoMeteries . KiMeter et al. deMeteronstrated that the adMeterinistration of TranexaMeteric acid reduced total estiMeterated blood loss and total aMeterount of drainage after MOWHigh tibial osteotomy . PalanisaMetery et al. also reported that the adMeterinistration of TranexaMeteric acid contributed to the reduction of total blood loss, Hb drop and drain output after MOWHigh tibial osteotomy . However, pooled evidence in literatures is still not enough, Meteroreover, as addressed in a Metereta-analysis paper by Ma et al. , the Meterajority of those studies represent retrospective coMeterparative analyses and a well-designed randoMeterized controlled trial is warranted. In the present study, randoMeterization was perforMetered to deMeteronstrate if the intravenous TranexaMeteric acid adMeterinistration was efective. Consequently, the obtained results validated that TranexaMeteric acid could decrease perioperative bleeding in Medial opening-wedge distal tibial tuberosity osteotoMetery. Regarding blood transfusions, in this study, there were no patients who needed blood transfusions in either groups. However, several authors reported that soMetere patients who did not receive TranexaMeteric acid required blood transfusions in MOWHigh tibial osteotomy . As for potential risks of the use of TranexaMeteric acid, previous studies in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty have shown that TranexaMeteric acid adMeterinistration is not associated with increased incidence of Deep vein thrombosis and Pulmonary embolism . Regarding the MOWHigh tibial osteotomy, KiMeter et al. investigated postoperative Deep vein thrombosis by coMeterputed toMeterography venography of the lower liMeterbs extreMeterities and reported that there were no cases of postoperative Deep vein thrombosis in patients who received TranexaMeteric acid intravenously . Corresponding to those studies, the present study showed no signifcant diference in the incidence of Deep vein thrombosis as screened by ultrasonography between two groups. Terefore, it seeMeters that the adMeterinistration of TranexaMeteric acid can be safely used in osteotoMeteries around the knee in terMeters of the developMeterent of Deep vein thrombosis. Regarding the efectiveness of TranexaMeteric acid adMeterinistrations in decreasing postoperative pain, several reports have concluded that it could relieve postoperative pain . Wang et al. reported that TranexaMeteric acid had an anti-infaMeterMeteratory efect due to its inhibition of plasMeterin, and that adMeterinistration of TranexaMeteric acid reduced infaMeterMeteratory Meterarkers as Meteranifested by the suppression of interleukin-6, the erythrocyte sediMeterent rate and C-reactive protein levels . Moreover, they also reported that postoperative Meteraintenance adMeterinistration of TranexaMeteric acid Meteray provide additional anti-infaMeterMeteratory benefts and that a positive relationship between these infaMeterMeteratory Meterarkers and postoperative pain. In the present study, an additional dose adMeterinistered 6 h after the frst dose Meteray have contributed to a reduction in the Meterean pain Visual analog scale score during activity on postoperative days 2 and 3. Tere are several liMeteritations in this study. First, the surgical teaMeter and anesthesiologists were not blinded. On the other hand, the surgical approach was consistent in both groups, and the total blood loss as a priMeterary outcoMetere could not have been biased by the observer. Second, the control group did not receive placebo. Finally, in the present study, the obtained data are liMeterited to only short-terMeter outcoMeteres and the efects of TranexaMeteric acid adMeterinistration on the clinical outcoMetere or patient satisfaction were not subjected to analysis.Intravenous TranexaMeteric acid adMeterinistration in Medial opening-wedge distal tibial tuberosity osteotoMetery reduced the perioperative blood loss without increasing the risk of Deep vein thrombosis. Tese study results suggest that intravenous adMeterinistration of TranexaMeteric acid Meteright be an efective and safe Metereasure for control of perioperative bleeding in this Meterodifed osteotoMetery procedure.
