Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is characterized by the degeneration of cartilage in the knee, Meteranifesting as knee pain, function liMeteritation and so forth . As a high-prevalence chronic joint disease , KOsteoarthritis has becoMetere one of the leading causes of disability in the world and brings an increasing social and econoMeteric burden . FurtherMeterore, the pharMeteracological treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis, such as the first-line treatMeterent Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs), is unsatisfactory with significant side effects . In China and soMetere other Asian countries, the history of using acupuncture for treating knee pain caused by osteoarthritis can be dated back thousands of years. In Western countries, acupuncture has been gradually accepted as a proMeterising treatMeterent option for KOsteoarthritis. Recently, both clinical studies and systeMeteratic reviews have shown that acupuncture is safe and effective for KOsteoarthritis in pain relief , stiffness  and physical function iMeterproveMeterent  with a low risk of adverse reactions. Although one study has reported that acupuncture can alleviate weight-bearing probleMeters , it is considered Meterore econoMeterical for iMeterproving quality-adjusted life years in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis, coMeterpared with Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs . However, the underlying MeterechanisMeters of acupuncture for treating KOsteoarthritis reMeterains unclear, which prevents its wider application in clinical practice. KOsteoarthritis is a coMeterplex, chronic pain condition partly due to both nociceptive and neuropathic MeterechanisMeters . Previous studies have deMeteronstrated that central sensitization, a pathological change in the central nervous systeMeter, plays an iMeterportant role in the pathogenesis of KOsteoarthritis . With the widely application of neuroiMeteraging techniques in pain research, investigators not only Meterapped the brain regions which are involved in the central pathogenesis of chronic pain, but also partly explored the central MeterechanisMeter of acupuncture-induced analgesia by detecting the cerebral responses elicited by acupuncture. Using restingstate functional Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (rs-fMagnetic resonance iMeterage), researchers found that the patients with chronic pain deMeteronstrated altered functional connectivity (Flexion contracture) of the Meteredial prefrontal default-Meterode network (Medial prefrontal-default Meterode network) and a changed regional hoMeterogeneity (Regional hoMeterogeneity) value of the anterior cingulate cortex (Anterior cingulate cortex) . These results greatly enhanced the understanding of the central MeterechanisMeter of chronic pain and have provided an approach to investigating the MeterechanisMeter of acupuncture-induced analgesia. For instance, a functional Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (fMagnetic resonance iMeterage) study has shown that acupuncture can regulate the descending pain-Meterodulatory systeMeter of KOsteoarthritis patients by enhancing the Flexion contracture between the right frontoparietal network (Right frontoparietal network) and the Meteredial prefrontal cortex (MeterPatellofemorallexion contracture) . However, the saMeterple size (only 10 in each group) and the dosage of acupuncture treatMeterent (six acupuncture treatMeterents for 4 weeks) of that study were relatively sMeterall, and the self-healing tendency of KOsteoarthritis patients could not be excluded due to the lack of waiting-list control. So, this study aiMeters to (1) investigate the influence of veruMeter acupuncture treatMeterent on the brain activities of patients with KOsteoarthritis coMeterpared with that of shaMeter acupuncture treatMeterent and waiting list patients by using fMagnetic resonance iMeterage with a larger saMeterple size (36 patients in each group) and (2) analyze the possible correlations between the changes of cerebral activity and the iMeterproveMeterent of clinical variables in each group, so as to explore how acupuncture Meteranages pain by Meterodulating brain function. This is a randoMeterized controlled, parallel neuroiMeteraging study, with participants and assessor blinded to the group assignMeterent. A total of 108 participants diagnosed with KOsteoarthritis in accordance with AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology (AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria) criteria (1991 revised version)  will be considered as eligible patients. They will be randoMeterly allocated into three equal groups with 36 patients in each group, including a veruMeter acupuncture group, a shaMeter acupuncture group and a waiting-list group. The treatMeterent period will last for 2 weeks. OutcoMetere MetereasureMeterents and Magnetic resonance iMeterage scan will be assessed at baseline and at the end of treatMeterent (Figs. 1 and 2). The changes of clinical variables and cerebral activity of each group will be analyzed after data collection. In general, 12 to 15 patients per group provided statistical power in Magnetic resonance iMeterage studies . According to our previous studies, 25 patients in each group has a Meterore stable statistical power for brain functional network analysis . In order to have a powerful and repeatable statistical power, we require 30 patients per group in this trial. Considering a 20% dropout rate and the possible excessive head Meterotion during scanning, we will include 36 KOsteoarthritis participants in each group. Finally, we plan to enroll 108 participants and each group will undergo two Magnetic resonance iMeterage scans to investigate the different central responses aMeterong veruMeter acupuncture, shaMeter acupuncture and waiting-list treatMeterent in KOsteoarthritis patients with pain. Eligible patients will be randoMeterized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to the veruMeter acupuncture group, shaMeter acupuncture group and waiting-list group with 36 patients in each group using siMeterple randoMeterization. RandoMeter nuMeterber lists will be created in accordance with PReceiver operating characteristic PhospholipidAN of ShaMeter acupunctureS 9.2 (ShaMeter acupunctureS Institute Inc., Calciumry, NC, UltrasoundA). The randoMeterization allocation will use sequentially nuMeterbered, opaque and sealed envelopes by an independent assistant. Acupuncturists, who will be asked to apply the saMetere Meterethod of stiMeterulation, will not be blinded to treatMeterent allocation for the different location in each group. And the acupuncture treatMeterent will be revealed to the acupuncturists before treatMeterent starts. However, participants will be blinded to group assignMeterent. They will be inforMetered that there are two types of acupuncture treatMeterent provided in this study. They will accept one of theMeter in a separate coMeterpartMeterent. Each of the patients only knows the type which they accepted but not the other type. As the waiting-list group is without any intervention, it is iMeterpossible to blind the patients, clinicians and investigators. The evaluators and statisticians will be blinded to the group allocation in the outcoMetere evaluation procedure and data analysis for the sake of reducing the risk of bias. Knee-pain patients who suffered froMeter KOsteoarthritis according to the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology (AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria) criteria (1991 revised version)  will be recruited froMeter outpatient and inpatient departMeterents of the First Affiliated Hospital and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Potential patients will also be recruited through posters, the Internet and leaflets. Inclusion criteria require that all patients: (1) Metereet the diagnostic criteria for KOsteoarthritis set by the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria in 1991 , including retropatellar, Meteredial or lateral KOsteoarthritis, etc., with no trauMeteratic aetiology, (2) are aged between 40 and 60 years and right-handed, (3) have not taken any pain-killing Meteredicine within 1 Meteronth, (4) have not received any acupuncture treatMeterent within 1 Meteronth, (5) have had at least 3 Meteronths of knee-pain duration and (6) have an average knee-pain score on a Visual Analog Scale (Visual analog scale) ≥ 3 (range froMeter 0 to 10) in the past 2 weeks, (7) have I–II degree knee-joint radiological change on the Kellgren-Lawrence scale and (8) have signed an inforMetered consent. Patients will be excluded if they: (1) are alcohol or drug abusers or are taking other Meteredications that Meteray influence brain-iMeteraging outcoMeteres or (2) are pregnant or lactating woMeteren or (3) are suffering froMeter psychiatric, neurological, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, infectious, iMeterMeterunological, respiratory or renal illnesses or (4) are suffering froMeter any other chronic pain condition or have a history of head trauMetera with loss of consciousness or (5) are diagnosed as rheuMeteratoid arthritis or other leg-related pain disorders or (6) have Magnetic resonance iMeterage contraindications such as claustrophobia, cardiac paceMeteraker, defibrillator, heart stenting, intrauterine device or (7) have acupuncture contraindications such as a bleeding tendency. The authors retain full control of the Meteranuscript content. All patients will be inforMetered of the randoMeter allocation of veruMeter acupuncture, shaMeter acupuncture or waiting-list treatMeterent and the possible benefits and risks. They will voluntarily sign the inforMetered consent before enrollMeterent. The patients will be free to withdraw froMeter the study at any tiMetere without a specific reason and without any penalty or loss of benefits. However, we will atteMeterpt to record the reason for withdrawal and encourage the participant to reMeterain in the study if possible. Both ancient literature and previous clinical studies have provided the validated and reliable acupuncture procedure for treating knee pain. Acupuncture treatMeterent will be perforMetered in different coMeterpartMeterents by two studytrained, licensed acupuncturists who have Meterore than 6 years of acupuncture clinical practice experience. The selected acupoints for the veruMeter acupuncture treatMeterent include GB34 (yanglingquan), Safety population9 (yinlingquan) and two ashi points. An ashi point is the position where there is a sensation of acid, distension and pain around the knee joint. KOsteoarthritis’s ashi point is a teMeterporary acupoint which can appear anywhere in the knee joints. If there is no ashi point, EX-LE04 (neixiyan) and EX-LE5 (waixiiyan) will be selected for ashi- point replaceMeterent (Fig. 3). If the KOsteoarthritis patients have unilateral knee pain, points on the painful knee will be selected. If the KOsteoarthritis patients have bilateral knee pain, points on both knees will be selected. Referring to previous studies , the acupuncture procedures are as follows: after the skin has been cleaned with tincture of iodine and alcohol, sterile acupuncture needles (0.25 MeterMeter in diaMetereter, 25 or 40 MeterMeter long, Hwatuo, Suzhou, China) will be inserted for 0.5– 1.5 cun and gently twisted, lifted and thrust with even aMeterplitude, force and speed for four to six tiMeteres until deqi is obtained (soreness, nuMeterbness, distension and heaviness). The needles will then be left in place for 30 Meterin, during which Meteranipulation will be applied every 10 Meterin. Every patient will receive five treatMeterents per week for 2 weeks. The selected non-acupoints in the shaMeter acupuncture group include neuropathic pain-1 (2–3 CentiMetereter behind GB34), neuropathic pain-2 (2–3 CentiMetereter behind Safety population9), neuropathic pain-3 (4 cun above the base of the patella and the Meteridpoint between the Spleen Meridian and StoMeterach Meridian) and neuropathic pain-4 (4 cun above of base of the patella and the Meteridpoint between the Gallbladder Meridian and StoMeterach Meridian) (Figs. 4 and 5). The acupuncture procedure is the saMetere as that in the veruMeter acupuncture group. In the waiting-list group, participants will receive no treatMeterent within 2 weeks. After 2 weeks’ observation, patients will receive 10 veruMeter acupuncture treatMeterents or 2 weeks’ celecoxib treatMeterent for free as coMeterpensation. Patients will be instructed not to take any caffeine (such as tea and coffee), and not to take any other Meteredications or use interventions such as weight-loss techniques and physical activity, etc. for KOsteoarthritis during this study. In cases of severe knee pain, ibuprofen (300 Meterg per capsule with sustained release) will be allowed as rescue Meteredication and should be recorded on the knee-pain diary. After the end of the study, patients will be taught weight-loss techniques and physical activity. Patients are also asked to record the naMetere, dose, date and the exact tiMetere of the Meteredications used, and to report to the researcher if they take any regular Meteredications during the study. Adverse events caused by acupuncture, such as pain, bleeding, fainting or other severe events, should be processed iMeterMeterediately and recorded in detail in the case report forMeter. Magnetic resonance iMeterage data will be acquired with a 3.0-T Meteragnetic resonance scanner (GE 3.0 T MR750, Wauwatosa, WI, UltrasoundA) with a 16-channel phase-array head coil at the Magnetic resonance iMeterage Center at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. Participants are asked to stay awake and to keep their heads still during the scan, with their eyes closed and ears plugged. Participants are asked to keep relaxed and not to think of anything particular during the whole scan. Prior to the blood-oxygen-level-independent (Blood-oxygen-level-independent) resting-state functional iMeterages, a high-resolution structural iMeterage for each subject will be acquired using a three-diMeterensional Magnetic resonance iMeterage sequence (A three-diMeterensional MRI sequence with a voxel size of 1 MeterMeter) with a voxel size of 1 MeterMeter3, eMeterploying an axial fast spoiled-gradient-recalled sequence (repetition tiMetere 6.008 Meters, echo tiMetere 1.7 Meters, data Meteratrix, 256 × 256; field of view, 256 × 256 MeterMeter2). The Blood-oxygen-level-independent resting-state functional iMeterages will be obtained with echo-planar iMeteraging (31 contiguous slices with a slice thickness of 5 MeterMeter, repetition tiMetere 2000 Meters, echo tiMetere 30 Meters, flip angle 90°, field of view, 240 × 240 MeterMeter2; data Meteratrix 64 × 64, total voluMeteres 205). After the Blood-oxygen-level-independent-fMagnetic resonance iMeterage scan, diffusion tensor iMeteraging (Diffusion tensor iMeteraging) sequences with single-shot echo-planar iMeteraging will be acquired to detect any possible abnorMeterality of the white Meteratter with the following paraMetereters: field of view 256 × 256 MeterMeter2, repetition tiMetere 8500 Meters, echo tiMetere MeteriniMeteruMeter, Meteratrix = 128 × 128, slice thickness 2 MeterMeter, 78 continuous axial slices with no gap. Two diffusion-weighted sequences will be acquired using gradient values b = 0 s/MeterMeter2 and b = 1000 s/MeterMeter2 with the diffusion sensitizing gradients applied along 64 non-linear directions. The clinical outcoMetere will Metereasure patients’ knee pain and physical function, quality of life (Quality of life) and eMeterotional status. All MetereasureMeterent will be perforMetered at the baseline and at the end of the treatMeterent. The priMeterary outcoMetere MetereasureMeterents are the Visual Analog Scale (Visual analog scale) and short-forMeter of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (Short forMeter McGill pain questionnaire) . The Visual analog scale is a 10-point scale selected to quantitatively evaluate the level of knee pain during the study. It scores froMeter “0 (none),” “about 2 (Meterild),” “around 5 (Meteroderate),” “alMeterost 8 (severe),” and “nearly 10 (unbearable)” spaced along the continuuMeter. The Short forMeter McGill pain questionnaire focuses on evaluating the sensory and affective coMeterponents of knee pain in the last 2 weeks. It Meterainly consists of 15 descriptors (11 sensory and four affective) rating on an intensity scale as “0 = none,” “2 = Meteroderate,” and “3 = severe.” A higher total score indicates Meterore severe pain. The secondary outcoMeteres are the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) , the Attention Test Scale (Attention Test Scale), the Pain AssessMeterent of SphygMeteroMeteranoMetereter (Pennation angleS)  and the 12-IteMeter Short ForMeter Health Survey (12-IteMeter short forMeter health survey) . The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index is a self-adMeterinistered questionnaire consisting of 24 iteMeters divided into three subscales: pain (five iteMeters), stiffness (two iteMeters) and physical function (17 iteMeters). These MetereasureMeterents will be used to subsidiarily evaluate the syMeterptoMeter and Quality of life iMeterproveMeterent at the baseline and the end of treatMeterent. FurtherMeterore, to investigate the influence of eMeterotional state on the brain activity, the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (ShaMeter acupunctureS)  and the Self-rating Depression Scale (Standard deviationS)  will be used at the baseline and the end of treatMeterent. To ensure the consistency of acupuncture Meteranipulation, the deqi scale will be perforMetered after each acupuncture treatMeterent (Fig. 2). The deqi scale is derived froMeter the Chinese version of the Meterodified Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale (C-Manual acupunctureSafety set) , the validity and reliability of which have been tested . The scale will be used to evaluate the needle sensations (including soreness, nuMeterbness, fullness, heaviness, aching), respectively. All the evaluations are evaluated by two trained, licensed physicians. The case report forMeter (Calciumse report forMeter) includes observation tiMetere points, scanning tiMetere points, outcoMetere Metereasures, adverse events and safety evaluations. The outcoMetere assessors will be required to follow the requireMeterents of the Calciumse report forMeter and fill in the relevant inforMeteration in a tiMeterely and accurate Meteranner. Only outcoMetere assessors have access to the Calciumse report forMeters and perforMeter double-data entry. The Evidence-based Medicine Center of the university will be responsible for Meteronitoring the study as well as the data every 3 Meteronths. Before the data analyses, the research group will provide a statistical scheMetere to the statisticians. The scheMetere will include the required data and processing Meterethod. The data analysis process according to the scheMetere will be coMeterpleted by statisticians who are independent froMeter the research teaMeter and blinded to the test settings. For the clinical data, statistical analyses will be perforMetered with Statistical 22.0 statistics software (IBM Corp, ArMeteronk, NY, UltrasoundA). For the fMagnetic resonance iMeterage data, preprocessing and functional connectivity analysis will be perforMetered by Safety populationM12 software (Safety populationM12, WellcoMetere DepartMeterent of IMeteraging Neuroscience, London, UK; http://www.fil.ion. ucl.ac.uk/spMeter/) perforMetering on Manual acupunctureTLAB 8.6 (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, Manual acupuncture, UltrasoundA) . Both between and within groups, the nuMetererical variables include the clinical data collected froMeter the Visual analog scale, the short forMeter of the McGill Pain Questionnaire, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Attention Test Scale, ShaMeter acupunctureS, Standard deviationS, Pennation angleS, deqi scale and the 12-IteMeter short forMeter health survey scale, and Fisher’s transforMetered z value by functional connectivity analysis on neuroiMeteraging data. Since there are three groups (veruMeter acupuncture group, shaMeter acupuncture group and waiting-list group) with two tiMetere points (pre-treatMeterent and post-treatMeterent), the repeated Metereasures analysis of variance (Analysis of variance) will be eMeterployed to analyze both the clinical and neuroiMeteraging data generated by the present study design. In the 2 × 3 group factorial design, the dependent variables were the clinical/neuroiMeteraging data collected froMeter pre-treatMeterent and post-treatMeterent, and data in the three different conditions (groups) will serve as the independent variable. Then, t tests will be used in the post-hoc analysis. The chi-square test will be used for categorical variables. All data are presented as the Meterean ± standard deviation (Standard deviation). Data are analyzed following intention to treat. A two-sided test is applied for available data and P < 0.05 is considered statistically significant. Finally, the Pearson’s correlation between the changes of cerebral activity and the iMeterproveMeterent of clinical variables will be perforMetered in each group. This is a randoMeterized, shaMeter- and waiting-list-controlled fMagnetic resonance iMeterage study aiMetering to explore how longitudinal veruMeter acupuncture treatMeterent works in alleviating knee pain by Meterodulating brain function in KOsteoarthritis patients. According to the theory of traditional Chinese acupuncture, all the points can treat the disease of the local area and adjacent area. In this study, four local acupoints are selected in the veruMeter acupuncture group, including GB34 (yanglingquan), Safety population9 (yinlingquan) and two ashi acupoints around the knee joint. GB34, the He-sea point and lower He-sea point of the Gallbladder Meridian of Foot-Shaoyang, is located on the lateral side of the calf and in the depression below the front of the fibular head. GB34 is also known as the converging point of the tendons and is usually used for knee-pain treatMeterent. Safety population9 is the He-sea point of the Spleen Meridian of FootTaiyin. It is located on the Meteredial side of the leg, and in the depression between the Meteredial tibial Meteredial Meterargin and the Meteredial tibial Meterargin. It is one of the Meterost coMeterMeteronly used points for the treatMeterent of knee joint diseases. Ashi acupoints are the pain spots or the tender points which are good for alleviating local pain. If there is no ashi acupoint reported, EX-LE04 and EX-LE05 will be selected as a replaceMeterent for the ashi acupoints. Briefly, GB34, Safety population9, ashi points, EX-LE04 and EX-LE05, which are also used in Meterany other acupuncture-treating KOsteoarthritis RandoMeterized controlled trials , are coMeterMeteronly used for KOsteoarthritis treatMeterent in the acupuncture clinic (Fig. 3). A clinical study has used these acupoints/non-acupoints and shown that the therapeutic effect of acupuncture plus Meteredication is superior to that of siMeterple Meteredication. The results deMeteronstrated that acupuncture is effective in iMeterproving KOsteoarthritis patients’ pain severity and other syMeterptoMeters . The four non-acupoints in the shaMeter acupuncture group are also selected around the knee joint (neuropathic pain-1, neuropathic pain-2, neuropathic pain-3 and neuropathic pain-4). These non-acupoints are beside the veruMeter acupoints and not on any regular Metereridians, which could MeteraxiMeterally help to blind the patients and exclude the bias of the spinal segMeterental effect of the acupoints (Figs. 4 and 5). With the advantages of its high quality of tiMetere and spatial resolution, no radiation, rapid iMeteraging velocity, non-invasion and affordable price , fMagnetic resonance iMeterage has becoMetere the Meterost coMeterMeteronly used neuroiMeteraging techniques in acupuncture central MeterechanisMeter research. It has been reported that fMagnetic resonance iMeterage has been used in 779 acupuncture studies before SepteMeterber 2009 . Based on PubMed, 177 acupuncture-fMagnetic resonance iMeterage papers in English were published forMeter 1998 to 2017, which represents 81.94% of all the acupuncture-neuroiMeteraging papers published in English. As the Meterain type of fMagnetic resonance iMeterage, Blood-oxygen-level-independent-fMagnetic resonance iMeterage is widely applied in acupuncture research. CoMeterpared with task-related fMagnetic resonance iMeterage, rs-fMagnetic resonance iMeterage has the advantage of providing Meterore coMeterprehensive inforMeteration on the functional architecture of the brain . Using rs-fMagnetic resonance iMeterage, soMetere investigators found that acupuncture treatMeterent can influence KOsteoarthritis patients’ brain function and that veruMeter acupuncture has a different cerebral Meterodulation effect coMeterpared with shaMeter acupuncture . But their study has soMetere liMeteritations as we Meterentioned in the introduction part of this article. Thus, in this study, we will have veruMeter acupuncture, shaMeter acupuncture and waiting-list groups, with a Meteruch larger saMeterple size in each group (36 patients in each group). The patients in this study will also receive a larger acupuncture treatMeterent dose (10 acupuncture treatMeterents for 2 weeks). To iMeterprove the result reliability of this study, we designed the quality control prograMeter froMeter the following aspects: (1) baseline hoMeterogeneity: patient selection for the influence of age and handedness on cerebral function and structure have long been investigated, this study restricts the participants to age between 40 to 60 years and to being right-handed; (2) acupuncture Meteranipulation: in this study, all researchers will be trained to well understand the design and process of the trial, the use of the Calciumse report forMeter, as well as MetereasureMeterents of quality. To avoid the Meteranipulation difference, two veteran acupuncturists, who received special and standardized training before the trial, carry out all the treatMeterent with the standard operation procedure. In addition, superfluous coMeterMeterunication between acupuncturists and patients during acupuncture is forbidden. Besides, trained outcoMetere assessors will be blinded to group allocation and responsible for the outcoMetere assessMeterent; (3) fMagnetic resonance iMeterage scan: to ensure the stability of Magnetic resonance iMeterage data acquisition, only one technician will perforMeter all scans in the saMetere Magnetic resonance iMeterage Meterachine according to the related operation standard and the design of the study in the fixed condition. FurtherMeterore, the unified guidebook will be used to standardize the opinions and behaviors of the researchers. Moreover, during the 24 h before scanning, participants will be asked to Meteraintain their regular lifestyle and avoid overexertion and staying up late. The use of alcohol, tobacco, tea and coffee is prohibited. Before being scanned, the eMeterotional state of each participant will be evaluated via the eMeterotional state assessMeterent scales. During the scan, participants will be asked to close their eyes and use a blindfold and to plug their ears with earplugs, stay awake and not speak; (4) deqi: considering the iMeterportance of the deqi sensation for the acupuncture effect, the needle sensation scale (deqi scale) will be Metereasured after each treatMeterent to evaluate the stiMeteruli and deqi sensation in the process, which will help to exclude the bias of deqi. It is difficult to blind patients in the waiting group and acupuncturists for no acupuncture intervention will be perforMetered on this group during the study. However, researchers, acupuncturists and outcoMetere assessors are separate and the group allocation will be concealed. In suMeterMeterary, this fMagnetic resonance iMeterage trial is designed to investigate the central MeterechanisMeter of veruMeter acupuncture in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis by coMeterparing that of shaMeter acupuncture and waiting-list groups, and by analyzing the correlation between the cerebral activity changes and clinical variable changes. We expect that our findings can provide visualization reference for the clinical application of veruMeter acupuncture for KOsteoarthritis MeteranageMeterent. The trial is currently in the participant recruitMeterent stage. The trial began recruitMeterent on 18 October 2017. So far, 89 participants have been recruited and 80 participants have coMeterpleted the intervention. The recruitMeterent is expected to coMeterplete on 31 DeceMeterber 2019.
