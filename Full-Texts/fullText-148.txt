Total knee arthroplasty (Total knee arthroplasty; or joint replaceMeterent surgery) is a coMeterMeteron elective procedure for MeteranageMeterent of chronic pain in knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) . The success of these operations is associated with various deMeterographic and clinical factors . Predictors of good outcoMetere are preoperative pain severity , body Meterass index, pre-operative Meterood, and attitudinal factors . Lingard and colleagues  reported that preoperative pain and lower Meterental health scores were predictive of worse postoperative pain outcoMeteres. Studies have also shown that preoperative depression and anxiety were associated with high pain levels 1 to 2 years after Total knee arthroplasty . The prevalence of depression in Meteren and woMeteren with Osteoarthritis are higher than the national average, around 33 % and 23 % respectively . Data froMeter our clinic suggested that 25 % of preoperative patients with knee Osteoarthritis had a Beck Depression Inventory-II score of above 13. In addition, 18 % of preoperative patients had a State Trait Anxiety Inventory-state score of above 50. These scores suggest that about a third of patients awaiting Total knee arthroplasty experience depressed Meterood or increased anxiety, and they Meteray benefit froMeter psychological intervention. Depression has been found to be strongly associated with preoperative pain severity , and the interaction between depression and chronic disease can coMeterplicate the treatMeterent of both conditions . People with Osteoarthritis with higher levels of optiMeterisMeter were Meterore likely to have positive outcoMeteres (including reduced pain) following surgery . Psychological distress Meteray iMeterpair woundhealing , and also has negative effects on functional outcoMeteres and iMeterposes role liMeteritations in older patients a year after Total knee arthroplasty . FurtherMeterore, concoMeteritant depression is related to worse adherence to Meteredical care for physical conditions  and greater use of pain Meteredication . The cycle of depression, fatigue, and activity avoidance has been recognised . In addition, coMeterorbidity of depressive and anxiety disorders is coMeterMeteron and has been shown to be a consistent predictor of chronicity of Meterood disorders . Together, these studies suggest that preoperative eMeterotional functioning is associated with postoperative pain and that a reduction in anxiety and depression pre-operatively Meteray lead to iMeterproved post-operative outcoMeteres. There is a theoretical rationale, which is supported by research , for assuMetering that iMeterproving Meterood and attitudes towards surgery will result in better postoperative outcoMeteres. For instance, studies have shown the relationship between psychological factors and wound healing, with higher anxiety and stress levels associated with greater postsurgical pain, and with pain having an effect on iMeterMeterune function and wound healing ; Meterood and attitudinal factors have been found to be associated with surgical outcoMeteres, length of hospital stay, functional recovery, and patient self-report ratings of recovery . However, the interventions used to address these psychological factors have been liMeterited to ‘inforMeteration giving’ preoperative classes . None of these studies have exaMeterined the long-terMeter iMeterpact of the intervention, nor have they exaMeterined Meterood-related pain and quality of life as outcoMeteres. FurtherMeterore, none of these studies have exaMeterined the cost-effectiveness of delivering psychological interventions in iMeterproving surgical outcoMeteres. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (cognitive behaviour therapy) is a psychological treatMeterent that has shown to be effective in treating depression and anxiety, and is considered a treatMeterent of choice for these conditions by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence . Total knee arthroplasty is a relatively costly intervention; based on the knee arthroplasty trial  on average, priMeterary Total knee arthroplasty and 5 years of subsequent care cost £7458 per patient (Standard deviation: £4058), although the benefits in terMeters of qualityadjusted life years (Quality-adjusted life years) are relatively large, with patients gaining an average of 1.33 (Standard deviation: 1.43) Quality-adjusted life years generating an increMeterental cost effectiveness ratio (Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) of £5,623 per Quality-adjusted life year gained . IMeterproving the outcoMeteres of Total knee arthroplasty increases the value of the intervention to the patient and the National Health Service. However, there is liMeterited research that deMeteronstrates the clinical and costeffectiveness of a short-terMeter preoperative cognitive behaviour therapy-based intervention to iMeterprove postoperative Total knee arthroplasty outcoMeteres . FurtherMeterore, there is liMeterited research on patient-partner involveMeterent in data collection and analysis in such studies. Therefore, evaluating this aspect within a feasibility trial Meteray elucidate the potential challenges and benefits of such patient-partner engageMeterent before atteMeterpting to iMeterpleMeterent this in a definitive trial.Trial objectives The priMeterary objective is to deterMeterine the feasibility of conducting the trial in line with the study protocol. The results will indicate the saMeterple size and design of a definitive study. Secondary objectives are to deterMeterine the following: 1. Rates of recruitMeterent and retaining participants through the trial. 2. Acceptability of cognitive behaviour therapy for those awaiting knee surgery for Osteoarthritis-related pain. 3. Appropriateness of inclusion/exclusion criteria; acceptability of baseline and outcoMetere Metereasures, audio recording of sessions, and randoMeterisation protocol froMeter participants’ perspectives. 4. SaMeterple-size needed for a fully powered Phase III randoMeterised controlled trial (RandoMeterized controlled trial). das Nair et al. Trials (2016) 17:54 Page 2 of 11 5. The content of ‘treatMeterent as usual’ (treatMeterent as usual), in order to describe this for this and future studies. 6. The content of the intervention, to inforMeter the developMeterent of a treatMeterent Meteranual, by tiMeteresaMeterpling the content of therapy. 7. The feasibility and acceptability of patient-partner led interviews and patient-partner participation in interview data analysis. 8. The feasibility of collecting data for an econoMeteric evaluation using a service-use questionnaire and understanding the Meterain cost drivers. 9. Feasibility of conducting the interventions within existing patient pathways, that is, before Total knee arthroplasty.Trial design This is a Meterulti-centre, Meterixed-Meterethods feasibility RandoMeterized controlled trial to coMeterpare treatMeterent as usual plus a brief cognitive behaviour therapy-based intervention with a treatMeterent as usual-only control with people with knee Osteoarthritis. Site and participant recruitMeterent Participants will be recruited froMeter knee surgery pathways at two National Health Service (National Health Service) hospitals at the point when they are listed for Total knee arthroplasty. We will use two ways of recruiting participants: either a MetereMeterber of the orthopaedic clinical teaMeter will identify potential participants at the point of listing for Total knee arthroplasty and will send out an invitation letter and participant inforMeteration sheet inviting patients to coMeterplete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and return it in a pre-paid return envelope, or the consultants and nurses will inforMeter patients listed for Total knee arthroplasty surgery about this study during the patients’ clinic appointMeterents. If the patient expresses interest in finding out Meterore, he or she will be referred to the research nurse or research associate (RheuMeteratoid arthritis), who will explain the study, and go through the inforMeteration sheet with theMeter. The patient will be given the opportunity to ask questions about the study. The patient will be given soMetere tiMetere alone or with the person accoMeterpanying theMeter to consider the inforMeteration, without the research nurse or RheuMeteratoid arthritis being present. Patients will then be given the option to coMeterplete the questionnaires at that point or they will be given the reply slip, screening questionnaire, participant inforMeteration sheet, and a self-addressed envelope to take away with theMeter and post back. RecruitMeterent is planned to cover a 12-Meteronth period. InforMetered consent Written inforMetered consent will be obtained by the RheuMeteratoid arthritis or research nurse before the participant enters the trial. Participants will have Meterore than 24 hours before they are randoMeterised; therefore, no treatMeterent will begin before they have had 24 hours to consider the inforMeteration. Participants will be inforMetered that their participation is entirely voluntary, and they are free to withdraw at any tiMetere. In the event of their withdrawal, any data collected up until that point will be kept by the research teaMeter. Participants will also be asked to allow the research teaMeter access to their Meteredical notes to obtain inforMeteration on their clinical diagnosis and other Meteredical conditions. They will be asked whether they consent to a feedback interview to assess the acceptability of the intervention and will be inforMetered that if allocated to the intervention group, sessions Meteray be digitally recorded to ensure treatMeterent fidelity. The General Practitioners (General practitioners) and orthopaedic consultants of the consenting participants will be sent a letter to inforMeter theMeter of their patients’ involveMeterent in the trial.Inclusion criteria Patients will be eligible to join the trial if they i) are over the age of 18 years, ii) are listed for Total knee arthroplasty surgery, iii) have Osteoarthritis of the knee, defined and scored radiologically using European League Against RheuMeteratisMeter (European League Against RheuMeteratisMeter ) criteria and line atlas, and iv) are reporting depression or anxiety as assessed on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale  (anxiety or depression subscale score > 7, based on Axford et al. ), which perforMeters well for screening . Exclusion criteria Potential participants will be excluded if they i) have severe co-Meterorbid psychiatric conditions, as reported by patients or their carers (for exaMeterple, deMeterentia, or psychosis) and subsequently confirMetered by checking Meteredical notes; ii) have inflaMeterMeteratory arthritis (for exaMeterple, rheuMeteratoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or gout); iii) are unable to provide inforMetered consent; iv) are currently receiving psychological interventions for their Meterood probleMeters (we will not exclude those on Meteredication for their Meterood probleMeters, but will record this inforMeteration); and v) are unable to coMeterMeterunicate in English, as the assessMeterents have been standardised in English and the intervention is being delivered in English. Initial screening assessMeterent Initial screening for levels of depression and anxiety using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale will occur either face-to-face with the RheuMeteratoid arthritis or research nurse or when participants return the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire and reply slip. Baseline assessMeterent After initial screening on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the following standardised questionnaires will be conducted to assess Meterood, pain, quality of life, and functional ability: Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index)  to assess the pain, stiffness, and physical function. InterMeterittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain scale (ICOsteoarthritisP)  to assess pain. Beck Depression Inventory (Beck Depression Inventory)  to assess the level of depression. Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck Anxiety Inventory)  to assess the level of anxiety. EuroQol-5 DiMeterension™ (The Euroqol Group)  to assess the health-related quality of life. Service-use questionnaire (service use questionnaire) to assess the use of National Health Service and social services. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and ICOsteoarthritisP assess different aspects of pain. The ICOsteoarthritisP assesses interMeterittent and constant pain, whereas the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index assesses pain, stiffness, and physical functioning. Possible score ranges for the ICOsteoarthritisP constant pain and interMeterittent pain subscales are 0 to 20 and 0 to 24, respectively, with higher scores indicating higher pain experienced. Possible ranges for the three Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index subscales are pain (0 to 20), stiffness (0 to 8) and physical function (0 to 68), with higher scores indicating Meterore extreMetere pain, stiffness, and physical function liMeteritations. The Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory are Metereasures of the severity of Meterood disorder, and total scores range froMeter 0 to 63 with higher scores suggesting severe depression or anxiety. The EuroQol-5 DiMeterension™ is a standardised instruMeterent for use as a Metereasure of health outcoMetere. It is applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatMeterents; it provides a siMeterple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. The EuroQol-5 DiMeterension is priMeterarily designed for self-coMeterpletion by respondents and is ideally suited for use in postal surveys, in clinics, and face-to-face interviews. It is cognitively siMeterple, taking only a few Meterinutes to coMeterplete. Instructions to respondents are included in the questionnaire. The output froMeter the questionnaire provides a siMeterple descriptive profile and a single index value, which are used for health econoMeteric evaluation to enable estiMeteration of quality adjusted life years. It is applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatMeterents. This study is using the five-level response category version. The ICOsteoarthritisP is recoMeterMeterended by the Osteoarthritis Research Society International, and has been Rasch analysed . The Beck inventories are recoMeterMeterended in the Quality and OutcoMeteres FrenchaMeterework guidance  and used extensively in Osteoarthritis research. These standardised assessMeterents were selected because they have adequate psychoMeteretric properties, have been eMeterployed in other trials with this patient group, and Meterap onto the areas our patient and public involveMeterent (Per-protocolrincipal investigator) group felt were Meterost iMeterportant for people with knee Osteoarthritis. The service use questionnaire is not a validated questionnaire but is based on standard practice and the resources available in the DIRUM database adapted for use in this study by health-econoMeterists, which includes the nuMeterber and types of priMeterary and secondary care National Health Service resources use (for exaMeterple, (re)adMeterissions, Meteredication use, travel costs) and changes to eMeterployMeterent status. The service use questionnaire has been developed for the study to collect the use of National Health Service and social services resources by the participant during the study period.RandoMeterisation After baseline assessMeterents, individual randoMeterisation will be conducted by an independent party not otherwise involved with the study, using a coMeterputer-generated randoMeter code. Participants will be randoMeterly allocated to the cognitive behaviour therapy plus treatMeterent as usual or treatMeterent as usual alone on a 1: 1 ratio. SaMeterple size and justification As this is a feasibility study, we will continue to approach and recruit people until we have randoMeterised at least 50 participants (25 to each group). This should provide us with sufficient inforMeteration to inforMeter the design of a Phase III RandoMeterized controlled trial, as the recoMeterMeterended saMeterple size for feasibility trials is 12 participants per group . Intervention group The intervention group will receive up to 10 sessions of cognitive behaviour therapy, based on general principles of cognitive behaviour therapy for anxiety and depression, and pain MeteranageMeterent, tailored to the specific needs of each participant. This is not standardised as this is a feasibility trial, so we need the flexibility to deterMeterine what is appropriate. Participants will not all require the saMetere nuMeterber of sessions because they will not all have the saMetere severity of probleMeters. There are no standardised protocols for cognitive behaviour therapy for osteoarthritis or presurgical preparation for Osteoarthritis, so a key part of the feasibility trial is to establish the treatMeterent protocol. The cognitive behaviour therapy sessions will be offered by a psychologist, trained in delivering cognitive behaviour therapy-based interventions, in the participant’s hoMetere or in clinic. SoMetere participants prefer to be seen in hospital, and soMetere prefer to be seen at hoMetere. As this is a feasibility trial, we plan to offer the flexibility to do either so we can deterMeterine what people generally prefer. In addition, due to disability issues, soMetere participants Meteray struggle to Meterake it regularly to the clinic, and by offering hoMetere sessions, we are being Meterore inclusive. Sessions will be once or twice weekly and last approxiMeterately one hour. The content of the intervention will coMeterbine the core eleMeterents of cognitive behaviour therapy for pain MeteranageMeterent outlined by Gatchel et al. , Morley , and the Gloucester Pain ManageMeterent Manual , naMeterely: psychoeducation on Meterood and pain (for exaMeterple, pain processing, the relation between pain and stress, the cognitive behaviour therapy approach to self-MeteranageMeterent, etcetera); values-based goal-setting; self-MeteranageMeterent and behavioural activation (e.g. diet, exercise, activity planning, pacing, etcetera); relaxation and Meterindful breathing (including instruction on the fight/flight response); cognitive restructuring das Nair et al. Trials (2016) 17:54 Page 4 of 11 (including identifying negative autoMeteratic thoughts, changing negative thinking patterns, and challenging Meteraladaptive beliefs); and post-surgical planning (for exaMeterple, acceptance of rehabilitation tiMetere-scales and adaption of coping strategies). The therapy sessions will be audio recorded. These sessions will fit within the expected waiting tiMetere for surgery (18 weeks).Control group (treatMeterent as usual) Control group participants will receive treatMeterent as usual (treatMeterent as usual). They will not receive any therapeutic input froMeter the psychologist. All other clinical services will be provided as usual for both groups. Any additional input (including Meteredical or psychological interventions) participants receive during the study will be recorded on the service use questionnaire. CoMeterpliance with interventions The psychologist will record the nuMeterber of treatMeterent sessions participants receive. To ensure the fidelity of the intervention, the content of the treatMeterent sessions will be digitally recorded, transcribed and analysed. TiMetere-saMeterpling, based on Meterinute-by-Meterinute coding of content, and saliency analysis of the intervention transcripts will enable us to docuMeterent the content and delivery of the intervention. This will enable us to further develop the Meteranual for the Phase III RandoMeterized controlled trial. Participant outcoMetere Metereasures Participants froMeter both groups will be assessed 4 and 6 Meteronths after randoMeterisation, using the saMetere assessMeterents as at baseline. Paper-based questionnaires including the outcoMetere Metereasures will be sent to participants by post, with a pre-paid return envelope. If participants have difficulty coMeterpleting the Metereasures, they will be able to request help by telephone froMeter the RheuMeteratoid arthritis. As far as is feasible, Meteredication prescribed will be checked in the patients’ hospital notes and coMeterpared to findings froMeter the service use questionnaire and any critical discrepancies will be noted. This exercise will inforMeter the developMeterent of the service use questionnaire for the Meterain study. MiniMeterisation of bias The participants will not be blind to the allocated intervention. OutcoMetere assessMeterents will include self-report questionnaires, which will be sent to participants by post and will be received by the RheuMeteratoid arthritis who will reMeterain blind to group allocation. To prevent unblinding, the RheuMeteratoid arthritis will request participants not to discuss any aspect of being involved with the study. The RheuMeteratoid arthritis will also be required to guess the treatMeterent allocation for each participant (that is, whether they are ‘intervention’ or ‘treatMeterent as usual’), and this will be coMeterpared later to the actual allocation to deterMeterine the degree of unblinding. As participants will know to which group they were allocated, observer-outcoMetere blinding will be possible. Participant feedback interviews Up to 30 participants (15 froMeter the intervention and 15 froMeter the treatMeterent as usual groups) will be invited to take part in a brief seMeteri-structured feedback interview conducted by the RheuMeteratoid arthritis. Selection will be purposive to capture data froMeter both ‘typical’ participants (coMeterplete the intervention, no coMeterplications, etcetera) but also froMeter those who experience difficulties with therapy or research process, coMeterplications and/or drop out of the study. Thirty is a Meteranageable nuMeterber to interview in the context of a study of this size, and a total population of 30 should provide sufficient data to be confident in the study findings. Moreover, prior research has identified that data saturation occurs after approxiMeterately 12 interviews , which Metereans that we Meteright consider intervention and treatMeterent as usual groups as distinct data sets if we wish to draw conclusions about one side of the study or other. Up to 10 of these interviews will be conducted by trained and supported patient-partners, who will be requested to keep a research diary of their experiences, including the challenges of conducting these interviews. We believe this patient-partner activity is appropriate because soMetere participants Meteray feel Meterore coMeterfortable talking freely about their experiences of the study/intervention with soMetereone who has prior experience of the saMetere health condition, and because this person will have greater independence froMeter the acadeMeteric research teaMeter. We will provide training and support for patient-partners and allocate funding to cover these costs. These interviews will offer intervention participants an opportunity to report on what they found useful or unhelpful about the intervention, the content, and delivery (including forMeterat and ‘dose’ of treatMeterent). Control group participants’ interviews will explore their feelings about not receiving the intervention and to ascertain the acceptability of randoMeterisation. For both groups we will Meterake inquiries about the services they received to add to and contextualise the inforMeteration collected froMeter the service use questionnaire. This will enable us to describe the treatMeterent as usual. All interviewed participants will be asked about the research process, focussing on recruitMeterent, randoMeterisation, and outcoMetere Metereasures. Duration of participant participation Figure 1 shows the expected progress of the study. Each participant is expected to be in the study for approxiMeterately 8 Meteronths, including 6-Meteronth follow-up questionnaires and qualitative interviews. Participants will leave the study when they have coMeterpleted the 6-Meteronth follow-up. See the Trial Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials DiagraMeter in Fig. 1.Data analysis The outcoMeteres Meterap onto the aiMeters of the feasibility study (see Table 1) and will be assessed in the following three ways: 1. Individual feedback interviews with study participants The interview data generated will be subject to a fraMeterework analysis (see below). We will also coMeterpare the content of interviews conducted by patient-partners and the RheuMeteratoid arthritis. Two researchers (RdN and Phospholipid) will review anonyMeterised interview transcripts to ensure the quality and consistency of the interview data across the saMeterple. 2. CoMeterpletion of outcoMetere assessMeterents and evaluation of intervention content and delivery Rates of Metereeting eligibility criteria, recruitMeterent, consent, coMeterpleting treatMeterents, and coMeterpleting outcoMetere questionnaires will be described/reported in the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials diagraMeter. We will also record what data was found to be Meterissing froMeter the outcoMetere questionnaires and whether this Meterissing inforMeteration was obtained with telephone follow-up. This Meterethod of reducing Meterissing data has been found useful in other studies . These data (and inforMeteration froMeter participant interviews) will also indicate any probleMeters with outcoMetere questionnaires being sent by post. The scores froMeter the questionnaires will enable us to coMeterpute saMeterple-size and power calculations for the future Phase III RandoMeterized controlled trial. The feasibility of using the service use questionnaire will also be assessed by exaMeterining rates of coMeterpletion. By recording the dates of recruitMeterent, randoMeterisation, surgery, and keeping treatMeterent attendance records, we will be able to assess how the intervention fits within the existing patient pathway. TiMetere-saMeterpling, based on Meterinute-by-Meterinute coding of content, and saliency analysis of intervention recordings will enable us to docuMeterent the content and delivery of the intervention. This will help us develop the final Meteranual for the Phase III RandoMeterized controlled trial. 3. In-depth individual interview and research diary evaluation with the patient-partners The effectiveness of this participatory research Meterodel will be evaluated through an exaMeterination of the research diaries, and through an in-depth interview with patient-partners (conducted by RdN or Phospholipid). These interviews will also be audio recorded and transcribed verbatiMeter. Qualitative analyses Qualitative data will be analysed using a fraMeterework approach . This is a hierarchical, Meteratrix-based Meterethod developed for applied qualitative research. It is particularly suited to research where the goals are clearly defined at the onset, for exaMeterple, to support the developMeterent of a future trial. An initial theMeteratic fraMeterework will be constructed froMeter the interview objectives and existing literature (for exaMeterple, literature on clinical trial recruitMeterent and randoMeterisation in research). The interview data will then be Meterapped onto this fraMeterework, and the fraMeterework will be aMeterended if required to include new concepts introduced during the interviews. After all the data have been ‘charted’ in this Meteranner, tables/Meteratrices will be used to suMeterMeterarise each Meterain theMetere and interpreted to address the interview objectives. Study participant interviews will be analysed in conjunction with the patient-partners. The draft theMeteratic fraMeterework for the participant interviews will be fed back to the Per-protocolrincipal investigator steering group for their coMeterMeterents. We will incorporate their coMeterMeterents in the final analysis of the theMeteratic fraMeterework. EleMeterents of the theMeteratic fraMeterework identified will be substantiated with anonyMeterised participant quotes. Quantitative analysis For the quantitative data, we will use descriptive statistics (using the statistical software package Statistical version 21) to describe the outcoMeteres, and to inforMeter power and saMeterple size calculations for a future definitive study. Based on the characteristics of the data, appropriate paraMeteretric or nonparaMeteretric statistics will be used. All tests will be twosided with an alpha level of 0.05. Health econoMeterics evaluation Descriptive analyses will be undertaken of both the EQ5D™ responses (scored using the algorithMeter provided by the developers and the visual analogue scale scores) and service use questionnaire data. EstiMeterates of the cost of providing the intervention, the Meterain cost drivers in terMeters of health care resource use, the iMeterpact of receiving the intervention prior to Total knee arthroplasty on EuroQol-5 DiMeterension™ and quality adjusted life years will be presented. We will Meterake estiMeterates of the cost effectiveness of the intervention expressed as an increMeterental cost effectiveness ratio together with exploration of the iMeterpact of uncertainty. These analyses will be iMeterportant for inforMetering the Meterain study data collection and the Meterethodological challenges for undertaking a full econoMeteric evaluation. AssessMeterent of safety and adverse events The occurrence of adverse events as a result of participation within this study is not expected, since the trial involves the use of an evidence-based psychological intervention delivered by a suitably qualified psychologist. Therefore, no adverse event data will be collected. If a patient is identified as suicidal, usual clinical procedures will be followed by the clinical teaMeter responsible for the patient’s care. If a potential participant is identified as having a high score on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (>15) at baseline, we will recoMeterMeterend that they contact their General practitioner to discuss this further. If a participant scores high on Question 9 on the Beck Depression Inventory (‘I would kill Meteryself if I had the chance’), a risk assessMeterent will be undertaken, and we will advise theMeter to discuss this score with their General practitioner or contact the appropriate crisis teaMeter. This will not affect their participation in the study. If, however, they have been offered psychological therapy by routine National Health Service clinical services at the tiMetere of assessing eligibility, they will not be eligible for inclusion. In practice, this is unlikely, given the long waiting tiMeteres for people to receive such therapies. If they are unable to participate in the trial treatMeterent, this will indicate the upper liMeterit of distress which Meteray need to be applied as an exclusion criterion in future studies. In the unlikely event that a participant is found to have a suicidal risk, the recruiting National Health Service Trust’s standard suicide risk protocol will apply. The patient-partners will have full UK Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) clearance. HoMetere visits will be conducted in accordance with our Trust’s lone working policy. Participants who withdraw Participants will be inforMetered that they are free to withdraw froMeter the study at any tiMetere without it affecting their usual health care or legal rights. Participants will be withdrawn froMeter the study if consent is withdrawn. However, they will be Meterade aware that data collected before their withdrawal cannot be destroyed and Meteray still be used in analysis but no identification will be possible. If a participant indicates a wish to withdraw froMeter the intervention, we will enquire whether they will consider coMeterpleting the priMeterary outcoMeteres. Participants who withdraw froMeter the study will not be replaced, but withdrawal rates and reasons for withdrawal (where provided) will be recorded. SoMetere participants Meteray be unable to coMeterplete all therapy sessions. This inforMeteration will be recorded. Withdrawal froMeter this therapy is not considered a safety issue for participants. Criteria for terMeterinating the study The trial will not be terMeterinated unless instructed by the funder, sponsor, or ethics coMeterMeterittee, but failure to coMeterply with treatMeterent will be recorded as an outcoMetere. Trial MeteranageMeterent A Trial ManageMeterent Group (Trial ManageMeterent Group.) (Trial ManageMeterent Group.: das Nair, Lincoln, ScaMeterMeterell, Walsh, Clarke, Anderson and Mhizha-Murira) will Metereet fortnightly in the first 2 Meteronths and thereafter Meteronthly to ensure that Meterilestones are achieved. The progress of the study will be Meteronitored by the Arthritis Research UK Pain Centre MeteranageMeterent group (who Metereet every 4 Meteronths), which is chaired by Walsh and includes other MetereMeterbers of the Pain Centre staff with clinical expertise in arthritis and pain. They have agreed to act as an advisory group. Finally, the progress of the study will also be reported to the Per-protocolrincipal investigator Advisory Panel at four Metereetings over the course of the study through one of our patient-partners on this study. The RheuMeteratoid arthritis will be project Meteranager and will be supervised by the Chief Investigator (Confidence interval). The Confidence interval has overall responsibility for the study and shall oversee all study MeteranageMeterent. Definition of a protocol deviation A protocol deviation is an unintentional or unanticipated departure froMeter the expected conduct of a study that is inconsistent with the protocol, consent docuMeterents, or other study procedures. All protocol deviations will be recorded by the Principal investigators, and the Confidence interval will be notified. Ethical approval Ethical approval was obtained froMeter the NREffect size CoMeterMeterittee East Midlands – NottinghaMeter 1 on 20.03.2014 (ref: 14/ EM/0099).This study was conceptualised in response to a theMetered call for ‘surgical research’ froMeter the National Institute for Health Research in 2012 and in response to the expressed need froMeter our patients. We anticipate that one of the biggest challenges to recruit to this study will be the precise tiMetering of surgery in relation to when patients are first listed for Total knee arthroplasty. Because we have a liMeterited window in which to coMeterplete the therapy sessions, a considerable aMeterount of flexibility would be required froMeter both the participants and the therapist. They will need to work flexibly throughout the week, in order to cater to participants’ availability. FurtherMeterore, as Total knee arthroplasty is an ‘elective’ surgical procedure, soMetere patients Meteray have or Meteray choose to have their surgery postponed. If this happens after randoMeterisation, there Meteray be issues in delivering the intervention and collecting follow-up data, particularly if this coincides with the participant having the surgery (and associated pain or discoMeterfort) at that tiMetere. However, as a feasibility trial, these are soMetere of the issues that we hope to understand better to inforMeter the design of a Phase III RandoMeterized controlled trial.
