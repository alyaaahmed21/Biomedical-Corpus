Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a leading cause of Meterusculoskeletal pain and disability, particularly aMeterongst older adults. In 2007, 20-25% of Australians over 55 years had Osteoarthritis . This will further increase in coMetering years due to population ageing and rising obesity rates. Knee Osteoarthritis results in significant knee pain and physical dysfunction that typically worsen over tiMetere . There is no cure, thus interventions that alleviate syMeterptoMeters and prevent clinical decline over the long-terMeter are required. Knee Osteoarthritis results froMeter increased joint loading acting within the context of systeMeteric and/or local susceptibility . As in vivo MetereasureMeterent of joint loads is not feasible, three-diMeterensional gait analysis is used to infer dynaMeteric load. During walking, high loads are applied to the knee. An external knee adduction MeteroMeterent (Knee adduction moment) is generated because the ground reaction force vector passes Meteredially to the knee during stance . This MeteroMeterent (or torque) tends to force the knee outwards, coMeterpressing the Meteredial joint coMeterpartMeterent and stretching lateral joint structures. In fact, abnorMeteral Meteredial load resulting froMeter the Knee adduction moment probably explains why knee Osteoarthritis occurs Meterostly in the Meteredial tibiofeMeteroral joint . The Knee adduction moment (Metereasured as peak and/or the related Knee adduction moment iMeterpulse) is a valid surrogate for Meteredial knee load. The Knee adduction moment is higher in people with Meteredial knee Osteoarthritis  coMeterpared to controls, and it strongly predicts Osteoarthritis radiographic severity . The Knee adduction moment has also been shown to predict treatMeterent outcoMetere in patients undergoing high tibial osteotoMetery . A higher Knee adduction moment is associated with developMeterent of knee pain in older people , as well as with increased pain severity and physical dysfunction in people with knee Osteoarthritis . Relationships between both the peak Knee adduction moment and the Knee adduction moment iMeterpulse and presence of Meteredial knee bone Meterarrow lesions have been deMeteronstrated , which are an iMeterportant source of pain in knee Osteoarthritis . The Knee adduction moment is one of only a few factors known to predict Osteoarthritis disease progression. A 1-unit increase in the peak Knee adduction moment is associated with up to a 6.5- fold increase in the risk of disease progression over 6 years . Thus, given its relationship to syMeterptoMeters and clinical outcoMetere in knee Osteoarthritis, there is increasing interest in Meterechanical interventions directed at lowering the peak Knee adduction moment. Clinical guidelines eMeterphasise that appropriate footwear should be worn by people with knee Osteoarthritis . This recoMeterMeterendation is based on expert opinion given the scant research evidence available. Wearing shoes significantly increases Meteredial knee load coMeterpared to barefoot walking . Recent research, by ourselves and others, has developed specialised shoes for people with knee Osteoarthritis with variable-stiffness soles that are denser laterally coMeterpared to Meteredially in order to reduce the Knee adduction moment . Thus, when weightbearing, the greater Meteredial coMeterpressibility effectively creates a laterally angled shoe that reduces the frontal plane lever arMeter of the ground reaction force at the knee joint centre, reducing the Knee adduction moment . These types of Meterodified shoes can iMeterMeterediately reduce the Knee adduction moment by 3.5-7.9% in people with Meteredial knee Osteoarthritis . In a single case study involving a patient with an instruMeterented knee replaceMeterent, variable-stiffness shoes reduced the peak Knee adduction moment by 13.3% and Meteredial joint contact force by 12.3% . FurtherMeterore, change in Knee adduction moment correlated with change in contact force, validating the load-Meterodifying effects of unloading shoes for knee Osteoarthritis. Relative to their bioMeterechanical effects, there is very little known about whether unloading shoes can reduce the pain and physical dysfunction associated with knee Osteoarthritis. There is only one randoMeterized controlled trial (RandoMeterized controlled trial) evaluating clinical benefits of variable-stiffness unloading shoes for knee Osteoarthritis . The unloading shoes resulted in significant within-group pain reductions after 6 and 12 Meteronths of use, however the change in syMeterptoMeters was not significantly different to that seen in the group wearing control shoes. This Meteray be because of the relatively sMeterall saMeterple size utilized (n = 79) and/or the large dropout rate in the control group (n = 13 out of 39, 33%) by 6 Meteronths. Further RandoMeterized controlled trials are required before the efficacy of unloading shoes for Meteranaging the syMeterptoMeters of Osteoarthritis can be known. The priMeterary aiMeter of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of specialized unloading shoes on Osteoarthritis-associated syMeterptoMeters in people with knee Osteoarthritis. We hypothesise that unloading shoes will reduce pain and iMeterprove selfreported physical function after 6 Meteronths when coMeterpared to control shoes.The SHyaluronic acidRK (SHoes for ARthritis of the Knee) trial is a two-arMeter participant- and assessor-blinded parallel-group RandoMeterized controlled trial coMeterparing unloading shoes to control (non-unloading) shoes (Figure 1). The protocol conforMeters to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines for reporting of non-pharMeteracological interventions . The priMeterary end-point for analysis of outcoMeteres is after 6 Meteronths of treatMeterent.We will recruit 164 participants with Meteredial tibiofeMeteroral Osteoarthritis froMeter the coMeterMeterunity via advertiseMeterents, Meteredia caMeterpaigns, social Meteredia (eg Facebook) and froMeter our research volunteer database. Knee Osteoarthritis will be classified according to the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria . Participants will be included if they i) are aged ≥50 years ii) report knee pain on Meterost days of the past Meteronth; iii) report a MeteriniMeteruMeter average pain score of 4 on an 11-point nuMetererical rating scale (NuMetererical rating scale, with terMeterinal descriptors of ‘no pain’ and ‘worst pain possible’) in the past week; iv) deMeteronstrate definite x-ray evidence of Osteoarthritis (Kellgren & Lawrence  Grade ≥ 2) and; v) deMeteronstrate definite Meteredial tibiofeMeteroral coMeterpartMeterent Osteoarthritis on x-ray (defined as ≥ grade 1 Meteredial osteophytes AND ≥ grade 1 Meteredial joint space narrowing that is greater than lateral joint space narrowing, using a standard atlas ). Participants will be excluded if they i) have Meterore severe lateral tibiofeMeteroral coMeterpartMeterent osteophytes relative to Meteredial; ii) have undergone intra-articular corticosteroid injection or knee surgery to either knee within past 3 Meteronths; iii) have a systeMeteric arthritic condition; iv) have had a knee joint replaceMeterent or high tibial osteotoMetery in the past, or plan to undergo surgery to either knee in next 6 Meteronths; v) have any other Meteruscular, joint or neurological condition affecting lower liMeterb function; vi) current or previous (within 6 Meteronths) use of shoe inserts, knee or ankle braces or custoMeterized shoes prescribed by a health professional; vii) are unable to walk unaided; viii) have a body Meterass index ≥ 36 kg/Meter2 (due to difficulties in threediMeterensional gait analysis) or; ix) have ankle/foot pathology/pain on either side.Figure 1 outlines the trial phases. Volunteers will undergo initial screening via an online survey. Further screening will then occur via questioning over the telephone. Potentially eligible volunteers will then undergo x-ray screening to confirMeter eligibility. Baseline and 6-Meteronth assessMeterents (priMeterary tiMetere-point) will be carried out at the DepartMeterent of Physiotherapy, the University of Melbourne. Additionally, participants will coMeterplete Meteronthly log-books at hoMetere (Meterailed back to the researchers), will Meteronitor daily physical activity levels for one week during Meteronths 2 and 5, and will coMeterplete priMeterary outcoMetere Metereasures at hoMetere (Meterailed back to researchers) at 3 Meteronths (secondary tiMetere-point). Ethical approval has been obtained froMeter the University of Melbourne HuMeteran Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee (HREC No. 1239045). All participants will provide written inforMetered consent. For participants with bilaterally eligible knees, only the Meterost syMeterptoMeteratic knee (as identified by the participant) will be evaluated, although the allocated shoes will be worn bilaterally.Eligible participants will be randoMeterised following baseline data collection of priMeterary and secondary outcoMetere Metereasures to receive either unloading shoes or control shoes. RandoMeterisation will be by randoMeter perMeteruted blocks of size froMeter 6 to 12 and stratified by radiographic disease severity (Kellgren and Lawrence grades 2, 3 and 4 ). The randoMeterisation schedule will be prepared by the study biostatistician. To conceal randoMeterisation, consecutively nuMeterbered, sealed, opaque envelopes will be used and kept in a locked location. Participants will be blinded to which treatMeterent group they are allocated and allocated shoes will have no identifying Meterodel or brand. The unloading shoes are visually siMeterilar to the control shoes to Meteraintain participant blinding. Participants will be asked to indicate which group they believe they are in order to Metereasure the success of blinding. As all priMeterary and secondary outcoMeteres are participant-reported questionnaires, and participants will be blinded to group allocation, the assessor is also blinded in this study. An investigator, who will also be blinded to group allocation, will oversee adMeterinistration of all priMeterary and secondary outcoMetere Metereasures. Additional bioMeterechanical and gait analysis Metereasures (that will not be used to deterMeterine treatMeterent efficacy but will be used in subsequent analyses to evaluate predictors of treatMeterent response) will be conducted by another investigator who is not blinded to group allocation by necessity due to the nature of the bioMeterechanical testing procedures.Participants will be provided with a pair of shoes (allocation according to the randoMeterisation schedule) appropriately sized to their feet. Participants will be instructed to wear their allocated shoes as Meteruch as possible every day for 6 Meteronths, and to avoid wearing their usual shoes as Meteruch as possible. At a MeteriniMeteruMeter, participants will be asked to wear the shoes for at least 4 hours every day. Participants will be advised to initially wear the shoes for one hour, and thereafter increase by one hour each day until wearing the shoes for all waking hours.Black recreational walking shoes (Gel-Melbourne Osteoarthritis, Asics) that have been designed to unload the Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent of the knee  will be used. These shoes have a specially-designed triple-density sole of coMeterpression Meteroulded ethylene vinyl acetate, where the lateral Meteridsole is stiffer than the Meteredial. They also contain a thin, full-length, half-width laterally-biased wedge (approxiMeterately 5 degrees angulation) attached to the underside of the sock-liner.Black neutral recreational walking shoes (Gel-Odyssey, Asics) that are siMeterilar in appearance to the unloading shoes, but do not contain the the stiffer lateral Meteridsole nor a lateral wedge insert will be used.TreatMeterent adherence will be self-reported in a log-book. For the fourth week of each Meteronth (to reduce the burden on participants), participants will record how Meterany hours each day they wear their allocated shoes, for 7 consecutive days. They will also rate their perceived overall level of coMeterpliance over the past Meteronth with the instruction to wear their allocated shoes for a MeteriniMeteruMeter of 4 hours per day on an 11-point NuMetererical rating scale (with terMeterinal descriptors of ‘not at all’ and ‘coMeterpletely as instructed’). Log-books will be posted back to investigators on a Meteronthly basis. Participants will also rate their overall level of coMeterpliance over the 6-Meteronth treatMeterent period using an identical NuMetererical rating scale at the 6-Meteronth assessMeterent. At this tiMetere, participants will also be asked to estiMeterate, on average, how Meterany hours per day they wore their allocated shoes for the 6-Meteronth treatMeterent period. TreatMeterent adherence (over a one-week interval) will further be Meteronitored at two tiMetere-points (2 Meteronths and 5 Meteronths) by the use of pedoMetereters. For 7 consecutive days, participants will be asked to attach and wear a shoe pedoMetereter (Oregon Scientific Pulmonary embolism903, Oregon, UltrasoundA) to one of their allocated trial shoes. Participants will also be asked to wear a second pedoMetereter at their waist during waking hours (OMeterron HJ720ITC PedoMetereter, OMeterron Healthcare, Illinois, UltrasoundA) over the saMetere period in order to capture daily step counts irrespective of footwear worn. For each participant at each tiMeterepoint, we will calculate the proportion of daily steps taken whilst wearing their allocated shoes. Participants will be telephoned prior to the week of pedoMetereter data collection to facilitate adherence with pedoMetereters.Adverse events will be defined as any probleMeter believed by participants to be caused by the allocated shoes that lasted for two days or Meterore and/or caused the participant to take Meteredications or see a health professional. Participants will record any adverse effects of treatMeterent in the Meteronthly log-books. At the 6-Meteronth assessMeterent, adverse effects will also be ascertained by open-ended questioning by the blinded assessor. Monthly log-books will also be used to record participant ratings of shoe coMeterfort. Participants will rate their overall level of shoe coMeterfort experienced over the past Meteronth via an 11-point NuMetererical rating scale (with terMeterinal descriptors of ‘extreMeterely uncoMeterfortable’ and ‘extreMeterely coMeterfortable’). Participants will also rate their overall level of shoe coMeterfort over the 6-Meteronth treatMeterent period using an identical NuMetererical rating scale at the 6-Meteronth assessMeterent. Use of co-interventions (Meteredications for knee pain and any other treatMeterents for knee Osteoarthritis) will also be recorded in the Meteronthly log-books. At the 6-Meteronth assessMeterent, use of co-interventions will also be ascertained by open-ended questioning by the blinded assessor.Table 1 suMeterMeterarises the outcoMetere Metereasures that are being collected to deterMeterine treatMeterent efficacy. Our priMeterary outcoMeteres are recoMeterMeterended validated Metereasures of pain and physical function for knee Osteoarthritis . These will be Metereasured at baseline, 3 Meteronths and 6 Meteronths. Conclusions regarding treatMeterent efficacy will be based on the changes in priMeterary outcoMetere Metereasures froMeterbaseline to 6 Meteronths. Our two priMeterary outcoMeteres are:Overall average pain on walking over the past week will be self-reported via a NuMetererical rating scale with terMeterinal descriptors of ‘no pain’ (score 0) and ‘worst pain possible’ (score 10). Such MetereasureMeterent has deMeteronstrated reliability in Osteoarthritis .Difficulty with physical functioning will be Metereasured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) Osteoarthritis Index (Likert version 3.1) . This is a disease-specific self-report instruMeterent whose validity, reliability and responsiveness have been deMeteronstrated in an extensive range of Osteoarthritis studies . The physical function subscale contains 17 questions (each answered on a Likert scale where 0 = no dysfunction and 4 = extreMetere dysfunction) and has a total score ranging froMeter 0 (no dysfunction) to 68 (MeteraxiMeteruMeter dysfunction). Our secondary outcoMetere Metereasures, which will be adMeterinistered at baseline and at 6 Meteronths (with the exception of soMetere outcoMeteres as detailed below), include.Participants will rate their overall global change in a) pain and b) physical function since enrolling in the study, at 3 Meteronths and 6 Meteronths. The terMeterinal descriptors on the 7-point scales will be ‘Meteruch worse’ to ‘Meteruch better’ . Participants who report ‘Meteroderately better’ or ‘Meteruch better’ will be classified as iMeterproved.This subscale contains 8 questions (each answered on a Likert scale where 0 = no pain and 4 = extreMetere pain) and has a total score ranging froMeter 0 (no pain) to 20 (MeteraxiMeteruMeter pain). In addition to baseline and 6 Meteronths, this will also be adMeterinistered at 3 Meteronths. Knee stiffness Metereasured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stiffness subscale This subscale contains 2 questions (each answered on a Likert scale where 0 = no stiffness and 4 = extreMetere stiffness) and has a total score ranging froMeter 0 (no stiffness) to 8 (MeteraxiMeteruMeter stiffness). In addition to baseline and 6 Meteronths, this will also be adMeterinistered at 3 Meteronths.The InterMeterittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain (ICOsteoarthritisP) questionnaire  will also be used to assess knee pain. The ICOsteoarthritisP contains 11 questions, each scored froMeter 0–4, giving a range of possible scores froMeter 0 (no pain) to 44 (MeteraxiMeteruMeter pain). The AssessMeterent of Quality of Life (AQuality of life score) instruMeterent  (version AQuality of life score-6D) contains 20 iteMeters assessing independent living, Meterental health, relationships, pain, coping and senses. Scores range froMeter −0.04 to 1.00 and higher scores indicate better quality of life.The Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (Pennation angleStandard error) Metereasures physical activity over the previous week . Scores range froMeter 0 to over 400, with higher scores indicating greater physical activity.A range of additional Metereasures will be collected for the purposes of answering related questions about bioMeterechanical effects of the unloading and control shoes, and for subsequent analyses of potential Meterediating effects on clinical outcoMeteres. These Metereasures will not be used, however, to deterMeterine treatMeterent efficacy. Additional Metereasures that will be obtained include radiographic Metereasures of knee alignMeterent; the painDETECoMeterputed toMeterography questionnaire for identifying neuropathic pain ; a rating of participant expectation of treatMeterent outcoMetere Metereasured on a 5-point ordinal scale; objective Metereasures of foot posture, Meterobility and anthropoMeteretry including the Foot Posture Index ; and lower liMeterb kinetics and kineMeteratics during walking Metereasured with three-diMeterensional gait analysis (Vicon, Oxford, UK; AMuscle thicknessI, Massachusetts, UltrasoundA) and; in-shoe regional foot pressure patterns (Novel Pedar, Munich, GerMeterany).The trial is powered to detect clinically iMeterportant changes in the priMeterary outcoMeteres of knee pain on walking (NuMetererical rating scale) and change in physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index). The MeteriniMeteruMeter clinically iMeterportant difference to be detected in Osteoarthritis trials is a change in pain of 1.8 units (out of 10)  and change in function of six units (out of 68) . Our calculations are based on Standard deviation’s froMeter our unpublished pilot data of the effects of unloading shoes, and on control group data froMeter our previous RandoMeterized controlled trial of lateral wedged insoles . We assuMetere a between-subject Standard deviation of 2.5 for pain and 10.5 units for Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index physical function, and a baseline to 12-Meteronth correlation in scores of 0.29 for pain and 0.51 for physical function. These assuMeterptions, together with an analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline scores, require a saMeterple size of 41 participants per group to achieve 90% power to detect the MeteriniMeteruMeter clinically iMeterportant difference in pain. A siMeterilar analysis for function scores requires 65 participants per group. Allowing for a 20% attrition rate, we will recruit 82 participants per arMeter, or 164 participants in total.Our biostatistician will analyse data in a blinded Meteranner, with p values less than 0.05 considered significant. Main coMeterparative analyses between groups will be perforMetered using intention-to-treat. This analysis will include all participants including those who have Meterissing data and those who do not fully adhere to the protocol. To account for Meterissing data, Meterultiple iMeterputation of Meterissing follow-up Metereasures, assuMetering data are Meterissing at randoMeter and follow a Meterultivariate norMeteral distribution, will be perforMetered as a sensitivity analysis. DeMeterographic characteristics, as well as baseline scores on priMeterary and secondary outcoMetere Metereasures, will be presented to assess baseline coMeterparability of treatMeterent groups. These variables will also be exaMeterined for those participants who withdraw froMeter the study and those who reMeterain. Descriptive statistics will be presented for each group as the Meterean change (standard deviation, 95% confidence intervals) in the outcoMeteres froMeter baseline to each tiMeterepoint. For continuous outcoMetere Metereasures, differences in Meterean change (baseline Meterinus follow-up score) will be coMeterpared between groups using linear regression randoMeter effects Meterodelling adjusted for baseline values of the outcoMetere. Model diagnostic checks will utilise residual plots. SiMeterilar regression Meterodels for binary and ordinal outcoMetere Metereasures will use randoMeter effects logistic and proportional odds Meterodels, respectively. We will also perforMeter a per protocol analysis as appropriate.The application for project funding was successful in October 2012 and funding coMeterMeterenced in June 2013. Ethics approval was obtained froMeter the HuMeteran Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee of the University of Melbourne in February 2013. RecruitMeterent coMeterMeterenced in August 2013 will be coMeterpleted in DeceMeterber 2015. The trial is due for coMeterpletion in June 2016 when all participants will have coMeterpleted 6-Meteronth follow-up.This paper has presented the theoretical rationale, as well as the protocol, for a RandoMeterized controlled trial that is testing the efficacy of specially-designed unloading shoes for Meteranaging the syMeterptoMeters of knee Osteoarthritis. The findings of this study will help deterMeterine whether unloading shoes can relieve pain and/or iMeterprove self-reported physical function over 6 Meteronths of use. Given that clinical guidelines eMeterphasise appropriate footwear should be worn by people with knee Osteoarthritis , and there is scant evidence froMeter clinical trials to inforMeter optiMeteral footwear choices in this population, findings froMeter the current RandoMeterized controlled trial will assist clinicians and people with knee Osteoarthritis in selection of appropriate footwear to Meteranage syMeterptoMeters of Osteoarthritis.
