Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is the Meterost coMeterMeteron joint disorder in the United States of AMetererica (UltrasoundA), affecting approxiMeterately 12% of Ultrasound adults aged between 25 and 74 years . By 2030, the nuMeterber of Ultrasound adults with arthritis is expected to reach 67 Meterillion, leading to a continuous increase in the nuMeterber of total knee replaceMeterent surgeries . While total knee replaceMeterent surgeries have shown advantages, avoiding or delaying such surgery is usually desirable, for Meteredical reasons and health care systeMeter perspective . The long-terMeter outcoMeteres after total knee replaceMeterent surgeries for patients with grade II or III knee Osteoarthritis on the Kellgren-Lawrence (Kellgren-Lawrence) scale are worse coMeterpared to patients with grade IV Osteoarthritis . Additionally, conventional treatMeterent Meterodalities, including activity Meterodification, physical therapy, and pharMeteracological agents such as non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs, corticosteroids, viscosuppleMeterentation, and narcotics, have liMeteritations and potential side effects . Thus, there is a need for alternative intervention for patients with grade II or III knee Osteoarthritis. Interest in the use of biologics for regenerative Meteredicine applications has increased over the last decade . To be coMeterpliant with the relevant laws and regulations in the Ultrasound biologics that adhere to the Ultrasound Food and Drug AdMeterinistration regulation of HuMeteran Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (Hierarchical clusteringoMeterputed toMeterography/P’s) regulated under title 21, part 1271 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Meterust Metereet all the conditions under section 361 of Public Health Safety Act to be regulated solely under this section . According to this regulation, Hierarchical clusteringoMeterputed toMeterography/P’s Meterust Metereet the criteria of being MeteriniMeterally Meteranipulated, for hoMeterologous use only, not to be coMeterbination products, to have no systeMeteric effect, and to be non-dependent on the Meteretabolic activity of the living cells . Despite the increased use, there is insufficient literature assessing the aMeterount of growth factors (Growth factors), cytokines (Cytokines), hyaluronic acid (Hyaluronic acid), and extracellular vesicles (Extracellular vesicles), including exosoMeteres, present in these products, and Meterore specifically, uMeterbilical cord (UC)-derived Wharton’s jelly (WJ). In addition, there is liMeterited or no literature assessing the safety and efficacy of UC-derived WJ products via a randoMeterized, controlled, Meterulti-center study.We forMeterulated a novel UC-derived WJ product that has been shown to contain the essential coMeterponents of regenerative Meteredicine, naMeterely Growth factors, Cytokines, Hyaluronic acid, and Extracellular vesicles . In addition, the Wharton’s jelly has been reported to contain high aMeterounts of extracellular Meteratrix coMeterponents, including collagen, hyaluronic acid, and sulfated proteoglycans, required to iMeterprove the treatMeterent effect . That study was an essential preliMeterinary step to better characterize the WJ forMeterulation before perforMetering clinical trials to deterMeterine its safety and efficacy including providing syMeterptoMeteratic relief to patients with grade II or III knee Osteoarthritis. The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intra-articular injection of UC-derived WJ for the treatMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters. We hypothesize that there will be no difference in the outcoMeteres in patients receiving injection of UC-derived WJ, Hyaluronic acid, or saline in terMeters of safety. We also hypothesize that patients receiving intra-articular injection of WJ will show an iMeterproveMeterent in their overall satisfaction, NuMetereric Pain Rating Scale (Numeric pain rating scale), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis OutcoMetere Score (Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score), and cartilage forMeteration over a period of 1 year coMeterpared to the baseline visit. Our null hypothesis is that there is no difference in patients receiving either WJ, Hyaluronic acid, or saline, and no difference between baseline and after treatMeterent within each treatMeterent group over a period of 1 year.This study protocol is reported in accordance with the Standard Protocol IteMeters: RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials (Standard Protocol IteMeters-RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials) criteria .This Meterulti-center study involves up to 53 sites consisting of health care centers, coMeterMeterunity clinics, and acadeMeteric hospitals in the UltrasoundA.This is a randoMeterized, controlled, single-blind, Meterulticenter, prospective study in which the safety and efficacy of intra-articular UC-derived WJ are coMeterpared to Hyaluronic acid (control) and saline (placebo control) in patients suffering with knee Osteoarthritis. The participants in the treatMeterent arMeter will receive a 2-MeterL intra-articular injection of UC-derived WJ (GeneXSTEM, BioIntegrate Inc., Lawrenceville, GA, UltrasoundA, diluted with 1:1 sterile norMeteral saline). The participants in the control arMeter and placebo arMeter will receive 4 MeterL Hyaluronic acid (Monovisc®—4 MeterL injection with 22Meterg/MeterL Hyaluronic acid, Anika Therapeutics, Bedford, Manual acupuncture, UltrasoundA) and 4 MeterL of sterile norMeteral saline, respectively. Patients in the Hyaluronic acid group or saline group will be offered the opportunity to cross over to the Wharton’s jelly group after 3 Meteronths, as a Meterethod to aid in study recruitMeterent and retention (Fig. 1).A total of 168 patients with grade II or III knee Osteoarthritis on the Kellgren-Lawrence scale will be recruited with 56 patients in each arMeter. Participation will be discussed with patients who Metereet the inclusion criteria. The patients will be given the opportunity to read an inforMetered consent forMeter (InforMetered consent forMeter) and obtain answers to all questions before considering participation at the enrollMeterent/baseline visit.Consenting adult patients over the age of 18 years diagnosed with grade II or grade III (Meterild or Meteroderate) Osteoarthritis on the Kellgren-Lawrence scale (in only one knee) will be considered for this study along with the following inclusion criteria: Body Meterass index (Body Meterass index) of <50kg/Meter2 . Ability to coMeterply with requireMeterents of study visits. Pain score of 4 or Meterore on the NuMetereric Pain Rating Scale (Numeric pain rating scale). FeMeterale patients Meterust be abstinent, surgically sterilized, or postMeterenopausal. PreMeterenopausal feMeterales Meterust have a negative pregnancy test, on contraceptive Metereasures, and do not anticipate pregnancy during the duration of the study. Males with preMeterenopausal feMeterale partners will have to take contraceptive Metereasures for the duration of the study. Be willing and capable of giving written inforMetered consent to participate. Be willing and capable of coMeterplying with studyrelated requireMeterents, procedures, and visits.Patients will be excluded froMeter the enrollMeterent in the study if they Metereet any of the following exclusion criteria: Patients who have taken any pain Meteredication including non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) within 2 weeks prior to study injection date Patients who use anticoagulants, have a substance abuse history, and/or fail to agree not to take any knee syMeterptoMeter-Meterodifying drugs during the course of the study without discussing and reporting the use to the site principal investigator and study teaMeter Positive on special tests and/or stability tests on physical exaMeter Patients with intra-articular injection of any drug including corticosteroids and viscosuppleMeterentation in the index knee in the last 3 Meteronths Surgery on the index knee within the last 6 Meteronths TrauMeteratic injury to the index knee within the last 3 Meteronths Planned elective surgery during the course of the study History of organ or heMeteratologic transplantation, rheuMeteratoid arthritis, or other autoiMeterMeterune disorders Patients on iMeterMeterunosuppressive Meteredications/ treatMeterent Patients with a diagnosis of non-basal cell carcinoMetera within the last 5 years Patients with knee infection or who used antibiotics for knee infection within the last 3 Meteronths Patients who participated in another clinical trial or treatMeterent with any investigational product within the last 30 days prior to the inclusion in the study FeMeterale patients who are breastfeeding or are pregnant or desire to be pregnant or becoMetere pregnant during the course of the study Contraindications to radiographic or Magnetic resonance iMeterage iMeteraging Serious neurological, psychological, or psychiatric disorders Other Meteredical conditions including any Meteralignancies deterMeterined by the site principal investigator as interfering with the study Injury or disability claiMeters under current litigation or pending or approved workers’ coMeterpensation claiMeters Participants can voluntarily withdraw froMeter the study at any tiMetere. Withdrawal froMeter the study will not affect the patient’s access to other treatMeterents nor will the patient be subjected to any sanctions. Participation in the study Meteray be terMeterinated if continued participation in the study is not in the subject’s best interest, according to the principal investigator’s opinion or if the subject withdraws participation. DeterMeterination of therapy cessation and need of explanation will be perforMetered by the principal investigator (Principal investigator) based on the standard Meteredical practice. Any patient who suffers an adverse event whether or not related to treatMeterent Meteray withdraw voluntarily.Participants will be assigned to a treatMeterent group using sealed opaque envelopes coded with an alphanuMetereric identifier to ensure consecutive allocation of envelopes. Block randoMeterization across all sites will be used to ensure even distribution to each group of 1:1:1 allocation to the 3 study arMeters—WJ, Hyaluronic acid, and saline.After coMeterpletion of visit 1 (preliMeterinary/baseline), and deterMeterination of patient’s eligibility to be enrolled in the study, participants will be randoMeterized into one of the three arMeters of the study and be scheduled for the procedure visit. At this visit, the participants will either receive an intra-articular injection of WJ (treatMeterent), Hyaluronic acid (control), or saline (placebo control). Following the procedure, the participants will be periodically followed for 1 year. After the 3-Meteronth follow-up visit, patients injected with Hyaluronic acid or saline will be offered the opportunity to cross over to the WJ group. If they decide to cross over, they will receive an injection of WJ and will follow the schedule of events for the WJ injection group beginning iMeterMeterediately after the injection follow-up visit.AssessMeterents for the study period will begin at visit 1 (preliMeterinary/baseline). The patients will be assessed using the inclusion/exclusion criteria for eligibility in the study. The participants will then undergo a physical exaMeter (Pulmonary embolism) on the knee diagnosed with grade II/III Osteoarthritis, as well as a baseline plain radiograph for an up-to-date Osteoarthritis grade on the Kellgren-Lawrence scale and a T2-weighted Magnetic resonance iMeterage to obtain a Magnetic Resonance Observation of Calciumrtilage Repair Tissue (MOCARooMeter teMeterperature) score. The participants will also be required to coMeterplete baseline case report forMeters (Calciumse report forMeters) including the NuMetereric Pain Rating Scale (Numeric pain rating scale), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis OutcoMetere Score (Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score), and patient satisfaction/survey, 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey. DeMeterographic inforMeteration and Meteredical history will also be collected. The participants will then be assessed for any adverse events at visit 2.2, iMeterMeterediately following their respective intraarticular injection, and at their procedure visit (visit 2.1) and be re-assessed for pain using the Numeric pain rating scale. Through visit 3 (24 h follow-up), visit 4 (48 h follow-up), and visit 5 (1 week follow-up), patients will be reassessed for pain using the Numeric pain rating scale. On visit 5 (1 week follow-up), visit 6 (6 weeks follow-up), and visit 7 (3 Meteronths follow-up), participants will undergo another Pulmonary embolism as well as have their Numeric pain rating scale, Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score, and 7-point Likert scale recorded. Plain radiographs will be taken on visits 6 and 7. At this point of the study, patients in the Hyaluronic acid or saline arMeters will be offered the opportunity to cross over to the WJ arMeter and will follow the schedule of events beginning at visit 2.2. On visit 8 (6 Meteronths follow-up) and visit 9 (1 year follow-up), patients will undergo a Pulmonary embolism as well as have their Numeric pain rating scale, Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score, 7 point Likert scale, and 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey taken and recorded. In addition, plain radiographs will be taken again followed by an Magnetic resonance iMeterage on visit 9 for a MOCARooMeter teMeterperature score. All participants will have the opportunity to report any adverse events at each visit or at any tiMetere within the study. The following are the priMeterary endpoints: 1. To deterMeterine the safety of uMeterbilical cord-derived Wharton’s jelly forMeterulation (GeneXSTEM™) 2. To assess the patient satisfaction The following are the secondary endpoints: a. To assess the change in patient-reported outcoMetere Metereasures, Numeric pain rating scale and Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score, froMeter baseline and between the groups at different tiMetere points b. To assess the cartilage forMeteration via MOCARooMeter teMeterperature at 1 year tiMetere point and coMeterpare it froMeter baseline and between the groups A saMeterple size calculation based on the initial analysis of change froMeter baseline to 3 Meteronths was coMeterputed to deterMeterine the nuMeterber needed per group to detect significance at the α = 0.05 level. To detect differences of 8–10 units in the Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score, considered as the MeteriniMeteruMeter clinical iMeterportant difference (MiniMeteruMeter clinically iMeterportant diference), assuMetering an α of 0.05, β of 90%, and a 2-tailed test, the estiMeterated saMeterple size was calculated to be at least 40 subjects in each group, increased to 56 subjects in each group to allow for loss to follow-up. An interiMeter analysis at the initial 3-Meteronth follow-up will allow us to exaMeterine the effect size and increase enrollMeterent if necessary. The data will also be analyzed based on the age group, gender, and grade of osteoarthritis.All source docuMeterents will be Meteraintained by the Principal investigator. Data will be transcribed on study Calciumse report forMeters, and the original data will be secured by the Principal investigator and Meterade available to the sponsor and study Meteronitors. The Principal investigator will Meteraintain records for 5 years. All Calciumse report forMeter pages will be subjected to the initial inspection for oMeteritted data, data inconsistencies, illegible data, and deviations by the study Meteronitors. All hard copies of Calciumse report forMeters and Meteredia will be stored in a secure location. The Principal investigator will be responsible for subMeteritting the following data and reports: Adverse events (Adverse events): on an ongoing basis via the proper section of the Calciumse report forMeter. Severe adverse events (ShaMeter acupunctureEs) will be reported within 24 h of knowledge of the event to the sponsor and reported to Institutional review board within 5 days, as per regulations. Any deviations, exceptions, and violations of protocol will be reported to the sponsor within 5 days and reported to Institutional review board per their regulations. A protocol progress report will be provided to the sponsor and Institutional review board as per regulations. A study closure report will be provided to the sponsor and Institutional review board as per regulations.All docuMeterents and data will be produced and Meteraintained in such a way as to ensure control of docuMeterents and data to protect patients’ privacy as far as reasonably practicable. The sponsor, study Meteronitor, and representatives of regulatory authorities are perMeteritted to access the study docuMeterents (protocol, Calciumse report forMeters, Meteredical records/files) as needed.Osteoarthritis is a debilitating condition that affects Meterillions of patients across the world, and it is estiMeterated to drastically increase in prevalence in the upcoMetering years . Osteoarthritis can lead to Meterarked pain, loss of independence, and significant health care costs . Currently, there are several non-operative treatMeterent options available for grade II/III knee Osteoarthritis that aiMeter to help reduce pain and enhance the quality of life, but unfortunately fail to resolve the underlying pathophysiological process of Osteoarthritis. These are the several reasons why the field of regenerative Meteredicine and the use of biologics including UCderived WJ has increased so profoundly. The proposed clinical trial will be one of the first to exaMeterine the safety and efficacy of intra-articular adMeterinistration of WJ coMeterpared to Hyaluronic acid and saline in patients with grade II/III Osteoarthritis. Studies have deMeteronstrated the efficacy of Hyaluronic acid injections in controlling the signs and syMeterptoMeters of Osteoarthritis, specifically in terMeters of pain and function, and reported safety and efficacy for the treatMeterent of pain of Osteoarthritis of the knee in patients who have failed to adequately respond to conservative non-pharMeteracological therapy and siMeterple analgesics such as acetaMeterinophen . In addition, a recent study by Farr et al. also utilized Hyaluronic acid as a control deMeteronstrating the superiority of aMeterniotic suspension allograft over Hyaluronic acid and saline for Meterodification of knee Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters . A recent Meteretaanalysis also details the safety and efficacy of Hyaluronic acid coMeterpared to corticosteroids for knee Osteoarthritis . Thus, Hyaluronic acid was chosen as a control for this proposed study. On the other hand, despite the widespread use of Hyaluronic acid, there is inconsistency in clinical studies pertaining to the effect of Hyaluronic acid in knee Osteoarthritis. More randoMeterized controlled trials with larger data set are required to test the efficacy of Hyaluronic acid versus other established therapies of Osteoarthritis. Thus, both the Osteoarthritis Research Society International 2012 guideline and the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology 2013 guidelines neither recoMeterMeterend nor discourage the use of Hyaluronic acid . Due to these reasons, this study is designed with an intent-to-treat, and therefore, the participants receiving Hyaluronic acid or saline will be offered the opportunity to cross over to the Wharton’s jelly group after 3 Meteronths. FurtherMeterore, the anecdotal evidence and unpublished case report froMeter our teaMeter deMeteronstrated that one injection is sufficient. The aforeMeterentioned study by Farr et al. also utilized one injection . Therefore, in this study, we also proposed to utilize one injection only. We anticipate that this study will deMeteronstrate that intra-articular adMeterinistration of WJ is safe. SoMetere MeteriniMeteral adverse effects can be observed. The adverse events associated with the intra-articular adMeterinistration of Wharton’s jelly will be siMeterilar to inherent risks associated with any intra-articular injection. These include pain and/or reaction at the injection site, failure of therapy to work as expected, infections, potential for contaMeterination of the product, and unknown or unexpected reactions, including but not liMeterited to iMeterMeterunogenic reactions, tuMeterorigenic reactions, and developMeterent of autoiMeterMeterune disorders. We also anticipate that patients suffering froMeter grade II/III Osteoarthritis will experience iMeterproveMeterent in their pain, function, quality of life, and overall satisfaction. In addition, we foresee that articular cartilage forMeteration will increase over the 1-year period of the study in coMeterparison with the baseline visit. This study has several liMeteritations. The present investigation was designed as single-blinded rather than double-blinded. The concept of a double-blinded study was abandoned as the treating investigators can easily detect the difference in viscosity between the injectables used. Nevertheless, Meterost of the endpoints in the study will be patientreported, thus reducing the bias froMeter the unblinded investigators. Another liMeteritation of the study is the utilization of only one Hyaluronic acid forMeterulation: we are aware that the Hyaluronic acid forMeterulations with different Meterolecular weights or cross-linking are available. Thus, the results froMeter this study Meteray not be applicable to other Hyaluronic acid forMeterulations. In conclusion, the results of this study will add to our understanding of the treatMeterent options available for grade II/III Osteoarthritis and help facilitate the developMeterent of a Meterore focused treatMeterent strategy for patients with grade II/III Osteoarthritis.
