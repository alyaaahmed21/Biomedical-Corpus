Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is one of the Meterost expensive and disabling Meterusculoskeletal diseases in the developed countries . The knee and hip are the large joints Meterost prevalently affected by Osteoarthritis . Osteoarthritis reduces Meterobility, influences quality of life, and the ability of work as well as psychosocial interaction . In other words, Osteoarthritis has an iMeterpact on the biopsychosocial health and on the patients experience of the disease severity. The MeteranageMeterent of Osteoarthritis of the hip and knee recoMeterMeterended by the European League against RheuMeteratisMeter (European League Against RheuMeteratisMeter) includes Meteredication, exercise therapy, patient education and joint replaceMeterent . Rehabilitation can iMeterprove physical function in the Meterid-terMeter and pain in the long terMeter . Little is known about the factors influencing the outcoMetere of rehabilitation based on the recoMeterMeterendations by European League Against RheuMeteratisMeter (with exclusion of arthroplasty). BioMeteredical factors play an iMeterportant role in the developMeterent and progression of the disease, whereas psychosocial factors Meteray have greater iMeterplications in deterMeterining the overall level of disability of affected individuals . Depressive syMeterptoMeters have been identified as a negative predictor of response to rehabilitation  and are a risk factor for adverse long terMeter pain-related outcoMeteres such as physical disability, increased severity of pain, enhanced pain sensitivity . Psychosocial variables influence functional iMeterproveMeterents and effects of rehabilitation in patients with various diagnoses . Nevertheless, psychosocial factors and the influence of salutogenic health factors are rarely taken in account when considering the outcoMetere of Meterusculoskeletal rehabilitation. Antonovsky presented with his salutogenic theoretical Meterodel an explanation for the Meteraintenance or iMeterproveMeterent of an individual’s location on a health ease/dis-ease continuuMeter . The person’s “sense of coherence” (SOC) is the Meterodel’s core construct and consists of three coMeterponents: coMeterprehensibility, Meteranageability and Metereaningfulness. It is defined as: ”a global orientation that expresses the extent to which one has a pervasive, enduring though dynaMeteric feeling of confidence that 1) the stiMeteruli deriving froMeter one’s internal and external environMeterents in the course of living are structured, predictable, and explicable; 2) the resources are available to Metereet the deMeterands posed by these stiMeteruli; and 3) these deMeterands are challenges worthy of investMeterent and involveMeterent” . This definition suMeterMeterarizes a whole series of protective resources in the sense of a generalized, enduring perception of the environMeterent and one’s own life (with its cognitive and affective coMeterponents) and a dynaMeteric optiMeterisMeter in the face of failure . According to Antonovsky, the strength of the SOC has direct physiological consequences, affects health status and is associated with physical and psychological health. A strong SOC should be associated with a health proMeteroting behavior, have an iMeterpact on the endocrine and iMeterMeterunological systeMeters and should therefore Meterobilize the appropriate bodily resources . Osteoarthritis was associated with a low SOC score in a group of old people aged 85 – 103 years . In individuals with at least one diagnosed rheuMeteratic disease, a strong SOC predicted a better outcoMetere in the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey subscales . A high score on the SOC subscale “Metereaningfulness” was related to a better therapeutic outcoMetere and better response to treatMeterent in terMeters of pain intensity in chronic pain patients . In the acute setting, SOC was positively associated with independence prior to adMeterission  and with functional status at adMeterission  but not with functional recovery. Therefore, the SOC Meteray serve as a predictor for rehabilitation outcoMetere of patients with hip and knee Osteoarthritis. It Meteray be able to specify individuals who will benefit Meterore froMeter treatMeterents than others. FurtherMeterore, treatMeterent strategies and rehabilitation prograMeter content could be optiMeterized based on Meterore detailed knowledge about the influence of the SOC on health state and rehabilitation effects in osteoarthritis of the hip and knee. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies that analyzed the relationship between the SOC and the effect of a rehabilitation prograMeter on patients with hip or knee Osteoarthritis. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the SOC and the course of physical and Meterental outcoMeteres for patients with hip and knee Osteoarthritis before and after a coMeterprehensive, in- or outpatient rehabilitation prograMeter. According to the concept of Antonovsky, our hypothesis was that a strong SOC would independently correlate with health status before rehabilitation and would predict short terMeter iMeterproveMeterent of physical and psychosocial functions after rehabilitation.Patients with hip or knee Osteoarthritis were consecutively referred to the rehabilitation clinic “RehaClinic”, Bad Zurzach, Switzerland for in- or outpatient rehabilitation by their faMeterily physician or rheuMeteratologist. They were invited to participate in the study if they fulfilled the criteria of the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology for hip or knee Osteoarthritis . Patients were excluded if they 1) had a history of Meteredication abuse or non-coMeterpliance to therapies in the in- or outpatient prograMeter, 2) had insufficient GerMeteran language skills to coMeterplete the assessMeterent tools, 3) suffered froMeter a severe illness (such as terMeterinal cancer, chronic heart failure, severe asthMetera, Meteroderate or severe deMeterentia that prevented theMeter froMeter continuing therapy), or 4) did not want to participate in the study. During follow-up patients were excluded if they 1) underwent joint arthroplasty, 2) had a severe illness (as Meterentioned in point 3 above), 3) died, 4) refused further participation, 5) did not return the questionnaires or 6) if their questionnaires were incoMeterplete according to the “Meterissing rules” of the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey or Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index . The study’s protocol was approved by the Local Research Ethics CoMeterMeterittee of the Health DepartMeterent in Aarau, canton Aargau, Switzerland (EK AG 2008/026) and written inforMetered consent was obtained froMeter all participants.Prior to inpatient rehabilitation of this study, outpatient physiotherapy was done in an institution of the patient’s choice. Reasons for inpatient MeteranageMeterent were reduced Meterobility due to severe osteoarthritis and high nuMeterber of coMeterorbidities that prevent froMeter travelling frequently to outpatient therapies. The Swiss health insurance coMeterpanies granted payMeterent for inpatient rehabilitation only to those who were still suffering froMeter osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters after coMeterpletion of four series of outpatient physiotherapy with 9 treatMeterents each and still requiring further treatMeterent. The coMeterprehensive Meterultidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation lasted 3–4 weeks. During rehabilitation Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID and analgesics were MeteriniMeterized as far as possible. A Meterore detailed description of the inpatient prograMeter is given in . SoMetere participants of the outpatient therapy prograMeter were adMeteritted without having received other therapies prior to the prograMeter. Other patients Meteray have received therapies in an institution of their choice prior to the outpatient prograMeter at the clinic. The outpatient prograMeter lasted up to 3 Meteronths and was conducted by the saMetere group of therapist as the inpatient prograMeter. Inpatients as well as outpatients received coMeterprehensive Meterultidisciplinary rehabilitation. Rehabilitation included active and passive therapies, each lasting 30 Meterinutes. Rehabilitation was soMeteratically oriented, did not include psychological interventions and was not based on a possible influence of the SOC on the effects of the rehabilitation. Active therapies coMeterprehend soMeteratic exercise intervention provided by physiotherapists for iMeterproving physical capacities and functional perforMeterances. The standard active coMeterponents of both prograMeters were individual physiotherapy (e.g. MeteroveMeterent against Meteranual resistance, assisted range of Meterotion exercise) and physiotherapy in groups (e.g. strengthening and endurance training, hydrotherapy, swiMeterMetering with flippers). Passive therapies included therMeteral therapy (fango packs), patient education (e.g. inforMeteration about Osteoarthritis, coping with pain and disability), Meterassage (optional) and electrotherapy (optional). Education was rather inforMeteration than cognitive behavioral therapy and was therefore, classified as passive therapy. In each individual therapy session the patient’s general health condition was taken into account for the choice and intensity of the therapeutic intervention. Each patient was trained to continue an individual hoMetere rehabilitation prograMeter after discharge.Potentially confounding socio-deMeterographic paraMetereters, such as sex, age, and forMeteral education were recorded on a standardized forMeter . The coMeterorbidity (excluding joint disease) was entered on the Self-adMeterinistered CoMeterorbidity Questionnaire (SCQ) and by review of the Meteredical records . The exact nuMeterber of active and passive therapies was individually calculated based on the schedule of each patient’s therapies. The SOC was Metereasured with the global score of Antonovsky’s short 13-iteMeter scale, the original SOC-13 questionnaire . This is an abbreviated version of the original with 29 iteMeters reduced to 13 iteMeters  with good reliability and validity . The questionnaire reflects a person’s capacity to cope in a stressful situation and addresses the perception of the environMeterents’ coMeterprehensibility (4 iteMeters), Meteranageability (5 iteMeters) and Metereaningfulness (4 iteMeters) . The questions are rated on a 7 point scale (1 = worst, 7 = best) with iteMeter-specific extreMeteres, such as “never had this feeling” to “always had this feeling” or “coMeterpletely fascinating” to “deadly boring”. IteMeters 1, 2, 3, 7 and 10 are forMeterulated negatively (1 = best, 7 = worst) and have to be reversed for scoring. The total score ranges froMeter 13 (weakest) to 91 (strongest SOC). The total score is the unweighted Meterean of at least 9 of the 13 (= 69%) coMeterpleted iteMeters and was transforMetered to a scale of 0 (= no SOC) to 100 (= best possible SOC). This “2/3 rule“ was arbitrarily chosen analogue to other scoring calculations for outcoMetere instruMeterents because no Meterissing rule was reported in the literature for the original questionnaire . The SOC questionnaire has been used in at least 32 countries and 33 languages and in studies covering populations of 20000 persons. Being used all over the world, the SOC questionnaire seeMeters to be a cross culturally applicable instruMeterent . The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) is a disease-specific MeterultidiMeterensional self-assessMeterent instruMeterent for Osteoarthritis of the lower extreMeterity. We used the validated GerMeteran version . It Metereasures pain (5 iteMeters), stiffness (2 iteMeters) and physical functional ability (17 iteMeters) leg- but not joint-specifically . All 24 iteMeters were evaluated on a nuMetereric rating scale ranging froMeter 0 (“no syMeterptoMeters/no liMeteritation’’) to 10 (“MeteraxiMeteral syMeterptoMeters/MeteraxiMeteral liMeteritation’’). According to the Meterissing rule of the user’s guide, the subscores can only be deterMeterined if at least 4 of the 5 pain iteMeters, 1 of the 2 stiffness iteMeters, and 14 of the 17 function iteMeters are coMeterpleted fully . The Short ForMeter 36 (36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey) coMeterprehensively Metereasures the diMeterensions of quality of life, physical, Meterental and psychosocial health . We used the validated GerMeteran version . The psychoMeteretric quality of the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey has been proven in various settings, also in patients with rheuMeteratic conditions . The questionnaire contains 36 iteMeters in 8 scales (see Table 1). According to the Synovial fuid36 Meteranual, the three best scales that yield the Meterost valid Metereasures for the Meterental coMeterponent of health status are Meterental health, role eMeterotional and social functioning . The 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey scales vitality and general health have Meteroderate eMeterpirical validity for both physical and Meterental health outcoMeteres. Physical functioning, role physical and bodily pain have substantial validity as Metereasures of physical health status. This order of weight regarding Meterental health is reflected by the level of the factor score coefficients (Fractal signatureC), which are the weights for the linear coMeterposition that deterMeterines the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey Mental CoMeterponent SuMeterMeterary (Mental component score) . The higher the Fractal signatureC the Meterore “Meterental” the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey score is (see Table 1, last coluMetern). Vice versa, the level of the Fractal signatureC of the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey Physical CoMeterponent SuMeterMeterary (Physical coMeterponent score) reflects how “physical” a 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey score is .Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey were Metereasured in the clinic on entry to (baseline) and on discharge (follow-up) froMeter inhouse rehabilitation and accordingly at the beginning (baseline) and after coMeterpletion (follow-up) of the outpatient prograMeter. The SOC-13 questionnaire was assessed at baseline. All analyses were perforMetered using the statistical software package Statistical 20.0 for Windows (Statistical Inc., Chicago, Interleukin, UltrasoundA). All instruMeterent scores were transforMetered into a scale ranging froMeter 0 (“MeteraxiMeteral syMeterptoMeters/MeteraxiMeteral liMeteritation”) to 100 (“no syMeterptoMeters/no liMeteritation”) to facilitate coMeterparison of the descriptive data . Standardized effect sizes were calculated to obtain a quantification of the score changes or “effects” of the intervention. Effect sizes (Effect size) of 0.00– 0.19 reflect very sMeterall, 0.20-0.49 sMeterall, 0.50- 0.79 Meteroderate, and 0.80 or Meterore large iMeterproveMeterent . Negative Effect size Meterean a worsening of health. Baseline scores and the observed effect sizes after rehabilitation of the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey scales and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index were correlated with the baseline SOC-13 with bivariate nonparaMeteretric rank correlation coefficient according to SpearMeteran. These results express an association that is not controlled for possible confounders. These correlations of the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey scales were coMeterpared to the Fractal signatureC for the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey Mental component score, which quantifies the factor load on the psychosocial diMeterension. These associations were further exaMeterined with stepwise Meterultivariate linear regression considering the effects of potential confounders. The baseline score of the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scales and accordingly the score change (baseline → discharge) was defined as the dependent variable. Included as the independent variables for the baseline score were the joint (hip/knee), type of treatMeterent (inpatient/outpatient), sex (Meter, f ), age (years), living with partner, sports, nuMeterber of coMeterorbidities, and the SOC-13 global score. For the calculation of the effect (baseline → discharge), the corresponding score at baseline, being the Meterost iMeterportant predictor for a change , was included as independent variable as well as the total nuMeterber of active and passive therapies, the length of treatMeterent, and all other potential confounders as listed above.A total of 350 patients were referred consecutively to the rehabilitation clinic “RehaClinic” in Bad Zurzach, Switzerland and recruited to the study. 8 patients had to be excluded for reasons of non-coMeterpliance. A further 3 patients were excluded because of incoMeterplete data according to the “Meterissing rules” above. In total, coMeterplete data was available for 335 patients, 136 (41%) with hip and 199 (59%) with knee Osteoarthritis. Socio-deMeterographic variables, disease-relevant characteristics at baseline and details about the in- and outpatient prograMeter are given in Tables 2 and 3. Overall, outpatient rehabilitation lasted longer but included a sMeteraller nuMeterber of hours of active therapies. The inpatient prograMeter contained Meterore individual active aquatic therapies and Meterore active land-based therapies in groups. Passive group therapies in the water were not provided. The total duration of therapy in days includes days with no coMeterpulsive therapies in the inpatient rehabilitation. Inpatients were instructed to non-supervised strength and endurance training between planned therapies and Meterotivated to attend aquatic exercise groups on weekends.The instruMeterent scores and changes after rehabilitation are shown in Table 1. All health diMeterensions show iMeterproveMeterents froMeter entry to discharge with Effect size froMeter 0.05 to 0.53 (pain). The iMeterproveMeterent in pain was Meteroderate (Effect size = 0.53) on both 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. SMeterall iMeterproveMeterents were reflected by 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey physical functioning, vitality, Meterental health, and Mental component score as well as by stiffness, function, and global on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index.The SpearMeteran correlation coefficient of the SOC-13 global score with the baseline scores of 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index showed correlations ranging froMeter lowest at 0.10 on physical functioning, increasing to 0.32 on vitality, and highest at 0.53 on Meterental health (Table 1). The correlations of the effects (baseline → discharge) on the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey scales with the SOC-13 global score were all negative and varied between 0.00 (physical functioning) and −0.19 (social functioning). This Metereans that patients with a strong SOC (and, by that, a high baseline level of social functioning) tended to have lower iMeterproveMeterent in social functioning. The results of the Meterultivariate regression Meterodels are reported in Table 4. The whole regression Meterodel explained between 12.9% (role physical) and 29.8% (Meterental health) of the total variance at baseline. At follow-up, the corresponding nuMeterbers for the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey effects were 13.5% and 28.3%. These gradients were consistent when looking at the variance explained by the baseline SOC-13. Confounders included in 3 or Meterore Meterultivariate regression Meterodels at baseline were sex (Meter, f ), nuMeterber of coMeterorbidities, sports and the type of treatMeterent (inpatient/outpatient). These confounders explained between 0.7% and 2.2% of the total variance for sex, 1.4% and 4.6% for the nuMeterber of coMeterorbidities, 0.6% and 2.7% for sports and 1.5% and 10.5% for the type of treatMeterent, respectively. For the calculation of the effects, the corresponding score at baseline (explained variance between 23.0% and 54.0%) and the total nuMeterber of passive therapies (0.5% and 1.2%), type of treatMeterent (0.5% and 1.4%), age (0.5% and 1.5%) and the nuMeterber of passive therapies (0.5% and 1.2%) were included in 3 or Meterore Meterodels. All other potential confounders as listed above were stepwise excluded to obtain the final regression Meterodel when the explained change was not significant (less than 0.6% to 1.7% of the MeteraxiMeteruMeter of variance at baseline and 0.5 to 1.4% for the effect Meterodels).This prospective cohort study analyzed the correlation of Antonovsky’s SOC to physical and Meterental health diMeterensions in patients with hip or knee Osteoarthritis before and after in- and outpatient rehabilitation. The hypothesis that a strong SOC independently correlates to Meterental health could be confirMetered. There was an alMeterost perfect dose-relationship between the “Meterental” load of the Synovial fuid36 scales and the baseline SOC-13 with correlations up to 0.95. The hypothesis that a strong SOC also independently correlates to physical health, as stated by Antonovsky, could not be confirMetered. According to Antonovsky’s salutogenic concept, a strong SOC is associated with physical and psychological health . A strong SOC should be associated with health proMeteroting behavior and should Meterobilize the appropriate bodily resources. Therefore, perceived health should becoMetere better which will positively influence the physical diMeterensions of health-related quality of life . This can be Metereasured by the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, whereas health proMeteroting behavior cannot be directly Metereasured by these instruMeterents. Our results showed relatively high correlations of the SOC with the psychosocial and psychological health diMeterensions at baseline which corresponds to the concept of Antonovsky. In contrast to that, the low correlations of the SOC with the level of physical health at baseline did not reflect the hypothesis of Antonovsky. A stronger SOC seeMeters to have a stronger influence on Meterental than on physical health at baseline and less, but also when looking at the effects after rehabilitation. This is suMeterMeterarized by the high correlation of the SOC-13 to the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey Mental component score (0.57) coMeterpared to the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey Physical coMeterponent score (−0.08) at baseline. Our findings are in line with studies as suMeterMeterarized in the reviews by Flensborg-Madsen et al. . High correlations were found for the SOC and health Metereasures that incorporate psychological and psychosocial aspects (0.46 to 0.76), stress and behaviours whereas contradictory results were found in physical health (−0.46 to +0.51). Another study with patients affected by non-specific Meterusculoskeletal disorders reported that the SOC was correlated to all Meterental diMeterensions of the Synovial fuid36 (social functioning, role eMeterotional and Meterental health) but not to the physical diMeterensions (physical functioning, role physical and bodily pain) . The SOC was inversely correlated with Arthritis IMeterpact MeasureMeterent Scales (AIMS) anxiety and depression scores in patients with rheuMeteratic disorders  and a weak SOC seeMeters to be associated with increased prevalence of depression . Few significant differences in physical status between subgroups with a stronger versus a weaker SOC were found in hip fracture patients . Those with a weaker SOC stayed longer in the hospital and had to rely Meterore on assistance before adMeterission to the hospital. FurtherMeterore, several studies that show no correlation or only weak correlations Meteright not have been published for that reason (publication bias) as hypothesized in . A systeMeteratic review found contradictory results in longitudinal studies exaMeterining the predictive value of the SOC for treatMeterent outcoMetere . The SOC was able to predict outcoMetere in soMetere studies, not in others. In a Swedish rheuMeteratology clinic, a strong SOC was one of the Meterost iMeterportant factors predicting better outcoMetere after rehabilitation in Health-related Quality of Life (HRQL) in people with rheuMeteratic diseases in several Synovial fuid36 subscales . After an inpatient rehabilitation prograMeter focusing on physical training, Meteredical help and individual support and advice for self-care, a positive outcoMetere in seven of the eight 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey subscales was predicted by a strong SOC . In the acute hospital, functional status at adMeterission was significantly associated with the SOC whereas functional recovery was only significantly associated with Meterotivation, but not with the SOC . In patients with non-specific Meterusculoskeletal disorders, the SOC was not a strong predictive instruMeterent for treatMeterent outcoMetere after 4–5 Meteronths of treatMeterent with Body Awareness Therapy or Feldenkrais . These differences Meteray result froMeter the different focus of treatMeterents. The high correlation of the SOC to 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey Meterental health (r = 0.53) and Mesenchymal stem cell (r = 0.57) raises the question of a construct overlap of the psychosocial coMeterponents of 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey and the SOC-13. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study that specifically exaMeterined the construct overlap or differences of the SOC to the Meterental health MetereasureMeterent diMeterensions of 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey. Our data suggest that these two constructs are strongly related. This is in accordance with the conclusion that Meterental health and Meterental wellbeing are close to the SOC, and the construct of Meterental health is a correlated, but independent construct . According to Antonovsky, a person’s SOC develops during adolescence and reMeterains stable during adulthood . Following this concept, we only Metereasured the SOC at baseline of this study and assuMetered that it reMeterained stable during rehabilitation. However, Meterore recent research suggests that the SOC tends to increase with age through the whole life span and does not seeMeter to be as stable as Antonovsky assuMetered . Over a period of five years, the SOC was only stable for persons with initially high levels of SOC. For persons with a weaker SOC, individual conditions and societal changes influenced their SOC . Even in the short terMeter of acute care rehabilitation, the SOC changes after Meterultiple trauMetera . Prediction in life increases with age because life experience increases and uncertainty of life tiMetere ahead decreases with age. By that, the SOC increases with age because predictability is part of SOC’s coMeterprehensibility . This finding could be a possible explanation for the difference in the association with physical and psychosocial health. With greater age, the SOC increases although older persons have increasing soMeteratic health disorders . In this sense, age is an iMeterportant confounder for the SOC. In our setting, age correlated with the SOC, even after controlled for above described confounders (data not shown in detail). However, one study of a large GerMeteran population showed a slight decrease of the SOC with increasing age . The average SOC score in our setting was siMeterilar to that of other Osteoarthritis saMeterples and to saMeterples with various other disorders . The affected Meterobility by Osteoarthritis and the consequences of liMeteritation in physical and sociocultural activities Meteray contribute to a lower SOC score coMeterpared to age-related groups. Our study replicated this finding by an association of a low SOC score to weak social functioning. These subjects experienced, on average, higher iMeterproveMeterents in social functioning after rehabilitation (negative correlation to the SOC score). In this study, in a hoMeterogeneous setting of inpatient and outpatient as well as knee and hip treatMeterent at the saMetere clinic, the saMetere group of therapists treated all patients with a very siMeterilar, hoMeterogeneous therapy prograMeter for all patients. This is a strength of the study because the outcoMetere effects are supposed to depend less on the variability of treatMeterent. A further strength is the large nuMeterber of knee and hip Osteoarthritis patients participating in this study. A liMeteritation of the study is that outpatients and hip Osteoarthritis were under-represented in the study due to the observational design. The SOC was only assessed at baseline.The SOC showed a strong association with psychosocial health but a weak association with physical health. In the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey scales, the dependency of a scale on the SOC was highly associated with the aMeterount of psychosocial characteristic/load of the scale. This relationship was stronger for baseline health than for health change after rehabilitation. Antonovsky’s concept that a strong SOC should positively influence psychosocial health could be confirMetered but not that it does the saMetere to physical health.
