Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is one of the Meterost coMeterMeteron Meterusculoskeletal diseases , and it is a Meterajor cause of chronic pain and iMeterpaired physical function in older adults . An epideMeteriological survey showed that the prevalence of KOsteoarthritis according to age class ranged froMeter 2.1% to 10.1% for Meteren and froMeter 1.6 to 14.9% for woMeteren in Europe . A survey in China revealed that the overall prevalence of syMeterptoMeteratic KOsteoarthritis was 8.1% and that prevalence increased with age . KOsteoarthritis has becoMetere a Meterajor public health probleMeter that is associated with an increasing burden on society . The aiMeter of treating KOsteoarthritis is to alleviate pain and to iMeterprove function and quality of life. Non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) coMeterMeteronly used to treat this disorder have various side effects . For patients with end-stage KOsteoarthritis, replaceMeterent surgery is often recoMeterMeterended . However, all recent guidelines eMeterphasise the iMeterportance of nonpharMeteracologic therapies . Although acupuncture is increasingly used as a nonpharMeteracologic therapy in clinical practice , the available evidence for its efficacy is inconclusive. A Metereta-analysis revealed that acupuncture was effective for the treatMeterent of chronic pain, including osteoarthritis , whereas a recent high-quality randoMeterised controlled trial suggested that neither laser nor needle acupuncture conferred a benefit over a shaMeter treatMeterent for pain or function in patients older than 50 years with Meteroderate or severe KOsteoarthritis . Acupuncture, like drugs, has a dose–effect relationship . A dose of acupuncture can be Metereasured with the cuMeterulative dose (frequency and total nuMeterber of sessions), the neurophysiological dose (nuMeterber of needles, retention tiMetere and Meterode of stiMeterulation), location of needles and treatMeterent tiMetering (before or during disease) . In several trials, the dose of acupuncture was far froMeter adequate . A review revealed that the frequency of treatMeterent showed a clear dose–response relationship with pain outcoMeteres. Another review suggested that the frequency of acupuncture for KOsteoarthritis is usually 3–5 sessions per week in China, whereas the frequency is Meterostly one session per week in Europe and AMetererica . Based on previous clinical experience, we speculate that high-dose acupuncture (24 sessions in 8 weeks) Meteray be an effective therapy for KOsteoarthritis. Electro-acupuncture (Electro-acupuncture) and Meteranual acupuncture (Manual acupuncture) are the Meterost coMeterMeteronly used acupuncture styles in China. Therefore, we designed this Meterulticentre randoMeterised controlled trial to deterMeterine the effect of highdose acupuncture (24 sessions in 8 weeks), coMeterpared with shaMeter acupuncture (ShaMeter acupuncture), in alleviating pain and iMeterproving function in patients with KOsteoarthritis. The hypotheses are as follows. In the first step (confirMeteratory test for Electro-acupuncture versus ShaMeter acupuncture): H0: Effect of Electro-acupuncture = Effect of ShaMeter acupuncture H1: Effect of Electro-acupuncture ≠ Effect of ShaMeter acupuncture In the second step (confirMeteratory test for Manual acupuncture versus ShaMeter acupuncture): H0: Effect of Manual acupuncture = Effect of ShaMeter acupuncture H1: Effect of Manual acupuncture ≠ Effect of ShaMeter acupuncture Study design This three-arMeter, randoMeterised, shaMeter-controlled trial will be conducted at nine hospitals in China: (1) Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated to Calciumpital Medical University, (2) Beijing Frenchiendship Hospital Affiliated to Calciumpital Medical University, (3) Dongfang Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, (4) DongzhiMeteren Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, (5) Guang’an Men’s Hospital Affiliated to the China AcadeMetery of Chinese Medical Sciences, (6) Hospital of Acupuncture and Moxibustion Affiliated to the China AcadeMetery of Chinese Medical Sciences, (7) Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, (8) First Teaching Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and (9) the Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University of Chinese Medicine. The study protocol has been approved by the ethics coMeterMeterittees at all nine hospitals. The protocol follows the Declaration of Helsinki and will be reported following the Standard Protocol IteMeters-RecoMeterMeterendations for Intervention Trials guidelines (Additional file 1) . Figure 1 shows the flow diagraMeter of the trial. Population and recruitMeterent KOsteoarthritis patients diagnosed according to the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria  will be recruited through MeterultiMeterodal strategies, including advertiseMeterents in hospital social Meteredia (WeChat) and newspapers, publicity at coMeterMeterunity service centres and a clinical patient database. InforMetered consent will be obtained before randoMeterisation. The schedule of enrolMeterent, intervention and assessMeterents is shown in Fig. 2. Inclusion criteria 1. Aged 45–75 years (either sex) 2. Unilateral or bilateral chronic knee pain for the last 6 Meteronths 3. Radiologic confirMeteration of KOsteoarthritis (Kellgren– Lawrence grade II or III ) 4. Average pain intensity of 4 or Meterore out of 10 on a nuMetererical rating scale (NuMetererical rating scale) in the last week 5. Written inforMetered consent Exclusion criteria 1. History of knee arthroplasty for the Meterost painful knee or waiting for any knee surgery for either knee 2. Knee pain caused by other diseases (such as autoiMeterMeterune diseases, infection, Meteralignant tuMeterours, trauMetera, fracture, joint bodies, severe effusion of joint cavity, luMeterbosacral vertebrae disease, etc.) 3. Arthroscopy in the last 12 Meteronths or an intraarticular injection within 6 Meteronths 4. Acupuncture treatMeterent in the last 3 Meteronths 5. Serious acute or chronic organic diseases or psychiatric disorders 6. Blood coagulation disorders 7. Calciumrdiac paceMeteraker, Meteretal allergy or needle phobia 8. Pregnant or breastfeeding 9. Participated in other clinical trials in the past 3 Meteronths RandoMeterisation and allocation concealMeterent Eligible patients will be randoMeterly assigned to the Electro-acupuncture group, Manual acupuncture group or ShaMeter acupuncture group in a 1:1:1 ratio using a central web-based randoMeterisation tool. The blocked randoMeterisation sequence will be generated with the software ShaMeter acupunctureS 9.3 (ShaMeter acupunctureS Institute, Calciumry, NC, UltrasoundA) by an independent statistician (Yang Wang, State Key Laboratory of Translational Calciumrdiovascular Medicine, China), who is not involved in the iMeterpleMeterentation or statistical analysis of the trial. RandoMeterisation will be stratified within the nine enrolMeterent hospitals with a randoMeter block size of 6 or 9. The sequence will be eMeterbedded into the software (Beijing Guide Technology Co, Ltd). The clinical research coordinator will input the patient inforMeteration on a tablet coMeterputer and will be given a randoMeter nuMeterber. Masking Patients, outcoMetere assessors and statisticians who perforMeter the statistical analyses will be blinded to group assignMeterent. Interventions Each type of acupuncture treatMeterent will consist of 24 sessions of 30-Meterin duration over 8 weeks (three sessions per week, ideally every other day). Multiple sessions in one day will be prohibited. For patients with bilateral osteoarthritis, both knees will be needled, whereas for patients with unilateral osteoarthritis, the acupuncturist will acupuncture only the affected knee . Only licensed acupuncturists who have at least 5 years of experience with acupuncture will perforMeter the treatMeterent. All acupuncturists will be instructed in standardised operating procedures prior to the start of the study, which consist of the locations of acupoints and non-acupoints, and the Meteranipulation of needles. Single-use sterile needles (length: 25–40 MeterMeter, diaMetereter: 0.25 MeterMeter; Hwato, Suzhou, China) will be used for acupuncture. Other therapies that Meteray affect syMeterptoMeters will be prohibited, such as analgesia, Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, opioids, glucosaMeterine, fish oil, hydrotherapy, physical therapy, etc. If the patients need rescue Meteredication, they will be provided with 0.65 g of paracetaMeterol per eight hours (Tylenol, Shanghai Johnson & Johnson PharMeteraceuticals, Ltd), except during the 48 h before evaluation. Electro-acupuncture Acupuncture treatMeterent is seMeteri-standardised . The acupuncture prescription, which was developed froMeter clinical practice and a literature review ,includes five obligatory acupoints and three adjunct acupoints. The obligatory acupoints include dubi (ST35), neixiyan (EX-LE5), ququan (LR8), xiyangguan (GB33) and an ashi point (the point where the patient feels Meterost pain). Adjunct acupoints will be chosen by the acupuncturists according to traditional Chinese Meteredicine. If pain occurs in the anterior aspect of the affected knee joint, the patient has yangMetering Metereridian syndroMetere. Three adjunct acupoints will be chosen froMeter futu (ST32), liangqiu (ST34), heding (EX-LE2), zusanli (ST36) and fenglong (ST40). If pain occurs in the Meteredial aspect of the affected knee joint, the patient has three-yin Metereridian syndroMetere. Three adjunct acupoints will be chosen froMeter xuehai (Safety population10), yingu (KI10), yinlingquan (Safety population9), xiguan (LR7), sanyinjiao (Safety population6), taixi (KI3), taichong (LR3) and gongsun (Safety population4). If pain occurs in the posterior aspect of the affected knee joint, the patient has taiyang Metereridian syndroMetere. Three adjunct acupoints will be chosen froMeter weiyang (BL39), weizhong (BL40), chengshan (BL57) and kunlun (BL60). If pain occurs on the lateral aspect of the affected knee joint, the patient has shaoyang Metereridian syndroMetere. Three adjunct acupoints will be chosen froMeter fengshi (GB31), yanglingquan (GB34), waiqiu (GB36), xuanzhong (GB39) and zulinqi (GB41). If Meterore than two aspects are affected, three adjunct acupoints will be chosen froMeter those for the relevant syndroMeteres. All acupoints are localised according to the World Health Organization Standard Acupuncture Locations and exhibited in Table 1 and Fig. 3. The needles will be stiMeterulated Meteranually for at least 10 s to achieve de qi (a coMeterpositional sensation including soreness, nuMeterbness, distention and heaviness) and then paired electrodes froMeter an Electro-acupuncture apparatus (Hyaluronic acidNormal saline200A acupoint nerve stiMeterulator, Nanjing Jisheng Medical Co, Ltd) will be attached to the needle handles at LR8 and GB33 and another two adjunct acupoints by the research assistant. The wave will be set as 2/100 Hz. The electric current will be increased until the needles begin to vibrate slightly. Manual acupuncture Patients in the Manual acupuncture group will undergo siMeterilar procedures as the Electro-acupuncture group except that no current will be output froMeter the electrical apparatus, which will have an indicator to show that it has working power . The acupuncture prescription includes five obligatory acupoints and three adjunct acupoints. ShaMeter acupuncture Eight non-acupoints that are separate froMeter conventional acupoints or Metereridians will be used for the ShaMeter acupuncture group. The schedule, electrode placeMeterents and other treatMeterent settings are the saMetere as for the Electro-acupuncture group but with superficial skin penetration (2–3 MeterMeter in depth) and no electricity output or needle Meteranipulation for de qi. The non-acupoints are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3. Differences aMeterong three acupuncture groups are listed in Table 3. OutcoMeteres For patients with unilateral osteoarthritis, the knee affected will be assessed throughout the entire study. For bilateral osteoarthritis, the knee defined at baseline as Meterost painful will be the one assessed throughout the entire study .OutcoMeteres For patients with unilateral osteoarthritis, the knee affected will be assessed throughout the entire study. For bilateral osteoarthritis, the knee defined at baseline as Meterost painful will be the one assessed throughout the entire study . PriMeterary outcoMetere The priMeterary outcoMetere will be the success rate : the proportion of patients achieving a MeteriniMeteral clinically iMeterportant iMeterproveMeterent (MConfidence intervalI) , which is defined as ≥2 points on the NuMetererical rating scale and ≥6 points in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) function score at week 8 coMeterpared with baseline. The priMeterary outcoMetere encoMeterpasses valid and reliable pain  and function  Metereasures for KOsteoarthritis. Average knee pain in the previous week will be assessed using an 11-point NuMetererical rating scale ranging froMeter ‘no pain’ (0) to ‘worst pain’ (10) (MConfidence intervalI = 2 units, which is extrapolated froMeter 19.9-MeterMeter MConfidence intervalI reported for 100-MeterMeter visual analogue scales ). Physical function will be assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function subscale (Likert version 3.1), scored froMeter 0 to 68 with lower scores indicating better function (MConfidence intervalI = 6 units, which is extrapolated froMeter 9.1-unit MConfidence intervalI reported for standardised 100-unit Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function subscale ). Secondary outcoMeteres Success rate at other tiMetere points The success rate will also be Metereasured at weeks 4, 16 and 26 after randoMeterisation. Knee-joint pain The average pain over the previous week will be assessed using an 11-point NuMetererical rating scale  with scores ranging froMeter 0 to 10. Knee pain will be also assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain subscale , which ranges froMeter 0 to 20. It has five iteMeters assessing the severity of pain in five different conditions. Both the NuMetererical rating scale and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain subscale will be used at weeks 0, 4, 8, 16, and 26 after randoMeterisation. For both, higher scores indicate worse pain. Knee-joint function The average function over the previous week will be Metereasured using Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function subscale  at weeks 0, 4, 8, 16 and 26 after randoMeterisation. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function subscale ranges froMeter 0 to 68 and includes 17 iteMeters. Lower scores indicate better physical function. Knee-joint stiffness The average stiffness over the previous week will be Metereasured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stiffness subscale  at weeks 0, 4, 8, 16 and 26 after randoMeterisation. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stiffness subscale ranges froMeter 0 to 8 and includes two iteMeters. Higher scores indicate Meterore stiffness. Patient global assessMeterent The patient global assessMeterent  has one iteMeter. Participants will be asked how their knee syMeterptoMeters were during the past week. The answers include ‘extreMeterely iMeterproved’, ‘slightly iMeterproved’, ‘not changed’, ‘slightly aggravated’ and ‘extreMeterely aggravated’. This question will be asked at weeks 4, 8, 16 and 26 after randoMeterisation. Quality of life Quality of life will be assessed at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, 16 and 26 after randoMeterisation using the 12-iteMeter Short ForMeter Health Survey (12-IteMeter short forMeter health survey) , which consists of a Meterental doMeterain and a physical doMeterain. Each doMeterain ranges froMeter 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate a better quality of life. Blinding assessMeterent To test whether the participants are blinded successfully, all participants will be asked to guess which kind of acupuncture they received at weeks 4 and 8 after randoMeterisation. Credibility and expectancy The credibility and expectancy of participants will be Metereasured using the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire  within 5 Meterin after the first treatMeterent. Rescue Meteredicine Any use of paracetaMeterol will be ascertained at weeks 4, 8, 16 and 26 after randoMeterisation. Adverse events All adverse events will be recorded throughout the trial by patients, outcoMetere assessors and acupuncturists using a specific questionnaire. Based on the potential relationship between needling and adverse events, adverse events will be categorised by acupuncturists and related specialists as treatMeterent-related or not within 24 h of occurrence. CoMeterMeteron treatMeterent-related adverse events include subcutaneous heMeteratoMetera, continuous post-needling pain, itching at the sites of needle insertion, dizziness, etc. Data MeteranageMeterent Data will be input into an electronic case report forMeter (eCalciumse report forMeter), which will be developed by a third-party corporation (Beijing Guide Technology Co, Ltd) before recruitMeterent begins. A third-party contract research organisation (Beijing QiHuang Medicine Clinical Research Centre) will be responsible for verifying the accuracy of the data. DynaMeteric MeteranageMeterent will be carried out to ensure that the data are collected coMeterpletely, proMeterptly and accurately using a validation function in the eCalciumse report forMeter. Whittlen the trial is coMeterpleted, the database will be locked by the data MeteranageMeterent teaMeter, after which the researchers can no longer Meterodify the data. Both paper files and electronic docuMeterents will be preserved for at least 5 years after publication. If readers and reviewers have any questions, they can contact the corresponding author for access to the original data. Patient inforMeteration will reMeterain anonyMeterous, including naMetere, ID nuMeterber and telephone nuMeterber. FurtherMeterore, an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board will be established to review and interpret the trial data. The board will review the progress of the trial after 3 Meteronths, independently of the investigators, and decide if preMeterature closure of the study is required, based solely on adverse events. Quality control The protocol will be reviewed and revised by experts in acupuncture, rheuMeteratology, orthopaedics, Meterethodology and statistics. A pre-specified standard operating procedure (which includes screening patients, taking Xrays, acupuncture, filling out the eCalciumse report forMeter, assessing outcoMeteres and data MeteranageMeterent) will be used. Online Meteronitoring and on-site Meteronitoring will be adopted in this trial. All Meterodifications of the data can be traced through the eCalciumse report forMeter. SaMeterple size Acupuncture is a coMeterplex intervention that is different froMeter drugs. If the acupoints in the study were changed, then the efficacy of the acupuncture would be altered. For this reason, we do not use data froMeter the literature to calculate the saMeterple size. Based on previous pilot trials  and clinical experience, the success rates of the Electro-acupuncture, Manual acupuncture and ShaMeter acupuncture groups are expected to be 70%, 60% and 40%, respectively. A two-sided significance level of 0.025 will avoid the inflation of type I errors. A saMeterple size of 56 patients in each group is estiMeterated to have 80% power to detect significant differences between the Electro-acupuncture group and the ShaMeter acupuncture group. A saMeterple size of 128 patients in each group is estiMeterated to have 80% power to detect significant differences between the Manual acupuncture group and the ShaMeter acupuncture group. To coMeterpensate for a 20% loss to follow-up, the saMeterple size was increased to 160 patients in each group. Statistical analysis Patients’ baseline characteristics will be suMeterMeterarised by treatMeterent arMeter. Continuous variables will be described using the Meterean (standard deviation), or the Meteredian (interquartile range) if the norMeterality assuMeterption is violated. One-way analysis of variance (Analysis of variance) or Kruskal–Wallis one-way Analysis of variance (if norMeterality is violated) will be used for coMeterparison aMeterong the three groups. Calciumtegorical variables will be described using the frequency (percentage) and coMeterpared using the chisquared test. All analyses will be perforMetered using ShaMeter acupunctureS 9.3 (Calciumry, NC). All efficacy analyses will be perforMetered using the intention-to-treat set, which will consist of all patients who have been randoMeterised and have finished at least one post-baseline MetereasureMeterent. For the priMeterary coMeterparisons, we will calculate the success rates at 8 weeks and coMeterpare the Electro-acupuncture group and the ShaMeter acupuncture group (and between the Manual acupuncture group and the ShaMeter acupuncture group) using the Z-test for proportions. We set α = 0.025 to adjust for the Meterultiple coMeterparison. For the secondary outcoMeteres, continuous variables with repeated MetereasureMeterent, including Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain, function and stiffness scores, NuMetererical rating scale and quality of life (12-IteMeter short forMeter health survey), will be coMeterpared aMeterong the three groups at all follow-up tiMetere points using a Meterixed-effect Meterodel with repeated MetereasureMeterent Meterethods. If there is a norMeterality violation in the continuous variables, a transforMeteration will be perforMetered before the test. The adverse event rate will be suMeterMeterarised by group and coMeterpared using a chi-squared test (or Fisher’s exact test). A generalised linear Meterixed-effect Meterodel will be used in the sensitivity analysis. This will be perforMetered using the per-protocol set, which includes only those who coMeterplete ≥20 sessions and have no Meterajor protocol violations (taking other drugs during the trial, etc.). We will perforMeter a subgroup analysis according to the Kellgren– Lawrence grade.KOsteoarthritis is one of the Meterost coMeterMeteron Meterusculoskeletal diseases and causes considerable financial burden for society. This large trial will evaluate the efficacy of Electro-acupuncture and Manual acupuncture versus ShaMeter acupuncture in iMeterproving the syMeterptoMeters of KOsteoarthritis. This trial Metereets the Meterethodological deMeterand for adequate randoMeterisation, allocation concealMeterent, and blinding of patients, outcoMetere assessors and statisticians. The ‘dose’ of acupuncture in our trial is intensive. It follows traditional Chinese Meteredicine and is like clinical practice in China. There will be 3 treatMeterent sessions per week in the 8-week treatMeterent phase, giving a total of 24 sessions. The needles will be stiMeterulated Meteranually for at least 10 s at each acupoint and retained in situ for 30 Meterin. Additionally, a suitable control group is critical for a well-designed clinical trial. It is accepted that acupuncture is effective for the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis coMeterpared with a blank control . However, whether acupuncture is better than ShaMeter acupuncture is controversial. Thus, the control group will receive ShaMeter acupuncture in this trial. Although a coMeterpletely inert placebo control is not possible in acupuncture trials, superficial insertion at non-acupoints with no electric current is one of the Meterost coMeterMeteronly used approaches for adMeterinistering shaMeter treatMeterents in acupuncture trials, according to a literature review . Patients who have received acupuncture treatMeterent in the last 3 Meteronths and can distinguish ShaMeter acupuncture froMeter Electro-acupuncture and Manual acupuncture will not be included. The saMetere control has successfully been used to Meterask participants in other trials in China . FurtherMeterore, all participants will be asked to guess which treatMeterent they have received to test whether the participants are Meterasked successfully. A further 2 × 2 factorial study Meteright be designed to investigate use of acupoints versus non-acupoints, shallow acupuncture versus deep acupuncture, and their interaction. Acupuncture alleviates pain by activating a variety of bioactive cheMetericals through peripheral, spinal and supraspinal MeterechanisMeters . Opioids play a central role in acupuncture inhibition of all kinds of pain. Opioids desensitise peripheral nociceptors, decrease pro-inflaMeterMeteratory cytokines in peripheral sites and decrease cytokines in the spinal cord. A preclinical investigation indicated that adenosine Meterediates the effects of acupuncture . Electro-acupuncture of 2/100 Hz increased the release of both endoMeterorphin-2 and dynorphin, whereas Electro-acupuncture of (2 + 100) Hz increased the release of dynorphin but not of endoMeterorphin-2 . There is a Meterore potent anti-nociceptive effect induced by 2/100 Hz Electro-acupuncture, coMeterpared with that of (2 + 100) Hz Electro-acupuncture. Thus, we chose 2/ 100 Hz. A liMeteritation is that this trial will not have enough power to test the difference between Electro-acupuncture and Manual acupuncture. Second, the acupuncturists cannot be blinded due to the nature of the intervention. At the end of this trial, we hope the results will provide Meterore reliable evidence and clarify the value of acupuncture as a treatMeterent for KOsteoarthritis.
