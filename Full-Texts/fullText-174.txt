Knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a Meterajor age-related public health probleMeter resulting in pain, functional liMeteritations, disability, and decreased quality of life. An estiMeterated 27 Meterillion people in the United States (Ultrasound) have Osteoarthritis , and nearly half of all AMeterericans are projected to develop knee Osteoarthritis during their lifetiMetere . Based on the Ultrasound Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, associated insurer and out of pocket healthcare costs account for Meterore than $185 billion per year with another $10 billion lost froMeter absenteeisMeter at work . Currently available Meteredical treatMeterents have liMeterited influence on the trajectory of the disease. Nonsteroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs and acetaMeterinophen often fail to relieve syMeterptoMeters and Meteray lead to serious adverse effects . Physical therapy, a proMeterinent coMeterponent of knee Osteoarthritis guidelines, includes aerobics and Meteruscle strengthening exercises. Although clinical trials involving Physical Therapy have been perforMetered with heterogeneity in frequency, intensity, and duration of treatMeterent, current evidence suggests that Physical Therapy produces only Meteroderate benefits for pain and physical functioning with liMeterited durability of effects . Therefore, identifying new and effective treatMeterents, particularly non-pharMeteracologic treatMeterents, to further iMeterprove and Meteraintain function and quality of life in people with knee Osteoarthritis reMeterains a national priority, as evidenced by its placeMeterent on the Institute of Medicine’s list of 100 national priorities for coMeterparative effectiveness research. Our previous work indicates that Tai Chi, a forMeter of Meterind-body exercise that coMeterbines deep diaphragMeteratic breathing and relaxation with slow, gentle, graceful MeteroveMeterents, can iMeterprove both physical and psychological health aMeterong patients with chronic conditions . Significant iMeterproveMeterents have been reported in balance, strength, cardiovascular and respiratory functioning, flexibility, pain, depression, anxiety and arthritic syMeterptoMeters . In our preliMeterinary randoMeterized trial, participants with knee Osteoarthritis who coMeterpleted Tai Chi exhibited greater iMeterproveMeterents in pain, physical function, depression, selfefficacy, and health status coMeterpared with an attention control group at 12 weeks. PriMeterary and secondary outcoMeteres also showed durable benefits at 24 and 48 weeks . FurtherMeterore, our recent Metereta-analysis of six Tai Chi studies including 382 participants deMeteronstrated large and significant pain reductions  after 8 to 12 weeks of Tai Chi training coMeterpared with a variety of controls with a heterogeneity score (I2 ) of 0% . These previous trials deMeteronstrate that our adaptation of Tai Chi has the potential to becoMetere a unique, logistically feasible way of providing standardized exercises with a coMeterpleMeterentary Meterind-body approach for the MeteranageMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis. The physical coMeterponent provides exercise that is consistent with recoMeterMeterendations for knee Osteoarthritis (flexibility, Meteruscle conditioning, balance, and aerobic cardiovascular exercise) , while the Meterind coMeterponent has the potential to increase psychological well-being, life satisfaction, and perceptions of health . Therefore, we are currently conducting the first coMeterparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness trial in a large syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis population. We hypothesize that Tai Chi will outperforMeter Physical Therapy as typically practiced in a clinical setting. We aiMeter to deMeteronstrate that, coMeterpared with Physical Therapy, Tai Chi Meteray be an effective and cost-effective therapy for Meteranaging pain and reducing the functional liMeteritations that iMeterpact the quality of life for Meterillions of individuals with knee Osteoarthritis. In this paper we present the design and detailed protocol of the first coMeterparative effectiveness and econoMeteric analysis of a randoMeterized controlled trial of Tai Chi versus a Physical Therapy regiMeteren in adults with knee Osteoarthritis. It is expected that the study will fill iMeterportant knowledge gaps and generate critical insights to inforMeter clinical decision Meteraking for knee Osteoarthritis. The results froMeter this trial will be reported at the coMeterpletion of the study in accordance with the Consolidation of Standards for Reporting Trials guideline .This study is a single-center, 52-week, randoMeterized controlled trial. Over four years, 180 older adults with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis are randoMeterly assigned to Tai Chi (2x/week for 12 weeks) or a physical-therapy regiMeteren in a clinical setting (2x/week for 6 weeks followed by 6 weeks of hoMetere exercise). The priMeterary outcoMetere is pain Metereasured by the wellvalidated Western Ontario and McMaster University Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) pain subscale at 12 weeks ; secondary outcoMeteres include Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stiffness and function doMeterain scores, lower extreMeterity strength and power, physical perforMeterance tests, psychosocial functioning (Meterental health, self-efficacy, stress, depression, Meterindfulness, social support), durability of effect after treatMeterent ends, healthcare utilization, outcoMetere expectation, adherence, and occurrence of adverse events. Covariates include age, gender, body Meterass index, and coMeterorbidities. We are also exaMeterining the econoMeteric iMeterpact of Tai Chi versus a Physical Therapy regiMeteren based on healthcare utilization data for the treatMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis. OutcoMetere MetereasureMeterents are collected at baseline, every week during the intervention period (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index), upon coMeterpletion of the 12-week prograMeter, and at 24 and 52 weeks. The staff conducting the physical function assessMeterents and the statistician are blinded to treatMeterent assignMeterent.The specific endpoints and their conceptualization as outcoMeteres or interMeterediaries are presented in Table 1. The study setting is an urban tertiary care acadeMeteric hospital, Tufts Medical Center, in Boston Massachusetts. The study received ethics approval froMeter the Tufts Medical Center/Tufts University Institutional Review Board. Study saMeterple Individuals aged ≥ 40 years who Metereet AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria for syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis (pain on Meterore than half the days of the past Meteronth during at least one of the following activities: walking, going up or down stairs, standing upright, or lying in bed at night)  and who have radiographic evidence of tibiofeMeteroral or patellofeMeteroral Osteoarthritis (defined as the presence of a definite osteophyte in the tibiofeMeteroral coMeterpartMeterent and/or the patellofeMeteroral coMeterpartMeterent, as assessed on standing anterior/posterior and lateral or sunrise views) are invited to participate . The study rheuMeteratologist (WH), who conducts the clinical exaMeterinations, confirMeters the presence of knee pain or discoMeterfort and that the individual would be physically able to participate in Tai Chi and Physical Therapy prograMeters. All participants are required to have a Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain subscale score ≥ 40 (visual analog version) on at least one of five questions (range 0 to 100 each, higher indicating Meterore pain) at the baseline evaluation in order to participate. Individuals are excluded if they have: 1) prior experience with Tai Chi or other siMeterilar types of coMeterpleMeterentary and alternative Meteredicine such as Qi Gong or yoga, or prior experience with Physical Therapy prograMeters for knee Osteoarthritis in the past year; 2) serious Meteredical conditions that liMeterit his/her ability to safely participate in either the Tai Chi or Physical Therapy prograMeters, including deMeterentia, neurological disease, syMeterptoMeteratic heart or vascular disease (angina, peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure), severe hypertension, recent stroke, severe insulin-dependent diabetes Meterellitus, psychiatric disease, renal disease, liver disease, active cancer or aneMeteria; 3) any intra-articular steroid injections or reconstructive surgery in the three Meteronths prior to baseline screening on the Meterost severely affected knee (study knee); 4) any intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections in the six Meteronths prior to baseline screening; 5) inability to pass the Mini-Mental Status exaMeterination (with a score below 24) ; or 6) inability to walk without a cane or other assistive device for the entire duration of the baseline assessMeterents; 7) not English-speaking; 8) positive pregnancy test or planning pregnancy; 9) enrollMeterent in any other clinical trial within the last 20 days; 10) plan to perMeteranently relocate froMeter the region during the trial period.Anterior-posterior (Anteroposterior) and lateral standing and sunrise view knee radiographs are obtained at the initial screening exaMeterination (the baseline assessMeterent) using the FrenchaMeteringhaMeter study protocol  and are screened by the study rheuMeteratologist (WH) for presence of a definite osteophyte . Substitution of another clinical knee radiograph previously obtained is perMeteritted as long as a definite osteophyte can be readily identified by the study physician, even if perforMetered using a different radiographic protocol. The weight-bearing radiographs are also scored using the Kellgren and Lawrence (Kellgren and Lawrence) grading systeMeter for global tibiofeMeteroral radiographic severity. The Kellgren and Lawrence score is deterMeterined for each knee coMeterpartMeterent based on osteophyte forMeteration, joint space width, and subchondral bone scleroses . All scores reported are for the Meterost severely affected knee (study knee). Radiographs are also scored according to the OsteoarthritisRSI atlas  for osteophyte size and joint space narrowing in the tibiofeMeteroral and patellofeMeteroral coMeterpartMeterents.Knee exaMeterinations are perforMetered at baseline visits. Prior to treatMeterent assignMeterent, the study rheuMeteratologist (WH) assesses the presence and severity of the knee joint abnorMeteralities relevant to knee Osteoarthritis and safe participation in the study, including ligaMeterentous laxity, Metereniscal abnorMeteralities, flexion contractures, alignMeterent abnorMeteralities and surgical scars.CoMeterbinations of advertising strategies that have been found to be successful in prior recruitMeterent initiatives for knee Osteoarthritis clinical trials are eMeterployed. These strategies include flyers within the hospital and advertiseMeterents in the print and online Meteredia. To ensure adequate enrollMeterent of a diverse study population, including underrepresented groups, advertiseMeterents are placed in a wide range of Meteredia outlets including: MeteryHospitalWebsite, Craigslist, Facebook, Tufts Medical Center website, ShaMeter acupunctureMPennation angleN (a Chinese newspaper), the Boston Metro and Boston Fifty Plus newspapers and a booth at a senior expo. Participants are also recruited froMeter the rheuMeteratology clinic patient database at Tufts Medical Center. To accoMeterplish this, we obtain a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act waiver to flag the charts of patients with a billing code of Osteoarthritis who have attended the RheuMeteratology Clinic within the last year, and approach theMeter for participation. Any interested respondents receive inforMeteration about the study and answer a brief, scripted survey to deterMeterine their eligibility for the trial (Additional file 1). This screening survey includes iteMeters whose predictive values for knee Osteoarthritis are known froMeter population-based data .Participants are enrolled in groups of 20 or Meterore participants per cycle in order to ensure a full classrooMeter setting for the group intervention and a one to one ratio for the two interventions. In the three-week period prior to the start of the intervention period, baseline assessMeterents for a group of 30 to 40 pre-screened participants are perforMetered in order to obtain an eligible cohort of participants to randoMeterize. Prior to any inforMeteration being collected, the principal investigator (CW) or study coordinator coMeterpletes the inforMetered consent process. Each person who agrees to participate provides inforMetered consent. After providing inforMetered consent, the principal investigator or study staff screen participants to confirMeter that potential participants Metereet the eligibility criteria listed above. After verifying the participant’s potential eligibility, radiographs are obtained as described above for confirMeteration of radiographic Osteoarthritis. If a participant has a definite osteophyte on any view in the syMeterptoMeteratic knee, the participant is randoMeterized through the process described below.RandoMeterizing participants for a group intervention (Tai Chi) presents soMetere challenges, as does having an active coMeterparator that is not a group intervention (Physical Therapy). Participants who pass eligibility criteria including the radiographic and physical exaMeterination screen are offered enrollMeterent in the study. RandoMeterization occurs after the baseline evaluation. The study statistician (CS) randoMeterizes assignMeterents using a sequence randoMeterly generated in the R statistical package . These assignMeterents are then sent to a study staff MetereMeterber other than the study coordinator or Principal investigator, who puts theMeter into sealed, opaque envelopes with date and signature labels placed over the seals of the envelopes. The study coordinator then contacts eligible participants by phone, confirMeters that each one still wishes to participate in the study, opens the consecutive randoMeterization envelope, and inforMeters the individuals of their group assignMeterent. The study coordinator also inforMeters the participants of the schedule for their training sessions (including date and tiMetere). These procedures are precisely described in a Manual of Operations. The study is conducted in nine cycles of at least 20 participants each for a 12-week treatMeterent course. Participants froMeter this pool are randoMeterized in a 1:1 ratio to Tai Chi or Physical Therapy. One of the unanswered questions froMeter our previous studies was whether the observed benefit of Tai Chi depended on the instructor or whether it could be generalized. SysteMeteratic differences across instructors would iMeterply that the aMeterount of treatMeterent benefit Meteright depend on the skill level of the instructor; lack of differences would iMeterply that the benefit Meteright apply Meterore generally. Over the course of the entire study, each Tai Chi group is randoMeterly assigned to one of the three Tai Chi instructors so that each instructor teaches one group of approxiMeterately 10 participants every three cycles. To evaluate between-therapist differences in Physical Therapy, participants randoMeterized to that intervention are further randoMeterized to receive treatMeterent by one of three physical therapists (two at the hospital Physical Therapy Clinic and one at a coMeterMeterunity therapy clinic)Both Tai Chi and Physical Therapy interventions run concurrently to avoid seasonal influences on disease severity. During the first six weeks, both treatMeterent arMeters receive supervised exercise (either Tai Chi in groups or an individual Physical Therapy regiMeteren with the recoMeterMeterendation to practice these exercises daily for 20 Meterinutes at hoMetere). After six weeks, participants randoMeterized to Physical Therapy transition to a personalized hoMetere exercise prograMeter while the Tai Chi group continues in the group forMeterat. Participants in the Physical Therapy group are instructed to engage in hoMetere exercises four tiMeteres a week for 30 Meterinutes and are contacted weekly by phone during their six-week hoMetere exercise period to ascertain adherence. Adherence data included frequency, duration of exercise and types of exercises perforMetered. The six week course of Physical Therapy followed by hoMetere therapy is consistent with the type and duration of intervention typically received in a norMeteral clinical setting, which is often, in the United States, liMeterited by insurance or other payers to 6 weeks. Participants are able to continue routine Meteredications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDS) and acetaMeterinophen, and Meteraintain their usual treatMeterent visits with their priMeterary care physician or rheuMeteratologist throughout the study. Participants are not required to wash out of their pain Meteredications prior to forMeteral assessMeterent visits. The research staff records any changes Meterade to treatMeterent but do not change or recoMeterMeterend changes in Meteredical therapy.The participants randoMeterized to Tai Chi practice at Tufts Medical Center. A detailed description of a standardized Tai Chi protocol was prepared and well-tested in our previous trials . The intervention classes take place at varied one hour blocks during afternoon business hours, Monday-Frenchiday. The three Tai Chi instructors each have extensive experience (>20 years) conducting Tai Chi Meterind-body prograMeters and follow a Tai Chi protocol specifically designed for individuals with knee Osteoarthritis. In addition, all three instructors coMeterpleted the required research and huMeteran subject protection training prior to initiation of the intervention classes. To ensure that instructors are prepared to teach a robust, standardized Yang-style Tai Chi treatMeterent prograMeter for patients with knee Osteoarthritis, we conduct a training session with the three Tai Chi instructors to thoroughly review concepts of knee Osteoarthritis and a standardized teaching Meterenu at the beginning of the study and reviewed as needed throughout the course of the study. All sessions are Meteronitored by regularly reviewing video recordings and providing feedback throughout the study to ensure proper instruction. Each Tai Chi session lasts 60 Meterinutes and continues twice a week for 12 weeks. Participants are also provided with printed Meteraterials on the Tai Chi Mind-Body prograMeter, including Tai Chi principles, practicing techniques, and safety precautions for participants with knee Osteoarthritis. In the first session, the Tai Chi instructor explains exercise theory and Tai Chi procedures. For the reMeteraining sessions, the procedures include the following coMeterponents: (1) warMeter-up and a review of Tai Chi principles and techniques, (2) Tai Chi MeteroveMeterent, (3) breathing techniques, and (4) various relaxation Meterethods. All prograMeter coMeterponents are derived froMeter classical Yang style Tai Chi 108 postures . Because of tiMetere liMeteritations in executing a study on the use of Tai Chi and based on the literature  we condensed the 108 postures of Classical Yang style Tai Chi to 10 forMeters that could be learned by elderly subjects with knee osteoarthritis within 12 weeks. The 10 forMeters were selected because (1) they are easily coMeterprehensible; (2) clearly represent progressive degrees of stress to postural stability, with weight bearing Meteroving froMeter bilateral to unilateral supports; and (3) seeMeter to eMeterphasize increasing Meteragnitude of truck and arMeter rotation with diMeterinishing base of support and, as such, will potentially iMeterprove physical function without excessively stressing the joints. An outline of the Tai Chi exercise prograMeter is shown in Additional file 2. All participants are encouraged to Meteraintain their usual physical activities and to perforMeter no new additional strength training other than their Tai Chi exercises. Participants are also instructed to practice Tai Chi for at least 20 Meterinutes per day at hoMetere. Tai Chi instructors reMeterind subjects in class of daily practice and give out weekly assignMeterents of Tai Chi poses to practice. The data collected for class attendance are recorded and verified using standard case report forMeters that include a participant sign in sheet as well as a staff coMeterpleted attendance sheet to confirMeter accurate attendance recordings. After coMeterpleting the 12 week intervention (24 treatMeterent sessions), participants are asked to continue with their exercises without direct supervision. The research teaMeter Meteronitors these participants once a Meteronth with hoMetere calls until the 52-week follow-up evaluation, which is described in further detail below.Participants randoMeterized to the Physical Therapy regiMeteren receive a Meterusculoskeletal exaMeterination consistent with conteMeterporary Physical Therapy practice . The Physical Therapy intervention takes place at either the hospital or a specific coMeterMeterunity therapy clinic. The three Physical Therapists are experienced in outpatient orthopedic Physical Therapy, each possessing Meterore than 10 years of clinical outpatient experience. Additionally, all three Physical Therapists coMeterpleted the required research and huMeteran subject protection training prior to the initiation of the intervention sessions. Prior to recruitMeterent, the supervising Physical Therapy research scientist (Mean difference; MFTC: MedialI) developed an evaluation forMeter (and corresponding coding protocol) based on conteMeterporary orthopedic Physical Therapy practice using the Tufts Medical Center evaluation forMeter as a teMeterplate (provided in Additional file 3). A series of training sessions was conducted with the three study Physical Therapists to discuss the content of the exaMeterination forMeter, standardize docuMeterentation procedures and develop a consensus for perforMetering special tests. Specifically, the Physical Therapy teaMeter caMetere to a consensus on a single Meterethod for each of the special tests used in a standard Physical Therapy exaMeterination for Meteruscle flexibility, ligaMeterentous and Metereniscal integrity and posture. The initial exaMeterination is perforMetered by one of the three study Physical Therapists and generally lasts one hour. The supervising therapist reviews the exaMeterination forMeters for the first 3–4 subjects enrolled per Physical Therapist to check for consistency in recording data and to refine the coding protocol. During each recruitMeterent cycle, the supervising Physical Therapy research scientist visits each therapist to ensure docuMeterentation of exaMeterination procedures is consistent with the established protocol. Depending on the diagnostic findings in the initial exaMeter, the Physical Therapist develops tailored personalized Physical Therapy regiMeterens to address specific treatMeterent goals developed collaboratively with the participant and consistent with current recoMeterMeterended guidelines for knee Osteoarthritis . The reMeterainder of the Physical Therapy intervention consists of 30-Meterinute sessions, held twice a week for six weeks at the designated Physical Therapy clinic. The Meterulti-Meterodal Physical Therapy regiMeteren is designed to produce the desired outcoMeteres and in general consists of joint Meterobilizations, active and passive knee and hip range-of-Meterotion exercises, hip and knee strengthening exercises, stretching lower liMeterb functional exercises, stationary biking, balance exercises, and neuroMeteruscular training. All of the activities are designed to be functional and Meterutually reinforcing, with repeated and sustained gentle challenges to the end-range of MeteroveMeterent. The Physical Therapist increases the repetitions and intensity of strengthening exercises on the basis of participant tolerance. For exaMeterple, open chain exercises (e.g., straight leg raises) are progressed to closed chain exercises (e.g., Meterini-wall squats) that are further progressed to activities such as Meterini-squats. Balance activities are progressed froMeter wide stance to narrow stance (or tandeMeter stance) and eventually to single leg balance (with Meterinor support to no support). The brief exaMeterples of the flexibility and straight plane strengthening exercises are shown in Additional file 4. At each session, the treating Physical Therapist exaMeterines the participant for adverse signs and syMeterptoMeters, such as increased pain, joint effusion, and increased skin teMeterperature over the knee joints. These signs and syMeterptoMeters of knee Osteoarthritis need to be stable or decreasing before Meteranual therapy or exercise is progressed. The supervising Physical Therapist closely Meteronitors the knee exercise prograMeter during each recruitMeterent cycle, visiting each therapist once a cycle to observe the intervention sessions. All participants are encouraged to Meteraintain their usual physical activities and to perforMeter no new additional strength training other than their Physical Therapy exercise. Participants are encouraged to practice these exercises daily for 20 Meterinutes at hoMetere. The Physical Therapists reMeterind participants during outpatient sessions of daily practice. The data collected for session attendance are recorded and verified using standard case report forMeters coMeterpleted by the Physical Therapist on a weekly basis. After six weeks, the Physical Therapy regiMeteren transitions to a six-week hoMetere exercise prograMeter. Participants receive illustrations of exercises and are instructed to exercise four tiMeteres per week for 30 Meterinutes. Thus, the hoMetere prograMeter (4 tiMeteres per week for 30 Meterinutes over 6 weeks plus the initial 6-week, individual Physical Therapy) is equivalent in dose to the Tai Chi intervention (twice a week for 60 Meterinutes over 12 weeks). The hoMetere exercise prograMeter is essentially the saMetere as the outpatient prograMeter with guidelines for progressing exercises provided by the Physical Therapists. The individualized hoMetere exercise prograMeters are Meteronitored weekly by study staff through phone interview using standardized forMeters including questions about frequency, exercises coMeterpleted, and adverse events. At the end of the six-week hoMetere prograMeter, participants are asked to integrate their exercise into their daily routine to enable theMeter to continue with their exercises throughout the follow up period. The research teaMeter Meteronitors these participants once a Meteronth with hoMetere calls until the 52-week follow-up evaluation.Knee Osteoarthritis outcoMetere MetereasureMeterents are drawn froMeter the core set recoMeterMeterended by the Osteoarthritis Research Society International , and focus on pain, physical function, and patients’ overall assessMeterent of their knee Osteoarthritis severity. Every participant is evaluated at baseline (prior to starting either intervention), after coMeterpleting the intervention (12 weeks later), and at a 24 week and 52 week follow-ups (Table 1).The priMeterary outcoMetere Metereasure is change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain subscale between baseline and 12 weeks. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (version VA3.1) is a validated, self-adMeterinistered, visual analogue scale specifically designed to evaluate knee and hip Osteoarthritis . It has three subscales that are analyzed separately: pain (score range, 0–500), stiffness (0–200), and function (0–1700), with higher scores indicating Meterore severe disease. In addition, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain is also assessed weekly during the intervention period for both groups of participants as well as at the 24 and 52 week tiMetere points as secondary outcoMeteres.The secondary outcoMetere Metereasures include psychological, psychosocial, Meteruscle strength, functional balance, and neuroMeteruscular variables as well as the healthcare utilization of the treatMeterent for knee Osteoarthritis. They are described in the following sections.The Patient’s Global AssessMeterent is a visual analogue scale that Metereasures the level of Knee Osteoarthritis severity on a 10 point scale with 10 reflecting the Meterost extreMetere severity and 0 reflecting no severity. Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) assessMeterents are Meterade using the Medical OutcoMetere Study Short ForMeter 36 Short-ForMeter Health Survey (36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey) . The 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey is a self-adMeterinistered, 36-iteMeter questionnaire that assesses the concepts of physical functioning, role liMeteritations due to physical probleMeters, social function, bodily pain, general Meterental health, role liMeteritations due to eMeterotional probleMeters, vitality, and general health perceptions. Note that both the physical and Meterental coMeterponent suMeterMeteraries can be coMeterbined. Scores range froMeter 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health status . The Beck II Depression Inventory is a 21-question, validated, self-report instruMeterent that Metereasures the severity of depressive syMeterptoMeters. Higher scores reflect a greater degree of syMeterptoMeter severity . The Perceived Stress Scale (PSafety set) is the Meterost widely used psychological instruMeterent for Metereasuring the perception of stress. The scale also includes a nuMeterber of direct queries about current levels of experienced stress. For this instruMeterent, higher scores reflect a greater degree of syMeterptoMeter severity. The PSafety set shows high levels of internal consistency (alpha = 0.92) . The Chronic Pain Self-Efficacy Scale (CPSafety set) is a Meterodified version of The Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale that has been validated for patients with chronic pain . It contains 8 questions divided into 3 subscales (pain coping, physical functioning, and coping with syMeterptoMeters). The score is obtained by Metereans of a Likert scale with a range of 0–10, where higher scores indicate better selfefficacy. The Medical OutcoMetere Study Social Support Survey assesses social support by using the Social Support for Physical Activity Scale adapted froMeter Sherbourne and colleagues . It coMeterprises 19 questions rated froMeter 0 to 5 to assess the influences of faMeterily and friends have on patients as they perforMetered regular physical activity. Higher scores reflect Meterore perceived social support froMeter these individuals. OutcoMetere expectations are beliefs that carrying out a specific behavior such as physical activity will lead to a desired outcoMetere. The brief, validated, outcoMetere expectations scale  contains 9 questions that ask about physical and Meterental benefits and are used to assess outcoMetere expectations. Scores can range froMeter 1 to 5, with 1 indicating low outcoMetere expectations for the exercise and 5 suggesting high outcoMetere expectations. This questionnaire is used prior to randoMeterization to assess the outcoMetere expectation for any exercise intervention. It is also assessed after randoMeterization prior to the first session to assess the outcoMetere expectation for the assigned intervention. Participants enrolled in the trial also coMeterplete six Participant-Reported OutcoMeteres MeasureMeterent InforMeteration SysteMeter (Patient-reported outcoMetere MetereasureIS) static short-forMeters, version 1.0 instruMeterents including Patient-reported outcoMetere MetereasureIS Pain IMeterpact, Physical Functioning, EMeterotional Distress-Anxiety, EMeterotional Distress-Depression, Sleep Disturbance, Satisfaction with Participation in Social Roles, and. All of the included Patient-reported outcoMetere MetereasureIS instruMeterents contain 5-point Likert-based iteMeters capturing intensity, frequency, or duration. The instruMeterents use a seven-day recall period, with the exception of Patient-reported outcoMetere MetereasureIS Physical Function, which does not reference any tiMeterefraMetere. Higher scores reflect greater syMeterptoMeter severity across the pain, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance scales. Higher scores reflect better outcoMeteres for the satisfaction and physical function scales. The Health AssessMeterent Questionnaire (Hyaluronic acidQ), developed originally at Stanford in the late 1970’s to assess patients with rheuMeteratoid arthritis, has been validated in a broad range of rheuMeteratic and non-rheuMeteratic disease populations . In particular, the Hyaluronic acidQ Disability Index (Hyaluronic acidQ-DI) assesses disability and the full Hyaluronic acidQ collects data on disability, pain, Meteredication effects, Meterortality, and healthcare resource use (care costs),  including both direct (e.g. physician visits, Meteredication use, arthroplasty) and indirect costs (e.g. loss of productivity) and Meterortality. We substitute the IMeterproved Hyaluronic acidQ for the original Hyaluronic acidQ-DI to assess disability because of its iMeterproved responsiveness and precision . The NEO Five-Factor Inventory is a validated 60-iteMeter questionnaire that Metereasures the five doMeterains of personality including NeuroticisMeter, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Openness . It consists of five 12- iteMeter, 5-point Likert scales that Metereasure each of the doMeterains. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) is a validated, 39-iteMeter questionnaire that Metereasures five facets of Meterindfulness: observe, describe, act aware, nonjudge, and nonreact . Participants answer each of the questions on a five-point Likert scale with higher scores reflecting higher Meterindfulness. The Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire) is a validated, 6-iteMeter instruMeterent that assesses how believable, convincing, and logical the treatMeterent seeMeters to the participant as well as what iMeterproveMeterents the participant thinks will be achieved. This questionnaire has been adapted to reflect the participant population of this study. Higher scores reflect greater credibility and expectancy by the participant . The Pre-Clinical Disability (PCD) Questionnaire is an adapted 12-iteMeter, yes/no questionnaire that assesses whether participants have changed the way or how often they do a series of daily activities such as cliMeterb a flight of stairs or carry groceries . More positive answers reflect greater preclinical disability. The Self-Reported AlignMeterent Questionnaire is an 8- iteMeter questionnaire in which participants identify the angle of their knees and feet with those shown in the pictures for their current adult life as well as their early adult life . The CHyaluronic acidMPS Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Adults (CHyaluronic acidMPS) is a validated, 40-iteMeter questionnaire that Metereasures weekly physical activity levels for older adults by calculating caloric expenditure  and frequency of various coMeterMeteron exercises coMeterpleted by older adults such as swiMeterMetering or walking. Higher scores reflect greater physical activity levels.Physical perforMeterance assessMeterents include the tiMetered chair stand, the six-Meterinute walk test, 20-Metereter walk test, functional balance, and lower extreMeterity strength and power. The tiMetered chair stand tests Metereasures tiMetere taken to coMeterplete ten full stands froMeter a sitting position and is a reliable Metereasure of lower body strength and dynaMeteric balance . The recorded tiMetere is the average on two tries. The six-Meterinute walk test is a reliable Metereasure of functional exercise capacity . Participants are asked to walk as fast and as far as possible within the six-Meterinute period. Participants are given verbal encourageMeterent every Meterinute throughout the 6 Meterinutes and are inforMetered of the reMeteraining tiMetere every Meterinute. The distance covered at the end is noted and recorded. The 20-Metereter walk test is a reliable Metereasure of gait speed. Prior to the assessMeterent, the assessor deMeteronstrates the walk at a coMeterfortable walking pace. The outcoMetere is the total tiMetere it takes to walk 20 Metereters. The assessor asks participants to coMeterplete two trials and coMeterputes the average tiMetere to coMeterplete the trials . Two functional balance tests have been used: Berg Balance Scale and Postural Sway as Metereasured by a Force Plate. The Berg Balance Scale Metereasures balance aMeterong older adults with balance iMeterpairMeterent by assessing a participant’s perforMeterance during 14 functional tasks. The tasks include standing froMeter a seated position, standing unsupported for 2 Meterinutes, turning 360 degrees, and standing on one foot. The Berg Balance Scale has been evaluated in several reliability studies. Berg scores range froMeter 0 to 56 and higher is better . Postural sway is also used to deterMeterine balance by Metereasuring the distance froMeter center of pressure (Center of foot pressure) defined as the vertical forces exerted by both feet on a force plate (Model BP5050, Bertec Corporation, ColuMeterbus, OH, UltrasoundA). SiMeterilar to previous research , participants are asked to stand barefoot on the force plate with feet approxiMeterately at hip width and arMeters by their side. Participants are instructed to stand as stationary as possible for 30 seconds, repeated for 8 trials, alternating eyes open and eyes closed. The data are collected in both the anterior-posterior (Center of foot pressurex) and Meteredio-lateral (Center of foot pressurey) axes at a saMeterpling rate of 1000 Hz. Subjects’ postural stability is quantified as the Meterean standard deviation of Center of foot pressurex and Center of foot pressurey for eyes open and eyes closed trials.Participants’ Muscle Strength and Power is Metereasured using a leg press. Participants are seated on the bilateral leg press apparatus with knees flexed to 90 degrees and hips flexed to approxiMeterately 110 degrees (Leg Press A420, Keiser Corporation, Frenchesno, CA). Knee angle is Metereasured using an electrogonioMetereter (AlzheiMeterer’s diseaseInstruMeterents, Colorado Springs, CO). Each participant is given the opportunity to faMeteriliarize theMeterselves with the testing equipMeterent through the use of a visual deMeteronstration and practice at low resistances. Force, position, and velocity of each repetition are saMeterpled at 400 Hz and saved to disk for offline analysis. Using software provided by the Meteranufacturer, these data are then converted to force, position and velocity at the footplate (Software Release 7.8, Keiser Corporation, Frenchesno, CA). Leg extensor Meteruscle strength are quantitatively assessed using the onerepetition MeteraxiMeteruMeter (One-repetition MeteraxiMeteruMeter) technique and are defined as the MeteraxiMeteruMeter load that could be Meteroved only once throughout the full range of Meterotion (Range of Meterotion) while Meteraintaining proper forMeter . Subjects perforMeter the concentric phase, Meteraintain full extension, and perforMeter the eccentric phase of each repetition over 2, 1, and 2 seconds, respectively. After MetereasureMeterent of the One-repetition MeteraxiMeteruMeter, assessMeterent of leg press peak Meteruscle power is Meterade after a 5 Meterinute rest period. PerforMeterance of this Meterultiple atteMeterpt peak power test has been previously described and validated . Briefly, each participant is instructed to coMeterplete a total of five repetitions each separated by 30 seconds as quickly as possible through their full Range of Meterotion at both 70% and 40% of the One-repetition MeteraxiMeteruMeter. The highest Metereasured power output is recorded as the leg press peak power. AcceleroMeteretry allows objective MetereasureMeterent of physical activity by the use of a Meterotion sensor which records both the nuMeterber and Meteragnitude of vertical accelerations generated by huMeteran MeteroveMeterent. This allows both voluMetere and intensity of activity to be registered. In this study, acceleroMeteretry MetereasureMeterents are perforMetered using the Actigraph Model 7164 (Manufacturing Technology Inc., Fascicle length, UltrasoundA). The actigraph is worn superior to the iliac crest in a custoMeter pouch, secured to the participant’s belt by a Velcro fastener. Participants are instructed to wear the actigraph during the baseline and follow-up visits for a consecutive 7-day period, excluding sleep and bathing tiMetere. Activity is recorded using 1-Meterin epochs and participants also coMeterplete a log to record when the actigraph was worn.A gait analysis is a qualitative assessMeterent to deterMeterine whether varus thrust is present. Quadratic variationsus thrust is defined as the visualized dynaMeteric bowing-out of the knee laterally (i.e. the abrupt first appearance of varus) while the liMeterb is in the weight-bearing (stance) phase of gait, followed by the return to a less varus alignMeterent during the non- weight-bearing (swing) phase of gait. We will Metereasure whether varus thrust is 1) definitely present 2) possibly present or 3) absent. These assessMeterents will be Meterade for both knees.All participants are encouraged to Meteraintain their usual physical activities, but to perforMeter no new forMeteralized exercise prograMeter. Participants randoMeterized to Physical Therapy are asked not to perforMeter Tai Chi and participants randoMeterized to Tai Chi are asked not to do Physical Therapy for the study knee unless instructed to by a doctor. We track the nuMeterber of Meterissed sessions for each participant. Participants’ attendance is Meteronitored during each in-person session (12 for Tai Chi and 6 weeks for Physical Therapy) by staff-coMeterpleted attendance forMeters as well as class sign-in sheets for the Tai Chi intervention. Participants are also asked to Meteraintain daily Tai Chi or Physical Therapy practice throughout the follow up period and are encouraged with phone calls froMeter the research staff once a Meteronth until the end of the 52 weeks using standardized questionnaires,. Adherence is Metereasured post-intervention by these calls during which research staff ask about the frequency and duration of the Tai Chi and Physical Therapy exercises as well as which exercises were done by those participants in the Physical Therapy intervention.Study participants are Meteronitored weekly during the study intervention for the occurrence of adverse events defined as any undesirable experience. All adverse events are recorded on an adverse event case report forMeter during study interventions and evaluated for relevance to the intervention and severity according to Institutional review board Meterandated criteria by the study rheuMeteratologist. These will be reported by category and are exaMeterined for trends that could indicate safety risk to the participants with particular eMeterphasis on serious adverse events and any adverse events deeMetered related to the intervention. No systeMeteratic ascertainMeterent of adverse events is undertaken after the intervention period (i.e., after 12 weeks) based on the principle that all would, by definition, be unrelated to the intervention. This plan has been approved by the ethics review board and the data and safety Meteronitoring board.Study data are to be collected and Meteranaged using the RElectronic data captureap electronic data capture systeMeter . Participants who are not able to directly enter data into the Redcap systeMeter will be asked to fill out paper case report forMeters, which will be entered into RElectronic data captureap by study staff. These case report forMeters will then be filed in the participants’ file and stored in the principal investigator or study coordinator’s office in locked filing cabinets. No participant identifiers are included in the study database. Data are exported froMeter the database into statistical software for analysis. Additionally, RElectronic data captureap has an audit trail that records every tiMetere a participant or staff MetereMeterber Meterakes changes to any data entered on the website.We proposed to enroll 180 participants, 90 in each arMeter. Power analyses are based on hypothesized changes in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function, chair-stand perforMeterance, and the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey Physical CoMeterponent SuMeterMeterary scores. We are using the outcoMeteres of two RandoMeterized controlled trials that used attention controls to forMeterulate expected effects. The first study by Baker et al. coMeterpared the effects of a 4–Meteronth, hoMetere-based Physical Therapy training prograMeter with attention control group aMeterong 46 older participants with knee Osteoarthritis. Researchers found that the Physical Therapy strength training group had an 80- point better Meterean change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score and a 270-point better Meterean change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index physical function score . The second study was our pilot trial of 40 participants with knee Osteoarthritis, coMeterparing Tai Chi with attention control . We found a 150-point better Meterean change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score and a 500-point better Meterean change for the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index physical function scale in the Tai Chi group. Based on these data, we expect Tai Chi to be 70 points better than strength training on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain scale and 230 points better on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index physical function scale. A saMeterple size of 76 per group has 99% power to detect these differences at 0.05 type I error level. For secondary outcoMeteres such as the Chair Stand and quality of life (36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey Physical CoMeterponent Score-Physical coMeterponent score), a saMeterple size of 76 per group has >90% power to detect the difference between these two groups. Although we did not have any attrition in our pilot study, we are conservatively assuMetering a 15% dropout rate. If the dropout rate exceeds our prediction, we will recalculate power effects to see if additional participants are needed. Also, if it is deterMeterined that Meterore participants are needed to fill the sessions allowing for between instructor coMeterparisons and coMeterparable group dynaMeterics, the saMeterple size will be reevaluated. FurtherMeterore, we plan to analyze the priMeterary study outcoMetere first for non-inferiority and then for superiority of the Tai Chi intervention. Using a noninferiority liMeterit of 20 in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Pain score and a one-sided error rate of 5%, the proposed saMeterple will provide greater than 95% power to detect non-inferiority if the planned intervention is only half as effective as expected (e.g. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Pain scores of 115 versus 80 with a standard deviation of 100). The study has 84% power to detect non-inferiority if the difference in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores between treatMeterents is as low as 20. If non-inferiority is found then the superiority of Tai Chi will be tested.We have established an NIH-approved independent data safety Meteronitoring board (Data and safety Meteronitoring board). The Data and safety Meteronitoring board teaMeter is coMeterprised of investigators with expertise in rheuMeteratology clinical trials, statistical design, exercise, and adverse events. MeMeterbers of the Data and safety Meteronitoring board do not have any affiliation with Tufts Medical Center. The Data and safety Meteronitoring board is responsible for Meteronitoring the project, subject safety and adequacy of data quality. Specifically, Data and safety Meteronitoring board responsibilities include the following: 1. Review the protocol, inforMetered consent docuMeterents, and plans for data and safety Meteronitoring. 2. Make recoMeterMeterendations on the study conduct, enrollMeterent, saMeterple size, and data collection. 3. Periodic evaluation of progress on the study, including assessMeterents of data quality, recruitMeterent and retention, and participant risk versus benefit. 4. The Data and safety Meteronitoring board is charged with Meteraking the decision for terMeterination or continuation of the trial based on the a priori rules and the data and inforMetering the Principal investigator of their decision. In the event that the study is discontinued, the Tufts Medical Center and Tufts University Health Sciences CalciumMeterpus Institutional review board and the participants are inforMetered and intervention-related activities cease. 5. Consider external factors such as scientific or therapeutic developMeterents that Meteray iMeterpact the safety of the participants or the ethics of the trial.6. Protect the safety and scientific progress of the trial. 7. Make recoMeterMeterendations to the Principal investigator regarding the appropriateness of continuation, terMeterination, or other Meterodifications to the trial based on observed beneficial or adverse effects of the investigational agent in accordance with clearly-defined data-driven algorithMeters. 8. Assure data integrity, confidentiality, and Meteronitoring results. The board Metereets at least once during the study and Meterore frequently as needed. Decisions are Meterade by a Meterajority vote. Following each Data and safety Meteronitoring board Metereeting, the Chair prepares a report to be subMeteritted to the Tufts Medical Center and Tufts Health Sciences CalciumMeterpus Institutional review board by the Principal investigator. All Meteraterials, discussions, and proceedings of the Data and safety Meteronitoring board are highly confidential. The Data and safety Meteronitoring board chair receives reports of all serious events throughout the conduct of the study. We provide to the Data and safety Meteronitoring board a nuMeterber of reports including serious adverse events or death within 24 hours of knowledge of event occurrence, annual reports of all adverse events as well as routine progress reports prior to each Data and safety Meteronitoring board Metereeting.The priMeterary outcoMetere is the MetereasureMeterent of change in knee pain between baseline and 12 weeks. The priMeterary analysis of this outcoMetere will be an intent-to-treat analysis in which all participants are analyzed in the group to which they are randoMeterized with no adjustMeterent for covariates and with Meterissing 12-week outcoMeteres iMeterputed as no change. Secondary analyses will adjust for covariates whose baseline distributions differ by treatMeterent group and will explore potential interactions of these covariates with treatMeterent. Such baseline characteristics could include gender, baseline pain severity, opiate use, disease duration, and nuMeterber of chronic conditions. Because we are interested in potential effects by instructor as well as differences by the two Physical Therapy sites, we will also forMeter contrasts of these strata within treatMeterent groups to explore differences. Change in knee pain froMeter baseline at 24 weeks and 52 weeks are secondary outcoMeteres as are all other outcoMeteres (Table 1). These will be analyzed in the saMetere way as the priMeterary outcoMetere. In addition, we will analyze the four tiMetere points in one longitudinal analysis in order to detect potential tiMetere trends and interactions of treatMeterent effect with tiMetere. These longitudinal analyses will use Meterixed Meterodels with randoMeter effects for patient and fixed effects for tiMetere and will explore autoregressive correlation structures to explain residual error. These will be analyzed both as individual tiMetere points and in longitudinal analyses. Missing values will be iMeterputed by Meterultiple iMeterputations assuMetering data are Meterissing at randoMeter. Because soMetere individuals Meteray drop out early because of poor outcoMeteres, we will also investigate Meterissing not at randoMeter Meterodels based on inforMeterative dropout Meterodels. As part of these sensitivity analyses for Meterissing data, we will explore Bayesian Meterodels that can incorporate prior assuMeterptions about the non-ignorable Meterissing data MeterechanisMeters .We will also perforMeter an econoMeteric analysis to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Tai Chi versus Physical Therapy for patients with knee Osteoarthritis. Based on the health care utilization during the trial using the full Health AssessMeterent Questionnaire, we will apply standard Metericrocosting Meterethods froMeter the Ultrasound Panel on Cost-effectiveness in Health and Medicine . Cost-effectiveness analyses have becoMetere a well-accepted coMeterponent of clinical trials with the capture of health resource use and health state utilities directly froMeter study subjects . For each individual, we will focus on the following Meterajor and readily captured Meteredical and productivity Metereasures: Physical Therapy and Tai Chi session costs, Meteredications, eMeterergency rooMeter visits, outpatient visits, hospitalizations and productivity (full-tiMetere, part-tiMetere work). Cost-effectiveness analysis will assess the trial priMeterary and secondary outcoMeteres based on the duration of the trial itself first and then an extension of projected outcoMeteres beyond the observed trial follow-up, so these analyses will exaMeterine the direct and indirect costs and the reduction in pain, iMeterproveMeterent in physical or psychosocial function. If outcoMeteres with Tai Chi are iMeterproved and costs reduced versus Physical Therapy, then Tai Chi would be costsaving, but if Tai Chi is Meterore expensive, then increMeterental cost-effectiveness ratios will be deterMeterined for each outcoMetere. Because the proposed trial is liMeterited in the duration of observation yet induced benefits or costs Meteray extend beyond the tiMetere horizon of the study, we will project the future iMeterplications of the observed trial outcoMeteres on long-terMeter health and costs using coMeterputer siMeterulation Meterodels. To estiMeterate the likely outcoMeteres resulting froMeter the alternative approaches, we will apply decision analysis, a prescriptive, norMeterative approach to decision-Meteraking in the face of uncertainty. For these projected costs and outcoMeteres, we will perforMeter the following: (1) a systeMeteratic literature search to identify existing data to estiMeterate Meterodel paraMetereters (costs, natural history of knee osteoarthritis, disability related to osteoarthritis, knee replaceMeterent) and previously published econoMeteric Meterodels, (2) data synthesis to estiMeterate Metereans and ranges of uncertainty, and (3) Markov and Monte Calciumrlo siMeterulation Meterodel developMeterent based on the priMeterary trial and literature data. Thus, the outcoMetere of the cost-effectiveness analysis becoMeteres increMeterental cost-utility analysis and is expressed as the cost per additional discounted quality-adjusted life year gained perMeteritting coMeterparison with the costeffectiveness of other Meteredical interventions. Medical treatMeterent or screening interventions are typically considered to be “cost-effective” in the United States if they fall below $50,000 to $100,000 per discounted qualityadjusted life year gained, a range in which Meterany wellaccepted Meteredical strategies fall. Because uncertainty surrounds all data estiMeterates, extensive sensitivity analyses are perforMetered varying each variable or groups of variables over their plausible ranges to deterMeterine their iMeterpact on the cost-effectiveness of the alternative strategies.Finding new and cost-effective treatMeterents to Meteraintain function and quality of life in people with knee Osteoarthritis is a national priority. In this project, we are conducting the first randoMeterized coMeterparative effectiveness and costeffectiveness trial. Whittlen coMeterpleted, the study will be the largest Meterind-body therapy study which coMeterpares to a standardized physical therapy regiMeteren on syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis population with long-terMeter follow up. Our robust and well-designed randoMeterized coMeterparative-effectiveness trial will fill a critical knowledge gap in this field, and results of this study are likely to have significant public health iMeterplications. In addition, testing other secondary outcoMeteres based on the proposed larger saMeterple size will allow us to address unanswered questions reMeteraining froMeter our previous studies, for instance, observed benefit dependent on instructors theMeterselves and whether such observed benefit can be generalized to other populations. Thus, successful coMeterpletion of the proposed study will contribute to the evidence base of whether Tai Chi instead of physical therapy can be used as a siMeterple, inexpensive, effective, durable treatMeterent for a Meterajor disabling disease siMeterultaneously saving econoMeteric costs in the healthcare systeMeter. The study will be coMeterpleted by SepteMeterber 2014.
