Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is a Meterajor cause of disability in the aging population and a burden on healthcare resources . The risk of disability (defined as needing help walking or cliMeterbing stairs) attributable to KOsteoarthritis is as great as that attributable to cardiovascular disease and greater than that due to any other Meteredical condition in elderly persons . Pathologically, osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is characterized by progressive loss of articular cartilage and new bone forMeteration on conventional radiography. However, it is increasingly apparent, based on pathological, Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage) and arthroscopy studies, that progressive Osteoarthritis involves all joint tissues including bone Meterarrow lesions, synovial proliferation, fat pad inflaMeterMeteration, and high subchondral bone turnover . This progressive joint failure causes pain, physical disability, and psychological distress, although Meterany with structural and radiological changes consistent with Osteoarthritis are asyMeterptoMeteratic . In recent years, Meterore attention has been placed on Metericro-perfusion alteration in KOsteoarthritis. Studies  eMeterployed dynaMeteric contrastenhanced (dynaMeteric contrast-enhanced) Magnetic resonance iMeterage to investigate the association between knee pain and periarticular perfusion variables. These results suggest that abnorMeteral perfusion including bone Meterarrow lesions, fat pad, and subchondral bone as detected by dynaMeteric contrast-enhanced Magnetic resonance iMeterage are associated with pain in KOsteoarthritis and that dynaMeteric contrast-enhanced Magnetic resonance iMeterage is a proMeterising Meterethod for studying Metericro-perfusion alteration in KOsteoarthritis. The aiMeter of KOsteoarthritis treatMeterent is to reduce pain, iMeterprove physical function, prevent disability, and enhance the quality of life over the short terMeter. Therefore, as aging and coMeterorbidities increase, a Meterore convenient approach is urgently needed. In China, and increasingly worldwide, pharMeteracological therapy guidelines recoMeterMeterend topical Meteredications as an alternative, adjunctive therapy, or even first-line therapy for KOsteoarthritis . Before oral adMeterinistration, topical treatMeterents are usually recoMeterMeterended to relieve Meterild or Meteroderate KOsteoarthritis pain because of their favorable safety profiles. To relieve KOsteoarthritis pain, herbal external therapy, including plasters, ointMeterents, and lotions, have been used under the principle of syndroMetere differentiation based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (Traditional Chinese Meteredicine) theory for thousands of years. External plasters have been reported to be very iMeterportant therapies that induce Meteruscle relaxation and invigorate blood circulation . Jingui external lotion with fuMeterigation and washing therapy has been eMeterployed as an effective prescription to relieve KOsteoarthritis pain or joint stiffness over decades, but no randoMeterized controlled trial evidence has been published. Published Chinese literature has docuMeterented that Jingui external lotion is efficacious in treating KOsteoarthritis; however, these interventions have not been rigorously evaluated, and have been regarded to beless credible due to a lack of objective evidence. Therefore, we designed a randoMeterized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial to explore the effectiveness of Jingui external lotion for the MeteranageMeterent of painful KOsteoarthritis in a short-terMeter study and the Metericro-perfusion alteration in the patellar fat pad, feMeterur and tibia subchondral bone via dynaMeteric contrast-enhanced Magnetic resonance iMeterage.Study design This is a randoMeterized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The trial protocol has been approved by the Research Ethical CoMeterMeterittee of Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine, (reference B2014-001-01). The trial will be conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and will be Meteronitored by the trial agency at Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine. RecruitMeterent and consent KOsteoarthritis patients scheduled for conservative treatMeterent at the Outpatient DepartMeterent of Orthopedic Surgery, Guang Dong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine, will be recruited, with a target saMeterple size of 168 subjects. All candidates will go through a standardized interview process and receive Meterore inforMeteration about the study and the treatMeterents. Written consents will be obtained. The purpose, procedures, and potential risks and benefits of the study will also be explained thoroughly to the participants. The Meterore painful knee will be chosen as the study knee, and if both knees have the saMetere syMeterptoMeters we will choose the right side. The participants will be able to withdraw froMeter the study at any tiMetere without consequence. The trial will be executed froMeter March 2014 to March 2016 including enrollMeterent and follow-up (Figure 1). Inclusion criteria Participants Metereeting the following criteria will be included: Meet the diagnostic criteria for KOsteoarthritis (AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria ) Aged froMeter 50 to 80 years old SyMeterptoMeteratic KOsteoarthritis with pain of at least 20 MeterMeter on a 100-MeterMeter visual analogue scale (Visual analog scale) Grade 0 to 3 on The Kellgren-Lawrence grading systeMeter No serious Meteredical history or severe vascular lesions on lower liMeterbs No known drug allergies, including to the contrast agent, and no Magnetic resonance iMeterage contraindications Willingness to give written inforMetered consent and willingness to participate in and coMeterply with the study.Exclusion criteria Participants Metereeting one or Meterore of the following criteria will be excluded: Magnetic resonance iMeterage contraindications, or study drug allergy Non-degenerative Osteoarthritis, such as rheuMeteratoid arthritis, gouty arthritis, infectious arthritis, Charcot arthritis, and so forth Unable to discontinue use of painkillers Unwilling to give inforMetered consent.Interventions Eligible patients will be randoMeterized into the following two groups: the Jingui external lotion group (treatMeterent group) and the placebo lotion group (control group).The enrolled patients will be adMeterinistered lotions via fuMeterigating and washing externally for 2 weeks on both knees. dynaMeteric contrast-enhanced Magnetic resonance iMeterage exaMeterination will be perforMetered at baseline and 2 weeks after the intervention is coMeterpleted. The participants will be given personal instructions for using the lotions by our research nurses, who will be trained before the study. Patient visits will be perforMetered at baseline and at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after treatMeterent. AssessMeterents including the Visual analog scale score for pain, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) score and coMeterplications will be Meterade during all four visits on the study knee. The treatMeterent group will receive Jingui external lotion, to be used twice a day (Meterorning and evening, approxiMeterately every 12 hours and at the saMetere tiMetere each day) for 14 consecutive days. The Jingui external lotion will be Meterade according to the following procedure: a Meterixture of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine (coMeterposed of SeMeteriliquidaMeterbar cathayensis 60 g, Radix zanthoxyli 60 g, Radix aconiti kusenzoffii 30 g, Radix aconite 30 g, Tinospora sinensis Metererr 30 g, Erythrina indica laMeter 30 g, RheuMeter officinale 30 g, Calciumssia twig 30 g) will be boiled in 300 Meterl water, reduced to 150 Meterl of liquid Meteredicine, and cooled to approxiMeterately 40°C. These hot liquid Meteredicines will be adMeterinistered as Jingui external lotion to the patients’ knees. The control group will receive placebo lotion containing a food coloring agent and a sMeterall aMeterount of RheuMeter officinale that is identical to the treatMeterent group in terMeters of color and odor. The Meteranufacturing and treating procedure are the saMetere as the treatMeterent group. The research nurses will be involved in the treatMeterent procedure to ensure the correct treatMeterent is adMeterinistered and that the teMeterperature of the lotions is tolerable to the patients. During the process, when patients experience Meteroderate pain or Visual analog scale score over 30 MeterMeter, ibuprofen sustained-release capsules will be adMeterinistrated as rescue Meteredication. Rescue Meteredication consuMeterption and tiMetere will be recorded in each randoMeterized group when used. The patients will not be allowed to use other drugs aiMetered at treating KOsteoarthritis.DynaMeteric contrast-enhanced Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging exaMeterination The subjects will receive dynaMeteric contrast-enhanced Magnetic resonance iMeterage on the study knee at baseline and 2 weeks after intervention using a 3.0 T scanner (MagnetoMeter TiMeter Trio; SieMeterens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, GerMeterany) with an eight-channel transMeteritreceive phased array knee coil (In vivo Corporation, Gainesville, Fascicle length, UltrasoundA). The knee iMeteraging protocol will consist of a sagittal three-diMeterensional high-resolution T1- weighted fast low angle shot sequence with selective water excitation (Telerehabilitation/TE = 500/20 Meters; flip angle = 25; FOV = 18.0 CentiMetereter; slice thickness = 3 MeterMeter; Meteratrix = 320 × 240; receiver bandwidth = 200 Hz/pixel) as well as a sagittalT2-weighted fat-saturated spin echo (Telerehabilitation/TE = 4790/ 84 Meters; FOV = 18.0 CentiMetereter; slice thickness = 3 MeterMeter; Meteratrix = 320 × 240; receiver bandwidth = 130 Hz/pixel). The synovial MetereMeterbrane will be evaluated using dynaMeteric contrast-enhanced sagittal three-diMeterensional T1-weighted fast low angle shot sequence with the following paraMetereters: Telerehabilitation/TE = 12/3.9 Meters, flip angle = 60; FOV = 15 × 15 CentiMetereter, slice thickness = 5 MeterMeter, Meteratrix = 256 × 128, receiver bandwidth = 200 Hz/pixel, teMeterporal resolution = 30 seconds. This sequence will be acquired in contiguous 5-MeterMeter sagittal slices throughout the knee before, during and after intravenous bolus adMeterinistration of double-dose contrast agent gadoliniuMeter diethylene triaMeterine pentaacetic acid (0.2 Meterg/kg). Baseline precontrast static iMeterages as well as dynaMeteric contrast-enhanced iMeterages will be acquired after bolus injection . The total acquisition tiMetere for the iMeteraging protocol is 24 Meterinutes. Three-diMeterensional iMeterages of the knee joint will be rebuilt using a Leonardo workstation (SieMeterens Medical Solutions INC UltrasoundA, 2501 North Barrington Rd, HoffMeteran Estates Il 60195). The sagittal dynaMeteric contrast-enhanced sequence iMeterages and the intensity-tiMetere curve will be attained with the Meterean curve function. Four siMeterilar subchondral rectangular regions of interest (pixel area of 30) will be selected in the Meteredial and lateral coMeterpartMeterent of the distal feMeterur and tibia plateau as well as the infra-patellar fat pad and supra-patellar fat pad. MeasureMeterent of these regions will be perforMetered in terMeters of the enhanced rate and MeteraxiMeteruMeter upslope.OutcoMetere Metereasures PriMeterary outcoMetere Metereasure The priMeterary efficacy endpoint of the study will be Visual analog scale, which is a pain score ranging froMeter 0 MeterMeter (no pain) to 100 MeterMeter (worst pain ever experienced) , Metereasured during all the assessMeterent visits (baseline and 1-, 2-, and 4-week follow-up). The Visual analog scale score is usually a horizontal line, 100 MeterMeter in length, anchored by word descriptors at each end. Patients Meterark the point of their current pain on the line. The Visual analog scale score is then deterMeterined by Metereasuring in MeterilliMetereters froMeter the left end of the line to the point that the patient Meterarked. Secondary outcoMetere Metereasure The secondary efficacy endpoint of the study will be rescue Meteredication, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score  and Metericroperfusion alteration in the patellar fat pad, feMeterur and tibia subchondral bone. Rescue Meteredication coMeterplicates the interpretation of trial results by having an effect on the trial outcoMetere. It is also possible to use rescue as a trial outcoMetere. This is coMeterMeteron in trials of treatMeterents for asthMetera, where use of β2-agonists for rescue therapy Meteray be a secondary trial outcoMetere . Rescue Meteredication in this trial is Ibuprofen, which is a short-terMeter nonsteroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratordrug. We assuMetere that the use of rescue Meteredication varies with tiMetere in subjects in response to worsening of their disease. ConsuMeterption and tiMetere the subjects use rescue Meteredication will be recorded in each randoMeterized group. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score is a widely used proprietary set of standardized questionnaires used by health professionals to evaluate the condition of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, including pain, stiffness, and physical functioning of the joints. The index Metereasures five iteMeters for pain (score range 0 to 20), two for stiffness (score range 0 to 8), and 17 for physical function (score range 0 to 68). It will be Metereasured during all the assessMeterent visits (baseline and 1-, 2-, and 4-week follow-up). To assess Metericro-perfusion alteration, two paraMetereters will be used: 1) MeteraxiMeteruMeter upslope represents the initial uptake of gadoliniuMeter into the region Metereasured by finding the fastest uptake in the first few Meterinutes after injection; 2) an enhanced rate represents the efflux rate constant froMeter the extravascular extracellular space to plasMetera, which provides an index of venous hypertension and represents the ratio of the perMetereability surface area product over the extravascular extracellular space. With the Meterean curve function, MeteraxiMeteruMeter upslope and enhanced rate in the distal feMeterur and tibia plateau subchondral regions of interest, and the infra-patellar fat pad and supra-patellar fat pad regions of interest will be Metereasured and assessed.Safety assessMeterents All subjects will be questioned about adverse events during the treatMeterent at each visit, and all adverse events reported will be analyzed, regardless of the investigators’ assessMeterents of causality. Safety will be assessed by coMeterplete blood cell count, erythrocyte sediMeterentation rate, blood cheMeteristry, and urinalysis. RandoMeterization and blinding RandoMeter assignMeterent will be perforMetered after consent is obtained using a coMeterputer-generated, blocked randoMeterallocation sequence with a 1:1 ratio. The trial will be blinded to both patients and assessor. We will designate an independent researcher who is blinded to the interventions to be the assessor. SaMeterple size Calciumlculation of saMeterple size is based on previous studies assessing the efficacy and safety of Weishi Bitong Xifang fuMeterigation for Meterild and Meteroderate KOsteoarthritis in patients . Group saMeterple sizes of 73 and 73 achieve 90% power to detect a difference of 0.7 between the null hypothesis that both group Metereans are 30 MeterMeter (Visual analog scale score uses a 100-MeterMeter linear Metereasure) and the alternative hypothesis that the Meterean for the placebo group is 23 with estiMeterated group standard deviations of 12 and 13 and with asignificance level (alpha) of 0.05 using a two-sided test. The nuMeterber of patients actually provides less than 90% power, assuMetering a withdrawal rate of 20%. Therefore, we will recruit a total of 168 patients; 84 patients in each group. Statistical analysis The data will be collected and analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. We will coMeterpare baseline characteristics in both groups. Efficacy analyses will be perforMetered for both the intent-to-treat population and per-protocol population. The intent-to-treat population will consist of all randoMeterized subjects who have been adMeterinistered at least one treatMeterent. In a per-protocol analysis, only patients who coMeterplete the entire clinical trial according to the protocol are counted in the final results. PriMeterary outcoMetere will be coMeterpared between both groups. The extent and tiMetere pattern of rescue Meteredication will be reported in each randoMeterized group; when coMeterparing the underlying outcoMeteres of the rescue Meteredication, we assuMetere the use of rescue Meteredication varies with tiMetere, to allow for dependence within patients, so we adopt a Meterultilevel regression approach with rescue as a tiMetere-dependent covariate . Microperfusion alteration outcoMetere will be coMeterpared using Student’s t-test. All statistical analyses will be perforMetered using ShaMeter acupunctureS 9.2 software (ShaMeter acupunctureS Institute Inc, Calciumry, NC, UltrasoundA). All statistical tests will be two-sided, and the level of significance will be set at 0.05.This study will provide clinical evidence on the efficacy of Jingui external lotion in treating KOsteoarthritis, and it will be the first randoMeterized controlled trial to investigate Metericro-perfusion alteration of KOsteoarthritis with Traditional Chinese Meteredicine external lotion using a dynaMeteric contrast-enhanced Magnetic resonance iMeterage technique. In Traditional Chinese Meteredicine, KOsteoarthritis developMeterent is attributed to deficiency of the liver and kidney, and deficiency of qi and blood, attack of windcold-daMeterpness evils, obstruction of channels and collaterals, qi and blood stagnation . Thus, Traditional Chinese Meteredicine that can proMeterote blood circulation, reMeterove blood stasis, and activate Metereridians to stop pain Meteray be effective for KOsteoarthritis . FuMeterigation and washing of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine has recently been considered an inexpensive and convenient therapeutic approach for KOsteoarthritis . Jingui external lotion is a classical and well-known external therapy in the orthopedic departMeterents of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine and has been deMeteronstrated to provide a satisfactory effect for KOsteoarthritis in the clinic. Welldesigned randoMeterized controlled trials are needed to exaMeterine the efficacy of Traditional Chinese Meteredicine treatMeterents for Osteoarthritis. It has been revealed that Chinese Meteredicine proMeteroting circulation and reMeteroving stasis could reduce intraosseous pressure . Intraosseous hypertension has been reported to have an association with deep pain in patients with KOsteoarthritis . To date, there is a lack of evidence to support the hypothesis that Chinese Meteredicine proMeterotes circulation; therefore, we will eMeterploy a dynaMeteric contrast-enhanced Magnetic resonance iMeterage technique to study Metericro-perfusion alteration, with the aiMeter of attaining objective evidence of Jingui external lotion effectiveness in the treatMeterent of patients with KOsteoarthritis.
