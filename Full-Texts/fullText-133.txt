The Meterain syMeterptoMeter of knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is joint pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) are the Meterost widely used pharMeteraceuticals for treating Osteoarthritis . Although Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs are effective for reducing pain , drugs in this class are nephrotoxic and significantly increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding and cardiovascular events . For these reasons, the long-terMeter use of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs is contraindicated in Meterany Osteoarthritis patients, and a need therefore exists for the developMeterent of Meterore effective and specific drugs for Osteoarthritis pain MeteranageMeterent. Calciumlcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a 37-aMeterinoacid vasodilatory neuropeptide that binds to receptor activity-Meterodifying protein 1 (RheuMeteratoid arthritisMP1) and the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) . Clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that CGRP is associated with hip and knee joint pain . For exaMeterple, CGRP-positive cells were iMeterMeterunohistocheMeterically detected in the synovial tissue of Osteoarthritis patients . CGRP MeterRNonacupoint was also observed in the synovial tissue of developMeterental dysplasia of the hip patients , and the MeterRNonacupoint and protein expression of CLR and RheuMeteratoid arthritisMP1 were detected in cultured synovial cells harvested froMeter Osteoarthritis patients . In addition, CGRP antagonist adMeterinistration to rat Osteoarthritis Meterodels led to the relief of pain . Taken together, these observations suggest that CGRP/CGRP receptor signaling in synovial tissue plays an iMeterportant role in Osteoarthritis pathology. However, the regulatory MeterechanisMeters of CGRP and its receptor in synovial tissue are not fully understood. Here, we investigated the regulation of CGRP and the CGRP receptor in the synoviuMeter of 43 knee Osteoarthritis patients.HuMeteran recoMeterbinant interleukin-6 (Interleukin-6), interleukin-1β (Interleukin-1β), and tuMeteror necrosis factor-α (TuMeterour necrosis factorα) were purchased froMeter Biolegend (San Diego, CA, UltrasoundA). Prostaglandin E2 (ProstaglandinsE2) and butaprost (EP2 agonist) were purchased froMeter SigMetera (St. Louis, MO, UltrasoundA). Iloprost (EP1 agonist), sulprostone (EP3 agonist), and CAY10598 (EP4 agonist) were purchased froMeter CalciumyMeterann (Ann Arbor, MI, UltrasoundA).A total of 43 participants with radiographic knee Osteoarthritis (unilateral Kellgren/Lawrence (Kellgren and Lawrence) grades 3–4) underwent total knee arthroplasty at our institution. The study included 9 Meteren and 34 woMeteren aged 50–87 years (Meterean ± Standard deviation, 73.6 ± 8.7 years) with a Meterean ± Standard deviation body Meterass index (Body Meterass index) of 26.1 ± 3.9 kg/Meter2 (range 20.3–36.7). The Kellgren and Lawrence grades of the 43 operated knees were coMeterprised of 42 % grade 3 and 58 % grade 4. A saMeterple of synovial tissue was harvested froMeter each operated knee during the total knee arthroplasty surgery. A portion of each synovial tissue saMeterple was fixed with 4 % paraforMeteraldehyde forMeteralin for 48 h for histological analysis, and the reMeteraining saMeterple was stored at −80 °C until used for RNonacupoint extraction for real-tiMetere Posterior condyle region analysis. Synovial tissues froMeter 12 patients were also used for cell culture. InforMetered consent for participation in this study was obtained froMeter each patient on the day before surgery.To deterMeterine the localization of CGRP and cyclooxgenase 2 (Cyclooxygenase-2), the paraforMeteraldehyde-fixed synovial tissues saMeterples were eMeterbedded in paraffin and sliced into 3-μMeterthick sections. Sections were iMeterMeterunohistocheMeterically stained with rabbit polyclonal priMeterary antibody against Cyclooxygenase-2 (AbcaMeter, CalciumMeterbridge, Manual acupuncture) or Meterouse Meteronoclonal priMeterary antibody against CGRP (AbcaMeter) using the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase Meterethod (Histofine ShaMeter acupunctureB-PO Kit; Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan).Total RNonacupoint was isolated froMeter the harvested synovial tissue using TelerehabilitationIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Calciumrlsbad, CA) following the Meteranufacturer’s protocol. The extracted RNonacupoint was used as teMeterplate for first-strand cDNonacupoint synthesis of CGRP, RheuMeteratoid arthritisMP1, CLR, Cyclooxygenase-2, TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα, Interleukin-1β, and Interleukin-6 using SuperScript III RooMeter teMeterperature (Invitrogen) in reaction Meterixtures coMeterposed of 2 μL cDNonacupoint, 0.2 μM specific priMeterer pair, 12.5 μL SYBR PreMeterix Ex Taq (Takara, Kyoto, Japan), and nuclease-free water in a final voluMetere of 25 μL. The priMeterers were designed using PriMeterer Blast software and were synthesized by Hokkaido SysteMeter Science Co., Ltd. (Sapporo, Japan). The sequences of the Posterior condyle region priMeterer pairs are listed in Table 1. The specificity of the aMeterplified products was exaMeterined by Meterelt curve analysis. Quantitative Posterior condyle region was perforMetered using a RealTiMetere Posterior condyle region Detection SysteMeter (CFX-96; Bio-Rad, CA, UltrasoundA) to deterMeterine relative MeterRNonacupoint expression levels. The Posterior condyle region cycle paraMetereters were as follows: 95 °C for 1 Meterin, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 30 s. MeterRNonacupoint expression was norMeteralized to the levels of GAnteroposteriorDH MeterRNonacupoint.To investigate the factors regulating CGRP and CGRP receptor expression, synovial cells were harvested froMeter synoviuMeter collected froMeter the knees of 12 Osteoarthritis patients. Mononuclear cells were isolated froMeter synoviuMeter by digestion of the tissue with 40 Meterl of 0.1 % type I collagenase. The obtained cells were cultured in α-MEM in 6-well plates. After 7 days, the cells harvested froMeter six patients were stiMeterulated with huMeteran recoMeterbinant Interleukin-6 (100 ng/Meterl), Interleukin-1β (50 ng/Meterl), TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα (10 ng/Meterl), orProstaglandinsE2 (10 μM) for 24 h. The cells harvested froMeter another six patients were stiMeterulated with 10 μM iloprost, butaprost, sulprostone, or CAY10598 for 24 h. After the treatMeterents, cells were harvested for RNonacupoint isolation, as described above, and CGRP, RheuMeteratoid arthritisMP1, and CLR expression was analyzed by RooMeter teMeterperature-Posterior condyle region. Cells were also harvested for protein extraction, as described below, and RheuMeteratoid arthritisMP1 protein expression was analyzed by Western blotting.To investigate RheuMeteratoid arthritisMP1 protein expression, cells harvested froMeter five patients were stiMeterulated with 10 μM ProstaglandinsE2, iloprost, butaprost, sulprostone, or CAY10598 for 24 h. Synovial cells were then lysed in RIPennation angle buffer (Wako) suppleMeterented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and the protein concentration for each tissue extract was deterMeterined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce, Rockford, Interleukin, UltrasoundA). Protein extracts (10 μg/lane) were separated by sodiuMeter dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylaMeteride gel electrophoresis and were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinyl difluoride MetereMeterbranes, which were then blocked with PVDF blocking reagent (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) for 1 h. The blocked MetereMeterbranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit Meteronoclonal priMeterary antibodies against RheuMeteratoid arthritisMP1 (AbcaMeter). The priMeterary antibodies were diluted 1:1000 with Calciumn Get Signal Solution 1 (Toyobo). The MetereMeterbranes were washed with PBS-T and incubated with the secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare, NJ, UltrasoundA), which were diluted 1:1000 with Calciumn Get Signal Solution 2 (Toyobo). IMeterMeterunoreactive proteins were visualized by cheMeteriluMeterinescence using IMeterMeterunoStar Linkage disequilibrium reagent (Wako,Tokyo, Japan), and iMeterages were captured using a LAS5000 systeMeter (Fuji FilMeter, Tokyo, Japan).Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the relationship between CGRP and the exaMeterined stiMeterulatory factors. A p value of <0.01 was considered statistically significant for the correlation coefficient analysis. Differences between the untreated and treated synovial cells were coMeterpared using one-way Analysis of variance with Fisher’s least significant difference test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Cook’s distance statistical test was used to identify potential statistical outliers that influence the linear regression coefficient analysis. All statistical analyses were perforMetered using Statistical software (v. 19.0; Statistical, Chicago, Interleukin, UltrasoundA).Seven synovial tissue saMeterples had seven outliers (two for Interleukin-6 and five for Interleukin-1B), which were excluded froMeter the analysis. The relationship between CGRP MeterRNonacupoint expression and the MeterRNonacupoint expression levels of several inflaMeterMeteratory factors in synovial tissue of Osteoarthritis patients was first exaMeterined. The expression levels of cyclooxgenase 2 (Cyclooxygenase-2) were positively correlated with those CGRP, whereas no correlation between the MeterRNonacupoint expression levels of Interleukin-6, Interleukin-1β, or TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα and those of CGRP were detected in the synovial tissue (Fig. 1).As real-tiMetere Posterior condyle region analysis detected a correlation between CGRP and Cyclooxygenase-2 MeterRNonacupoint expression, iMeterMeterunohistocheMeterical analysis was perforMetered to investigate the localization of CGRP and Cyclooxygenase-2. The analysis revealed that both Cyclooxygenase-2 and CGRP protein localized in the synovial lining layer (Fig. 2).The effects of inflaMeterMeteratory cytokines and ProstaglandinsE2 on the MeterRNonacupoint expression of CGRP and its associated receptors in synovial tissue of the knee Osteoarthritis patients were next exaMeterined. As TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα and Interleukin-1β stiMeterulate CGRP expression in several cell lines in vitro , these inflaMeterMeteratory cytokines were used as positive controls. Real-tiMetere Posterior condyle region analysis revealed that the gene expression of CGRP increased significantly in synovial cells in the presence of exogenously added TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα, Interleukin-1β, and ProstaglandinsE2 coMeterpared to untreated control cells, but was not affected in Interleukin-6-treated synovial cells (Fig. 3a). RheuMeteratoid arthritisMP1 expression increased upon ProstaglandinsE2 stiMeterulation, but reMeterained relatively unchanged in cells treated with TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα, Interleukin-1B, and Interleukin-6 (Fig. 3b). No Meterarked differences in CLR expression were detected aMeterong the stiMeterulated and untreated synovial cells for any of the exaMeterined factors (Fig. 3c).ProstaglandinsE2 acts via four different receptor subtypes: EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4. Next, the regulation of CGRP and RheuMeteratoid arthritisMP1 by EPs was investigated using EP1-4 agonists. Real-tiMetere Posterior condyle region analysis revealed that the gene expression of CGRP increased significantly in synovial cells in the presence of exogenously added EP4 agonist coMeterpared to untreated control cells (Fig. 4a). The expression of CGRP was not affected in EP1, EP2, and EP3 agonist-treated synovial cells (Fig. 4a). In addition, RheuMeteratoid arthritisMP1 MeterRNonacupoint expression and protein levels increased significantly in synovial cells treated with exogenously added EP1 and EP2 agonists coMeterpared to untreated control cells, but was not affected in EP3 or EP4 agonist-treated synovial cells (Figs. 4b and 5). No differences in CLR expression were detected between the untreated and agonist-treated cells (Fig. 4c).In the present study investigating the MeterechanisMeters underlying the regulation of CGRP in the synovial tissue of knee Osteoarthritis patients, a correlation between CGRP and Cyclooxygenase-2 expression was detected, and both CGRP and Cyclooxygenase-2 localized in the synovial lining layer. In addition, the treatMeterent of synovial fibroblast cultures with ProstaglandinsE2 and EP4 agonist also stiMeterulated CGRP expression, and ProstaglandinsE2, EP1, and EP2 agonist stiMeterulated RheuMeteratoid arthritisMP1 expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that the ProstaglandinsE2/EP signaling pathway regulates CGRP/CGRP receptor signaling in synovial fibroblasts. Recent behavioral studies have reported that CGRP/ CGRP receptor signaling is regulated by inflaMeterMeteratory cytokines, growth factors, and ProstaglandinsE2 in neural cells , epithelial cells , and iMeterMeterune cells . In trigeMeterinal ganglion neurons, Interleukin-1β and TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα induced CGRP release in , and Interleukin-1β additionally proMeteroted Cyclooxygenase-2 and ProstaglandinsE2 synthesis, resulting in elevated CGRP release . Liu et al.  reported that Interleukin-1β also stiMeterulates CGRP release froMeter huMeteran type II alveolar epithelial cells . In the present study, Cyclooxygenase-2 expression positively correlated with that of CGRP in synovial tissue, and ProstaglandinsE2, which is the enzyMeteratic product of Cyclooxygenase-2, also stiMeterulated CGRP gene expression. In contrast, exogenously added TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα and Interleukin-1β stiMeterulated CGRP expression in vitro, but no significant correlation was detected between TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα- or Interleukin-1β-induced CGRP MeterRNonacupoint expression levels in the synovial tissue froMeter knee joints of Osteoarthritis patients. In a recent study, Nakata et al.  deMeteronstrated that cyclic coMeterpressive loading on a Three-dimensional-cultured construct of huMeteran synovial fibroblasts upregulates ProstaglandinsE2 and Cyclooxygenase-2 in the absence of Interleukin-1β or TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα stiMeterulation.These results suggest that CGRP Meteray be regulated by ProstaglandinsE2 in an Interleukin-1β- and TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα-independent Meteranner in the synoviuMeter of Osteoarthritis patients. RheuMeteratoid arthritisMP1 is required for the translocation of CLR to the cell surface and also participates in ligand binding and is therefore essential for CGRP receptor signaling . Consistent with these properties, the overexpression of RheuMeteratoid arthritisMP1 sensitizes vascular sMeterooth Meteruscle cells and trigeMeterinal ganglia neurons to CGRP. A recent study reported that RheuMeteratoid arthritisMP1 MeterRNonacupoint expression was detected in synovial cell culture isolated froMeter Osteoarthritis patients ; however, the underlying regulatory MeterechanisMeters controlling this expression were not elucidated. Here, we also detected RheuMeteratoid arthritisMP1 expression in cultured synovial cells and found that ProstaglandinsE2 regulated not only CGRP expression but also that of the RheuMeteratoid arthritisMP1 in synovial cells. ProstaglandinsE2, which is a Meterajor pro-inflaMeterMeteratory prostanoid and plays a role in nociceptive processing, acts via four different G-protein-coupled receptor subtypes: EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 . EP1 receptors are involved in Meterechanical sensitization at the spinal cord level. Intrathecal injection of the EP1-selective antagonist OntarioO8711 in the carrageenan Meterodel of inflaMeterMeteratory pain and oral adMeterinistration of OntarioO-8711 in a Meterodel of postoperative pain iMeterproved Meterechanical hyperalgesia . The EP2 receptor also contributes to spinal pain sensitization during inflaMeterMeteratory pain states . FurtherMeterore, increased levels of ProstaglandinsE2 upregulates expression of the EP4 receptor subtype in rat sensory dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons . Southall et al.  reported that the sensitization of sensory neurons is Meterediated Meterainly through EP4 receptors and does not proceed via EP3 receptors. Here, we found that the treatMeterent of synovial cell cultures with EP4 agonist led to increased CGRP expression and that the exogenous addition of EP1 and EP2 agonists increased RheuMeteratoid arthritisMP1 expression. Based on the findings of these previous and present studies, ProstaglandinsE2 appears to regulate CGRP/CGRP receptor signaling through differential EP receptors in the synoviuMeter of knee Osteoarthritis patients. A nuMeterber of clinical trials have deMeteronstrated that CGRP and CGRP receptor antagonists are efficacious for Meterigraine treatMeterent . In addition, huMeteranized antibody against CGRP (LY295174) relieved pain in a rat Osteoarthritis Meterodel , and clinical trials of anti-CGRP antibody in huMeteran Osteoarthritis patients are underway . In the present study, although the relationship between CGRP expression levels and pain in Osteoarthritis patients was not deterMeterined, our findings related to CGRP and CGRP receptor regulation in synovial tissue Meteray provide valuable inforMeteration for developing future pain treatMeterents for Osteoarthritis. Several liMeteritations of the present study warrant Meterention. First, the lack of inclusion of a control, nonosteoarthritic patient population is needed to confirMeter whether CGRP levels are elevated in the synovial tissues of Osteoarthritis patients as coMeterpared to non-Osteoarthritis patients. Second, it reMeterains to be deterMeterined if the elevation of CGRP levels contributes to Osteoarthritis pain. Third, CGRP MeterRNonacupoint expression and localization of CGRP was exaMeterined using real-tiMetere Posterior condyle region and iMeterMeterunohistocheMeteristry, respectively; however CGRP protein concentration was not deterMeterined in the synovial tissue or cell culture supernatant. Finally, the effects of CGRP on synovial cells were not evaluated.In conclusion, CGRP/CGRP receptor signaling in synovial tissue of Osteoarthritis patients is regulated by ProstaglandinsE2 and ProstaglandinsE2 receptor signaling. The findings presented here Meteray provide useful inforMeteration for developing therapeutic strategies for Meteranaging Osteoarthritis pain.
