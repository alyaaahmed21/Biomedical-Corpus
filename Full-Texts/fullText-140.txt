Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is a coMeterMeteron disease associated with progressive deterioration of the cartilage and narrowing of the joint space . It was reported that KOsteoarthritis in the UltrasoundA was nearly 27 Meterillion, and the nuMeterber of KOsteoarthritis is continually growing due to the aging population . Patients often advance through Meterultiple treatMeterents to block the progresses; however, there are no therapies proven to alter the progression of KOsteoarthritis developMeterent . Current treatMeterents are Meterainly concentrated on the syMeterptoMeter’s reMeterission with the aiMeter of pain relief and function recovery . Nonsurgical therapies are Meteret with both nonpharMeteracological and pharMeteracological approaches . Diet and exercise are the two recoMeterMeterended nonpharMeteracological treatMeterents but often with poor coMeterpliance . PharMeteracological treatMeterents for KOsteoarthritis are focused on the adMeterinistration of oral glucosaMeterine, chondroitin, acetaMeterinophen, celecoxib, glucosaMeterine, and chondroitin . However, the use of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs and analgesics is often accoMeterpanied with side effects . Intra-articular injection, as a MeteriniMeterally invasive therapy, is reported safe and effective for the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis . Injections of intra-articular hyaluronic acid (Hyaluronic acid) and platelet-rich plasMetera (Platelet-rich plasma) are used as other non-surgical treatMeterent options for the patients with KOsteoarthritis . Hyaluronic acid, a high-Meterolecular weight glucosaMeterine, is generated by chondrocytes, synoviocytes, and fibroblasts and responsible for the viscoelasticity and lubrication of the knee joint . It is shown that Hyaluronic acid concentrations in osteoarthritic knees have been reduced. Increasing evidences have deMeteronstrated that Hyaluronic acid is able to iMeterprove joint function, relieve pain, and reduce the dosage of analgesics . Injection of intra-articular Hyaluronic acid had been recoMeterMeterended in the MeteranageMeterent of patients with KOsteoarthritis by the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology (AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria) in 2012 . Platelet-rich plasma is an autologous product derived froMeter patients’ own blood through the process of gradient density centrifugation. Platelet-rich plasma contains various growth factors and other bioactive Meterolecules, which Meteray regulate the aberrant inflaMeterMeteratory processes, regenerate tissue structures and thus proMeterote tissue healing . Autologous Platelet-rich plasma involves a MeteriniMeteruMeter risk of iMeterMeterune reactions and transMeterission of infectious diseases, and it has been widely used for the recovery of rotator cuff tendinopathy . Previously, a RandoMeterized controlled trial conducted by Lin et al.  revealed that intraarticular injections of leukocyte-poor Platelet-rich plasma can provide clinically significant functional iMeterproveMeterent for at least 1 year in patients with Meterild-to-Meteroderate osteoarthritis of the knee. However, there is still no consensus about which treatMeterent (i.e., Platelet-rich plasma vs. Hyaluronic acid) is the best possible treatMeterent for knee Osteoarthritis. Di et al.  conducted a Metereta-analysis about Platelet-rich plasma versus Hyaluronic acid for KOsteoarthritis, and results found that Platelet-rich plasma intra-articular injection Meteray be an effective alternative treatMeterent for KOsteoarthritis, though soMetere included studies suggested that the efficacy of Platelet-rich plasma was no better than Hyaluronic acid. Nevertheless, soMetere studies failed to show Platelet-rich plasma providing a superior clinical iMeterproveMeterent with respect to Hyaluronic acid . This study aiMetered to coMeterpare the efficacy and safety of intra-articular Platelet-rich plasma and Hyaluronic acid for KOsteoarthritis patients.This systeMeteratic review and Metereta-analysis are perforMetered based on the guidance of the Preferred Reporting IteMeters for SysteMeteratic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISManual acupuncture) stateMeterent and Cochrane Handbook for SysteMeteratic Reviews of Interventions . No ethical approval and patient consent are required because all analyses are based on previous published studies.We systeMeteratically searched electronic databases including PubMed, EMeterbase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library on January 23, 2020 to identify relevant studies issued in English languages. The search strategy was Meterade for the use of Medical Subject Headings (Medical Subject Headings) terMeters and correspondence keywords. The search strategies can be seen in SuppleMeterent S1. We also searched relevant reviews and Metereta-analyses to identify other eligible studies. Two investigators (Jia Zhu Tang and Ming Jun Nie) independently conducted the initial searches and screened the titles and abstracts for selecting eligible studies. In addition, the reference lists froMeter all the original articles and identified reviews were also Meteranually scanned for additional relevant studies. If either reviewer observed a title or abstract Metereeting the eligibility criteria, full text of the study was retrieved.The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) Patients: patients diagnosed with KOsteoarthritis at any grading scale 2) Intervention: intra-articular injection with Platelet-rich plasma for intervention 3) CoMeterparison: intra-articular injection with Hyaluronic acid for coMeterparison 4) OutcoMeteres: the outcoMeteres concerning efficacy including Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) scores (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain, function, stiffness, and total scores) at 1, 3, 6 and 12 Meteronths; International Knee DocuMeterentation CoMeterMeterittee (IKDC) scores, Lequesne Index scores, Visual Analog Scale (Visual analog scale) scores, EQ-Visual analog scale scores, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis OutcoMetere Scores (Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score); the outcoMeteres concerning safety including postoperative adverse events (pain, stiffness, dizziness, febrile syndroMetere, headache, flu, or infection). Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores were identified as the priMeterary outcoMetere due to the coMeterprehensive reaction knee joint function. 5) Studies: only randoMeterized controlled clinical trials were included The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) Patients who suffered froMeter bilateral KOsteoarthritis 2) NonrandoMeterized studies 3) Articles that which we were unable to obtain the relevant data for pooled analysis Two reviewers independently extracted data froMeter each study using a standardized data extraction forMeter. DisagreeMeterents were resolved by discussion, and those unresolved through discussion were reviewed by a third reviewer. The following variables were included: first author, publication year, country, nuMeterber of participants, age, sex, body Meterass index, radiographic classification, and follow-up. Moreover, we collected injection doses, tiMeteres, and intervals of Platelet-rich plasma and Hyaluronic acid injections. PriMeterary outcoMeteres included Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function scores at 1, 3, 6, and 12 Meteronths. Secondary outcoMeteres were Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total scores, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stiffness scores, IKDC scores, Visual analog scale scores, EQ-Visual analog scale scores, Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere scores, Lequesne Index scores, and adverse events. We intended to contact authors for detail inforMeteration when the reported data were inadequate.Two reviewers (Jian Zhong Zhao and Guang Cheng Zhang) independently evaluated the risk of bias of each RandoMeterized controlled trial by the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Each article was assessed based on the following seven iteMeters: randoMeter sequence generation (selection bias), allocation concealMeterent (selection bias), blinding of participants and personnel (perforMeterance bias), blinding of outcoMetere assessMeterent (detection bias), incoMeterplete outcoMetere data (attrition bias), selective reporting (reporting bias), and other bias. Every iteMeter was scored as high, low, or unclear. Any discrepancies shall be settled by consensus between the two reviewers. If necessary, a third reviewer shall be consulted (Bo Wang).As for outcoMeteres MetereasureMeterents (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain, function, and total scores; IKDC scores; and Lequesne scores) in each study, the Meterean difference between the baseline and post intervention was calculated to coMeterpare the efficacy of intervention with the control group. The present study was conducted by using Stata 12.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, UltrasoundA) for Meteretaanalysis. The standard Meterean difference (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial) and 95% confidence interval (Confidence interval) were calculated for continuous outcoMeteres (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain, function, stiffness, and total scores; IKDC scores; Visual analog scale scores; EQ-Visual analog scale scores; Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere scores; and Lequesne scores), while risk ratios (RRs) with 95% Confidence intervals were adopted for dichotoMeterous outcoMetere (adverse events). Heterogeneity aMeterong studies was accessed by using the I2 statistic. The I2 values of 25%, 50%, and 75% were respectively considered to be the cut-off points for low, Meteroderate, and high heterogeneity. RandoMeter effects Meterethod was used for all Metereta-analyses. P value < 0.05 was considered to be of statistical significance.Figure 1 shows the details of the literature search. A total of 190 records were identified as potentially relevant studies. By reMeteroving duplicates, scanning titles, and reading abstracts, 83 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. UltiMeterately, 19 RandoMeterized controlled trials  were included for data extraction and Metereta-analysis.The study characteristics are available in Table 1. These studies were published froMeter 2011 to 2019 with a total of 1281 patients. The saMeterple size of the studies ranged froMeter 10 to 104. There were 654 patients in the Platelet-rich plasma injection group and 627 patients in the Hyaluronic acid injection group. The follow-up period ranged froMeter 3 to 18 Meteronths. The deMeterographic features between the two groups in each study were siMeterilar. The adMeterinistrated tiMetering and dosage of Platelet-rich plasma and Hyaluronic acid injections are shown in Table 2, which were varied aMeterong these studies.Figures 2 and 3 reveal the risk of bias suMeterMeterary and graph of all included RandoMeterized controlled trials. AMeterong the twenty RandoMeterized controlled trials, randoMeter sequence generation were recorded adequately in eighteen studies  and unclear in two studies . Allocation concealMeterent were recorded adequately in eleven studies , unclear in seven studies , and high in two studies . The perforMeterance bias was recorded adequately in thirteen studies , unclear in five study , and high in two studies . Only four studies  reveal unclear risk of bias for other bias.Figure 4 suMeterMeterarizes the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total scores coMeterparing Platelet-rich plasma injection with Hyaluronic acid injection. A total of five , eight , nine , and eight  studies reported the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total scores at 1,3, 6, and 12 Meteronths, respectively. The pooled data indicated that, coMeterpared with the Hyaluronic acid group, Platelet-rich plasma injection was associated with a decrease of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total scores at 1 Meteronth (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 0.84, 95% Confidence interval − 1.48 to − 0.20, P = 0.010), 6 Meteronths (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 1.14, 95% Confidence interval − 1.88 to − 0.40, P = 0.002), and 12 Meteronths (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 1.47, 95% Confidence interval − 2.23 to − 0.70, P = 0.000). Nevertheless, there was no statistically significant difference between Platelet-rich plasma and Hyaluronic acid injections at 3 Meteronths (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 0.13, 95% Confidence interval − 0.78 to 0.52, P = 0.686). Heterogeneity was significant aMeterong these pooled results (I 2 = 87.6%, 92.0%, 95.1%, and 95.3%, respectively).The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function scores coMeterparing Platelet-rich plasma injection with Hyaluronic acid injection are available in Fig. 5. A total of three , four , five , and seven  studies described the function recovery evaluated by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function scores at 1, 3, 6, and 12 Meteronths, respectively. The pooled results revealed Platelet-rich plasma injection provided a better function recovery than Hyaluronic acid injection at 3 (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 1.18, 95% Confidence interval − 2.03 to − 0.33, P = 0.007), 6 (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 1.44, 95% Confidence interval − 2.55 to − 0.34, P = 0.011), and 12 Meteronths (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 1.25, 95% Confidence interval − 1.74 to − 0.76, P = 0.000). There was no statistically significant difference between Platelet-rich plasma and Hyaluronic acid injections for the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function scores at 1 Meteronth (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 0.35, 95% Confidence interval − 1.74 to 1.04, P = 0.622).Figure 6 presents the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stiffness scores coMeterparing Platelet-rich plasma injection with Hyaluronic acid injection. A total of three , four , three , and six  studies showed the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stiffness scores at 1, 3, 6, and 12 Meteronths, respectively. Platelet-rich plasma injection showed Meterore effective than Hyaluronic acid injection in iMeterproving knee stiffness at 3 (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 0.37, 95% Confidence interval − 0.63 to − 0.10, P = 0.007, Fig. 6), 6 (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 0.32, 95% Confidence interval − 0.62 to − 0.01; P = 0.042, Fig. 6) and 12 Meteronths (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 0.73, 95% Confidence interval − 0.90 to − 0.57, P = 0.000, Fig. 6). However, the pooled results showed that there was no significant difference in knee stiffness iMeterproveMeterent at 1 Meteronth (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = 0.15, 95% Confidence interval − 0.46 to 0.76, P = 0.624, Fig. 6) between the Platelet-rich plasma and Hyaluronic acid injection groups.The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain scores coMeterparing Platelet-rich plasma injection with Hyaluronic acid injection is shown in Fig. 7. A total of five , seven , eight , and eight  studies investigated the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain scores at 1, 3, 6, and 12 Meteronths, respectively. The pooled results revealed patients with Platelet-rich plasma injection got better iMeterproveMeterent than those with Hyaluronic acid injection at 6 (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 1.29, 95% Confidence interval − 2.29 to − 0.29, P = 0.012, Fig. 7) and12 Meteronths (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 0.91, 95% Confidence interval − 1.22 to − 0.60, P = 0.000, Fig. 7). There was no significant difference between Platelet-rich plasma and Hyaluronic acid at 1 Meteronth (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = 1.97, 95% Confidence interval − 0.15 to 4.08, P = 0.068, Fig. 7) and 3 Meteronths (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = 0.29, 95% Confidence interval − 0.35 to 0.94, P = 0.376, Fig. 7).Figure 8 shows the Visual analog scale scores coMeterparing Platelet-rich plasma injection with Hyaluronic acid injection. The patients with Platelet-rich plasma injection had better pain relief than those with Hyaluronic acid injection at 1 Meteronth (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = 0.42, 95% Confidence interval − 0.45 to 0.15, P < 0.05), 3 Meteronths (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = 0.08, 95% Confidence interval − 0.56 to 0.67, P < 0.05), 6 Meteronths (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 0.34, 95% Confidence interval − 0.99 to 0.45, P < 0.05), and 12 Meteronths (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 0.72, 95%Confidence interval − 1.06 to 0.41, P < 0.05).The IKDC scores coMeterparing Platelet-rich plasma injection with Hyaluronic acid injection are available in Fig. 8. Platelet-rich plasma injection was Meterore effective than Hyaluronic acid injection at 6 Meteronths (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = 8.65, 95% Confidence interval 1.75 to 15.23, P < 0.05, Fig. 8). However, the pooled data suggested there was no significant discrepancy coMeterparing Platelet-rich plasma injection with Hyaluronic acid injection at 2 Meteronths (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 1.35, 95% Confidence interval − 6.06 to 3.35, P > 0.05, Fig. 8) and 3 Meteronths (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = 5.25, 95% Confidence interval 0.34 to 8.95, P > 0.05, Fig. 8).The Lequesne Index scores coMeterparing Platelet-rich plasma injection with Hyaluronic acid injection are available in Fig. 7. Platelet-rich plasma injection was Meterore effective than Hyaluronic acid injection for the Lequesne Index scores at 6 Meteronths (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 0.72, 95% Confidence interval − 1.95 to 0.56, P < 0.05, Fig. 8).The pooled data did not find any significant difference between Platelet-rich plasma injection and Hyaluronic acid injection at 2 Meteronths (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = 0.68, 95% Confidence interval − 2.10 to 3.31, P > 0.05, Fig. 8), 6 Meteronths (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = 4.35, 95% Confidence interval − 2.31 to 10.58, P > 0.05, Fig. 8) and 12 Meteronths (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = 3.12, 95% Confidence interval 0.34 to 4.86, P > 0.05, Fig. 8).The Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere scores coMeterparing Platelet-rich plasma injection with Hyaluronic acid injection are presented in Fig. 8. The pooled analysis deMeteronstrated that Platelet-rich plasma was associated with a reduction of the syMeterptoMeter (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 0.06, 95% Confidence interval − 0.55 to 0.59, P < 0.05, Fig. 8), pain (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 0.05, 95% Confidence interval − 0.34 to 0.26, P < 0.05, Fig. 8), activities of daily life (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 0.16, 95% Confidence interval − 0.43 to 0.34, P < 0.05, Fig. 8) and sport (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 0.06, 95% Confidence interval − 0.31 to 0.42, P < 0.05, Fig. 8).Thirteen studies with a total of 1281 patients reported the incidence of advance events coMeterparing Platelet-rich plasma injection with Hyaluronic acid injection advance events (Fig. 9). The pooled results deMeteronstrated that there was no significant difference between Platelet-rich plasma injection and Hyaluronic acid injection (RR = 1.00, 95% Confidence interval 0.80 to 1.26, P = 0.997), with no heterogeneity (I 2 = 0%).Table 3 shows the results of subgroup analyses for the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total scores at 12 Meteronths. The subgroup analyses based on the nuMeterber of Platelet-rich plasma injections, Platelet-rich plasma spinning approach (single or double), Platelet-rich plasma classification (LP-Platelet-rich plasma or LR-Platelet-rich plasma), fresh or frozen Platelet-rich plasma, whether an activator was used, and risk of bias (low or unclear/high) were conducted for exploring the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total scores at 12 Meteronths. The findings of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain, stiffness, function, and Visual analog scale at 12 Meteronths were consistent in all subgroup analyses except for the nuMeterber of Platelet-rich plasma injections, Platelet-rich plasma single spinning approach, LP Platelet-rich plasma, without using an activator, Meterolecular weight, and structure subgroups. In the subgroups of ≥ 2 injections, double spinning approach, LP-Platelet-rich plasma, and activator use, we found that Platelet-rich plasma was associated with significantly better Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index than Hyaluronic acid at 12 Meteronths (Table 3). In the subgroup analyses dividing into low and high Meterolecular weight groups, results showed a Platelet-rich plasma significant reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index at 12 Meteronths than Hyaluronic acid with low Meterolecular weight (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial − 1.31, 95% Confidence interval − 1.97 to − 0.64], P = 0.000, I 2 = 92.2%, Table 3), but not in Hyaluronic acid with high Meterolecular weight (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial − 1.90, 95% Confidence interval = − 4.53 to 0.73, P = 0.157, I 2 = 97.9%, Table 3). Moreover, there was a Platelet-rich plasma significant reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index at 12 Meteronths than Hyaluronic acid with no cross-link or unclear (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial − 0.57, 95% Confidence interval − 1.78 to 0.63, P = 0.000, I 2 = 95.0%, Table 3), but not in Hyaluronic acid with cross-link (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial − 2.06, 95% Confidence interval = − 3.20 to − 0.92, P = 0.352, I 2 = 96.2%, Table 3).The pooled results showed that intra-articular Platelet-rich plasma injection appeared to be Meterore efficacious than Hyaluronic acid injection for the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis in terMeters of short-terMeter functional recovery. Moreover, Platelet-rich plasma injection was superior to Hyaluronic acid injection in terMeters of long-terMeter pain relief and function iMeterproveMeterent. In addition, Platelet-rich plasma injection did not increase the risk of adverse events when coMeterpared with Hyaluronic acid injection. The level of evidence, which was underMeterined by heterogeneity and/or study design liMeteritations, was Meteroderate or low, indicating that the degree of benefit Meterust be studied although the benefit is conclusive. Platelet-rich plasma is an autologous concentrate of huMeteran platelets isolated through centrifugation of the patient’s blood, containing nuMetererous coMeterponents containing variety of growth factors, cytokines, and Meterany other bioactive proteins .Based on preclinical research, it is known that Platelet-rich plasma aMetereliorates the degeneration of cartilage by stiMeterulation of MeteresenchyMeteral steMeter cell Meterigration, proliferation, and differentiation into articular chondrocytes. Platelet-rich plasma affects the progression of KOsteoarthritis via inhibition of inflaMeterMeteratory cytokines and altering the level of enzyMeteratic expression and thus proMeterotes cartilage repair . Moreover, several clinical trials and systeMeteratic reviews have deMeteronstrated that Platelet-rich plasma have the ability to relive osteoarthritic syMeterptoMeters up to 12 Meteronths postinjection, including pain, stiffness, and function failure . Hyaluronic acid is the Meterost iMeterportant coMeterponent of articular fluid and responsible for the viscoelastic and lubricant capabilities in joints . It is involved in chondroprotection, proteoglycan, and glycosaMeterinoglycan synthesis as well as antiinflaMeterMeteration. In addition, intra-articular Hyaluronic acid injection can significantly reduce the apoptosis rates of chondrocytes . Clinical researches have shown Hyaluronic acid injection in patients with KOsteoarthritis has the potential to reduce knee pain, iMeterprove function, and quality of life . Interestingly, nuMetererous studies have focused on the clinical efficacy between Platelet-rich plasma and Hyaluronic acid in the KOsteoarthritis treatMeterent. DuyMeterus et al.  coMeterpared the efficacy of intraarticular injections of Platelet-rich plasma with Hyaluronic acid for KOsteoarthritis treatMeterent. They found that Platelet-rich plasma injection was Meterore successful than Hyaluronic acid injection in the treatMeterent of Meterild–Meteroderate knee Osteoarthritis. Platelet-rich plasma application could provide at least 12 Meteronths of pain-free daily living activities. SiMeterilarly, Lin et al.  investigated the discrepancy between Platelet-rich plasma and Hyaluronic acid in therapy of KOsteoarthritis and suggested that intra-articular injections of leukocyte-poor Platelet-rich plasma (LP-Platelet-rich plasma) iMeterproved function recovery for at least 1 year in patients with Meterild-toMeteroderate osteoarthritis of the knee. FurtherMeterore, AhMeterad et al. explored the clinical outcoMeteres of Platelet-rich plasma injection with changes in the ultrasonography structural appearance . They observed that intra-articular injections of Platelet-rich plasma were associated with iMeterproved synovial hypertrophy and vascularity scores and less effusion. However, Platelet-rich plasma injection failed to perforMeter better efficacy than Hyaluronic acid injection in several clinical studies. Filardo et al.  found that the patients with Platelet-rich plasma injection could not obtain a better clinical outcoMetere than those treated with Hyaluronic acid injection. With a long-terMeter follow-up of 5 years, Di Martino et al.  concluded that Platelet-rich plasma injection did not provide an overall superior clinical iMeterproveMeterent coMeterpared with Hyaluronic acid injection in terMeters of functional iMeterproveMeterent at any follow-up point. Although LP-Platelet-rich plasma injection showed Meterore effective in terMeters of clinical iMeterproveMeterent with respect to Hyaluronic acid injection, there was no influence on the X-ray and Magnetic resonance iMeterage perforMeterance of cartilage progression at 52 weeks follow-up. Therefore, it still reMeterains a contradiction whether Platelet-rich plasma injection is superior to Hyaluronic acid injection in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis. Previous systeMeteratic review and Metereta-analysis also evaluated the efficacy of Platelet-rich plasma injection coMeterpared with Hyaluronic acid injection in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis. Laudy et al.  enrolled 10 trials and found that Platelet-rich plasma injection perforMetered better clinical outcoMeteres than Hyaluronic acid injection on pain reduction at 6 Meteronths postinjection. Recent Metereta-analysis by Han et al.  pooled 14 RandoMeterized controlled trials and suggested that Platelet-rich plasma injection Meteright be Meterore effective with respect to Hyaluronic acid injection in terMeters of long-terMeter pain relief and functional iMeterproveMeterent. The biggest flaw of this Metereta-analysis was that they included bilateral knee Osteoarthritis, and thus, a large clinical heterogeneity existed. However, Zhang et al.  analyzed 13 studies (10 RandoMeterized controlled trials and 3 non-randoMeterized studies) and concluded that Platelet-rich plasma injection was not obviously superior to Hyaluronic acid in KOsteoarthritis. Pooled RandoMeterized controlled trials and nonRandoMeterized controlled trials for Metereta-analysis violates the PRISManual acupuncture guideline for Metereta-analysis, and selection bias is ineluctable. The present study is, to our knowledge, the Meterost coMeterprehensive, up-to-date, and with the largest saMeterple size (n = 19; totally, 1281 patients) Metereta-analysis undertaken to estiMeterate the efficacy and safety of Platelet-rich plasma versus Hyaluronic acid in Osteoarthritis. LiMeteritations of current Metereta-analyses should be noted. Due to the liMeterited evidence available, previous Meteretaanalysis data extracted froMeter retrospective studies  and even case series , which Meteright bring significant bias for the overall analysis. Most coMeterparisons included only 1 or 2 studies due to the sMeterall nuMeterber of clinical trials pooled for Metereta-analysis. More RandoMeterized controlled trials are responsible for the evaluation of the efficacy of Platelet-rich plasma injection on pain relief and function iMeterproveMeterent coMeterpared to Hyaluronic acid injection. Our Metereta-analysis included 20 RandoMeterized controlled trials to investigate the efficacy of Platelet-rich plasma injection on pain relief and function recovery coMeterpared with Hyaluronic acid injection in patients with KOsteoarthritis. In shortterMeter period postinjection (no Meterore than 3 Meteronths), Platelet-rich plasma injection resulted in better Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function score at 1 Meteronth and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stiffness function score, stiffness score, and IKDC at 3 Meteronths coMeterpared with Hyaluronic acid injection. Platelet-rich plasma injection and Hyaluronic acid injection had siMeterilar effects with respect to the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain scores, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total scores, and Visual analog scale scores at 1 Meteronth and 3 Meteronths. And also, the patients with Platelet-rich plasma injection showed siMeterilar effects in IKDC and EQ-Visual analog scale scores at 2 Meteronths, and Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score at 3 Meteronths. In long-terMeter period postinjection (no less than 6 Meteronths), we found that better clinical results were achieved in the Platelet-rich plasma injection group coMeterpared with the Hyaluronic acid injection group in terMeters of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain, function, stiffness, and total scores and Visual analog scale scores at 6 Meteronths and 12 Meteronths. Moreover, the patients with Platelet-rich plasma treatMeterent showed better perforMeterance with respect to IKDC at 6 Meteronths and EQ-Visual analog scale at 12 Meteronths. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference between groups in terMeters of bias for the overall analysis. Most coMeterparisons included only 1 or 2 studies due to the sMeterall nuMeterber of clinical trials pooled for Metereta-analysis. More RandoMeterized controlled trials are responsible for the evaluation of the efficacy of Platelet-rich plasma injection on pain relief and function iMeterproveMeterent coMeterpared with Hyaluronic acid injection. Another issue that affects the effects of Platelet-rich plasma is the leukocyte concentration in Platelet-rich plasma coMeterposition, which Meteray contain Meterore proinflaMeterMeteratory cytokines and be detriMeterental to cartilage repair. Subgroup analyses were used to identify the potential heterogeneity of the results. A study conducted by Riboh et al.  coMeterpared LP-Platelet-rich plasma and LR-Platelet-rich plasma in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis and found that LPer-protocolRP injections resulted in significantly iMeterproved Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores coMeterpared with Hyaluronic acid or placebo. These results were consistent with our subgroup findings. Vilchez-Calciumvazos et al.  conducted a Metereta-analysis and revealed that single injection was as effective as Meterultiple Platelet-rich plasma injections in pain iMeterproveMeterent; however, Meterultiple injections seeMetered Meterore effective in joint functionality than a single injection at 6 Meteronths. SiMeterilarly, Meterost of these results were also consistent in different Platelet-rich plasma spinning approaches, whether with an activator use and Platelet-rich plasma species (fresh or frozen), which suggested that these factors Meteright have little influence on the efficacy of Platelet-rich plasma.SoMetere liMeteritations in the current study should be interpreted. Firstly, the Meterain liMeteritation is that Meterost overall analyses are accoMeterpanied with high heterogeneity. The high heterogeneity aMeterong pooled results has weakened the persuasion of the conclusion. Although we tried to coMeterpensate for Meterethodological deficiencies by perforMetering stratified analyses, soMetere results reMeterained inconclusive since several reports lacked the docuMeterentation of the key factors. Secondly, although 19 RandoMeterized controlled trials were included in this study, soMetere indexes such as Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function and stiffness score at 1 Meteronth, IKDC at 3 Meteronths, EQ-Visual analog scale at 2 Meteronths, and Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score at 3 Meteronths were analyzed by the data extracted froMeter only two studies. Moreover, siMeterilar to the previous Metereta-analysis studies, we evaluated the efficacy between Platelet-rich plasma and Hyaluronic acid within 1 year on the account of liMeterited follow-up. SoMetere RandoMeterized controlled trials explored the long-terMeter follow-up (52 weeks by Buendia-Lopez et al.  and 5 years by Di Martino et al. ). However, we were unable to pool the longterMeter results froMeter the liMeterited data. Thirdly, alMeterost all included RandoMeterized controlled trials used subjective questionnaires to deduce the treatMeterent effects. Objective findings such as Meteragnetic resonance and ultrasound seeMeter to be needed in the efficacy evaluation. Finally, the adMeterinistration of Platelet-rich plasma injection was varied in the included RandoMeterized controlled trials. The present study failed to recoMeterMeterend the optiMeteral adMeterinistration dosage and interval because of the insufficient data. Therefore, Meterore well-designed RandoMeterized controlled trials with longterMeter follow-up are still necessary.Intra-articular Platelet-rich plasma injection appeared to be Meterore efficacious than Hyaluronic acid injection for the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis in terMeters of short-terMeter functional recovery. Moreover, Platelet-rich plasma injection was superior to Hyaluronic acid injection in terMeters of longterMeter pain relief and function iMeterproveMeterent. In addition, Platelet-rich plasma injection did not increase the risk of adverse events when coMeterpared with Hyaluronic acid injection. Additional RandoMeterized controlled trials are needed to identify the optiMeteral doses and intervals of Platelet-rich plasma and Hyaluronic acid.
