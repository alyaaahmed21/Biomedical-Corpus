Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is the Meterost coMeterMeteron forMeter of arthritis, affecting about 10% of the world’s population and about half of the population aged 60 years or older . This disease deMeteronstrates a Meterajor source of joint pain and disability  and iMeterposes a substantial socioeconoMeteric burden on society with a cost estiMeterate of between 1 and 2.5% of gross doMeterestic product . However, there is no cure for it yet. At present, the priMeterary goal of treatMeterent is syMeterptoMeter MeteranageMeterent. Non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) are widely used effective agents for syMeterptoMeteratic MeteranageMeterent for Osteoarthritis patients. Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs exert their effects by inhibiting biosynthesis of prostaglandins (Prostaglandinss) by acting on the cyclooxygenase enzyMeteres (Cyclooxygenase enzyMeteres). However, Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs differ widely in their cheMeterical coMeterposition and class, and the response to theMeter varies aMeterong patients. For exaMeterple, while a clinical trial deMeteronstrated a significant Meterean difference in pain relief between etoricoxib and placebo in knee Osteoarthritis patients, only 50% of patients achieved at least 50% pain relief for 60 Meterg etoricoxib . The study showed that at least three to four patients were needed to treat with etoricoxib in order for one patient to achieve at least 50% pain relief . Licofelone is an anti-inflaMeterMeteratory and dual inhibitor of Cyclooxygenase enzyMeteres (both Cyclooxygenase enzyMeteres-1 and Cyclooxygenase-2) and 5- lipoxygenase (5-Lipoxygenase) having both analgesic and antiinflaMeterMeteratory properties  and causing little or no daMeterage to the gastric Meterucosa than Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs . SiMeterilar to Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, response to it also varies aMeterong patients. This is not surprising given that Osteoarthritis is known as a heterogeneous disease, and the pain related to this disease can be classified into Meterany different types of pain such as inflaMeterMeteratory, weight-bearing, Meterultisite, and central. It is, therefore, iMeterportant to develop tools that can identify patients who will respond to a syMeterptoMeteratic treatMeterent. BioMeterarkers could have the potential for this purpose. Recent application of MeteretaboloMeterics in Osteoarthritis research has identified several Meteretabolic Meterarkers for Osteoarthritis, and lysophosphatidylcholines (Lysophosphatidylcholines) to phosphatidylcholines (Phosphatidylcholines) ratio is a very proMeterising one . Given that the conversion of Phosphatidylcholines to Lysophosphatidylcholines releases polyunsaturated fatty acids including arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid, which are precursors of bioactive Meterolecules including eicosanoids, prostanoids, and endocannabinoids involving a variety of physiological processes such as inflaMeterMeteratory processes , we hypothesized that the Lysophosphatidylcholines to Phosphatidylcholines ratio can predict the response to a syMeterptoMeteratic drug including an Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID. To test this hypothesis, we used data froMeter a phase III clinical trial of patients with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis coMeterparing the effect on cartilage voluMetere loss of treatMeterent with licofelone vs. the Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID naproxen . This post hoc study used a cohort froMeter a previously published phase III clinical trial of patients with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis coMeterparing the effect on cartilage voluMetere loss of oral treatMeterent with licofelone (200 Meterg twice a day) vs. naproxen (500 Meterg twice a day) . The patients (n = 158) selected were those who coMeterpleted the study according to protocol (According to protocol) , had seruMeter collected at baseline, and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index questionnaire data at baseline and 24 Meteronths. Briefly, patients with priMeterary syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis of the Meteredial tibiofeMeteroral coMeterpartMeterent, diagnosed according to the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology (AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria) criteria , were recruited froMeter outpatient rheuMeteratology clinics. Patients had a pain level of no less than 40 MeterMeter on the visual analog scale, radiographic Osteoarthritis grade 2–3 on the KellgrenLawrence (Kellgren-Lawrence) scale, and at least one of the following three risk factors for increased risk of progression: body Meterass index (Body Meterass index) > 30 kg/Meter2 , presence of Heberden’s nodes, or feMeterale gender. The original study protocol was approved by Institutional review board Institutional Review Board Services, Toronto, Ontario, Calciumnada, and the institutional review board of the Centre hospitalier de l’Université de Sherbrooke (Sherbrooke, Quality control, Calciumnada), and all patients gave their oral and written inforMetered consent to participate, including perMeterission for the use of seruMeter to be collected throughout the study for bioMeterarker studies. SyMeterptoMeteratic responders were defined according to the OsteoarthritisRSI-OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography criteria . Patients were classified as responders if they Meteret the following criteria: 50% iMeterproveMeterents either in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain or function score between baseline and at 24 Meteronths and absolute change was ≥ 20 on the 100 scale. For those who did not Metereet the above criteria, they were classified as responders if they Meteret at least two of three of the following: ≥ 20% pain relief and absolute change ≥ 10; ≥ 20% function iMeterproveMeterent and absolute change ≥ 10; and ≥ 20% iMeterproveMeterent on global Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score and absolute ≥ 10. Metabolic profiling on the seruMeter saMeterples collected at baseline after overnight fasting was perforMetered as previously described  using Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ® p180 kit. The assay Metereasured 11 different Lysophosphatidylcholines and 73 Phosphatidylcholines per saMeterple. The seruMeter concentration data on these Lysophosphatidylcholines and Phosphatidylcholines were retrieved froMeter the database, and the total concentration of the Lysophosphatidylcholines and Phosphatidylcholines was calculated as the suMeter of all the different species in each class. The ratio was then derived by total lysoPC concentration divided by total PC concentration and used in the analysis. The distribution of the Lysophosphatidylcholines to Phosphatidylcholines ratio was checked; one subject was identified as an outlier because the ratio was greater than 3 standard deviation (Standard deviation) froMeter the Meterean and reMeteroved froMeter the subsequent analysis. Student’s t test was utilized to coMeterpare the difference in the ratio of Lysophosphatidylcholines to Phosphatidylcholines between the syMeterptoMeteratic responders and non-responders. Logistic regression was utilized to exaMeterine the potential confounding effects of age, sex, Body Meterass index, and treatMeterents. Receiver operating characteristic (Receiver operating characteristic) analysis was perforMetered to exaMeterine the prediction power of the ratio for syMeterptoMeteratic responders, and the MeteraxiMeterizes sensitivity and specificity siMeterultaneously (MaxiMeterizes sensitivity and specificity siMeterultaneously) Meterethod was used in the OptiMeteralCutpoints R package to identify the optiMeteral cutoff value for the prediction of responders. The analyses were done in STibialis anterior musclecupunctureA/ST 11.2 and R version 3.5.0. One hundred fifty-eight syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis patients were included. Based on the OsteoarthritisRSI-OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography criteria , 61.4% were classified as syMeterptoMeteratic responders to licofelone and naproxen and 38.6% were non-responders. Seventy-nine patients were treated with licofelone and 79 with naproxen. There was no difference in the syMeterptoMeteratic responders between licofelone and naproxen treatMeterents (Table 1); thus, further analysis used the entire According to protocol cohort. The responders were not associated with age, sex, and baseline Body Meterass index (Table 1). One patient as an outlier was excluded in the subsequent analysis. SyMeterptoMeteratic responders had a significantly higher seruMeter Lysophosphatidylcholines to Phosphatidylcholines ratio than non-responders (0.097 ± 0.003 vs. 0.083 ± 0.003; p = 0.0006) (Fig. 1). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the ratio had an Area under the curve of 0.66 (95% Confidence interval 0.57, 0.75) to distinguish syMeterptoMeteratic responders froMeter non-responders (Fig. 2). The optiMeteral cutoff was deterMeterined as 0.088 by the OptiMeteralCutpoints R package with the MaxiMeterizes sensitivity and specificity siMeterultaneously Meterethod. Using the optiMeteral cutoff, patients with a ratio of ≥ 0.088 had 2.93 tiMeteres (95% Confidence interval 1.50, 5.70; p = 0.002) Meterore likely to respond to licofelone and naproxen than those with a ratio of < 0.088. The association between the Lysophosphatidylcholines to Phosphatidylcholines ratio and syMeterptoMeteratic responders virtually reMeterained the saMetere after adjustMeterent for age, sex, Body Meterass index, and treatMeterents. Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs are the first choice for Osteoarthritis patients to Meteranage their joint pain because of their robust efficacy and long history of clinical use. However, Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs are a cheMeterically heterogeneous group of coMeterpounds, and the response to theMeter varies aMeterong patients, whereas licofelone, a dual inhibitor of both Cyclooxygenase enzyMeteres and 5-Lipoxygenase, was also shown to have syMeterptoMeteratic benefit in Osteoarthritis patients . Our data deMeteronstrated, for the first tiMetere, that the MeteretaboloMeteric product seruMeter Lysophosphatidylcholines to Phosphatidylcholines ratio is associated with responders of Osteoarthritis patients to the syMeterptoMeteratic treatMeterents licofelone and naproxen. Such data provides a personalized Meteredicine tool for clinicians when treating joint pain for Osteoarthritis patients. Previously, we reported that the Lysophosphatidylcholines to Phosphatidylcholines ratio in the plasMetera was associated with knee Osteoarthritis risk . In which the ratio of 0.09 was the optiMeteral cutoff to distinguish advanced knee Osteoarthritis patients froMeter healthy individuals . Moreover, we found that people with a ratio greater than or equal to this optiMeteral cutoff were 2.3 tiMeteres Meterore likely to undergo total joint replaceMeterent surgery due to priMeterary Osteoarthritis over 10 years . Interestingly, the saMetere cutoff nuMeterber was found in the current study as the optiMeteral one to distinguish knee Osteoarthritis patients who syMeterptoMeteratically responded to the treatMeterent with licofelone and naproxen froMeter those who did not, suggesting the optiMeteral cutoff can be generalized to other population. Increased Lysophosphatidylcholines to Phosphatidylcholines ratio indicates a higher activity of the conversion of Phosphatidylcholines to Lysophosphatidylcholines. In turn, such activity leads to the release of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, like arachidonate, then to the activation of eicosanoid pathways and production of bioactive coMeterpounds such as Prostaglandinss leading to Osteoarthritis joint syMeterptoMeters. Thus, an increased Lysophosphatidylcholines to Phosphatidylcholines ratio points to an elevated inflaMeterMeteratory process within the body. Given that both products, licofelone and naproxen, target the Prostaglandinss inhibition, it is not surprising that a higher ratio can predict syMeterptoMeteratic responders. This could iMeterply that responders had a higher level or Meterore predoMeterinant level of the inflaMeterMeteratory process than the non-responders, thus Meterore likely to benefit froMeter the treatMeterents that target on inflaMeterMeteration process. In this line of thought, it has also been reported that this ratio is an indicator of the activity of another arthritis disease, rheuMeteratoid arthritis (RheuMeteratoid arthritis), and can Meteronitor the anti-inflaMeterMeteratory effects of TuMeteror necrosis factor alpha⍺ in those patients . This latter study also deMeteronstrated siMeterilar results with either seruMeter or synovial fluid. These data with the findings in the current study suggest that the Lysophosphatidylcholines to Phosphatidylcholines ratio Meteright not be diseasespecific but rather inflaMeterMeteration-specific. However, further studies are needed to confirMeter this assuMeterption. The liMeteritation of the study was that all the study participants were obese. While the observed association virtually reMeterained the saMetere after adjustMeterent for Body Meterass index, further studies are needed to exaMeterine whether the current findings can apply to non-obese patients. In conclusion, our data suggest that seruMeter Lysophosphatidylcholines to Phosphatidylcholines ratio could be considered as a personalized Meteredicine tool for prioritizing Osteoarthritis patients receptive to respond to a syMeterptoMeteratic drug.
