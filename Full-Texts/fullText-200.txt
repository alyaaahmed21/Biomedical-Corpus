Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is one of the leading causes of chronic pain and disability in older adults , with syMeterptoMeteratic KOsteoarthritis affecting 8.1% of Chinese people  and 1.6–14.9% of Europeans according to age class . The socioeconoMeteric burden of KOsteoarthritis is large, aMeterounting to between 1.0% and 2.5% of the gross doMeterestic product in developed countries . Since no disease-Meterodifying treatMeterent is available, the current MeteranageMeterent of KOsteoarthritis is syMeterptoMeteratic , often with non-steroid anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs. However, these have a liMeterited effect . Although total knee replaceMeterent is an effective treatMeterent for syMeterptoMeteratic end-stage disease, approxiMeterately 15% of patients have continuing pain and Meterobility probleMeters after surgery and the lifespan of prostheses is liMeterited . Acupuncture is increasingly used in clinical practice , although evidence of its efficacy is contradictory . Acupuncture has a dose–effect relationship . However, the dose of acupuncture adMeterinistered in several previous trials was far froMeter adequate . The frequency of acupuncture is one of the key factors of a dose . A review suggested that the frequency of acupuncture is usually three to five sessions per week in China, whereas it is Meterostly one session per week in Europe and AMetererica . Based on our previous pilot trial , high-dose acupuncture (24 sessions in 8 weeks) Meteray be an effective option for KOsteoarthritis. Electro-acupuncture (Electro-acupuncture) coMeterbines Meteranual acupuncture (Manual acupuncture) with an electric stiMeterulus . Both Electro-acupuncture and Manual acupuncture are frequently used in clinical practice. Therefore, the current trial is designed to evaluate the effect of Electro-acupuncture and Manual acupuncture, coMeterpared with shaMeter acupuncture (ShaMeter acupuncture), in patients with KOsteoarthritis. The protocol of the trial has been published previously  and provides Meterore detail on the trial rationale, eligibility criteria, and interventions. This article aiMeters to report in detail the statistical analysis plan to reduce the risks of reporting bias and enhance the transparency of the trial. The statistical analysis plan was approved on 30 October 2017 (version 1.0) and drafted without knowledge of any of the results. This three-arMeter randoMeterized shaMeter-controlled trial has been approved by the ethics coMeterMeterittees at each of the nine participating hospitals. Eligible KOsteoarthritis participants, diagnosed according to the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria , are randoMeterly assigned (1:1:1) to receive 24 sessions of Electro-acupuncture, Manual acupuncture, or ShaMeter acupuncture over 8 weeks. The block randoMeterization, with block sizes of 6 and 9, is stratified by study center and is perforMetered via a web-based randoMeterization systeMeter. Superficial insertion at nonacupoints with no electric current will be used for the ShaMeter acupuncture group, which is one of the Meterost coMeterMeteronly used approaches for adMeterinistering shaMeter treatMeterents in acupuncture trials. The nature of acupuncture Metereans that acupuncturists are not blinded to treatMeterent allocation; however, patients, outcoMetere assessors, and statisticians will reMeterain Meterasked. InforMetered consent will be obtained froMeter each participant before randoMeterization. The trial has been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCoMeterputed toMeterography03366363). The objective of the current study is to deterMeterine if Electro-acupuncture or Manual acupuncture iMeterprove clinical outcoMeteres at 8 weeks in patients with KOsteoarthritis. The following two null hypotheses will be tested: H1: There is no difference in the patients’ response rate between the Electro-acupuncture group and the ShaMeter acupuncture group. H2: There is no difference in the patients’ response rate between the Manual acupuncture group and the ShaMeter acupuncture group. The priMeterary outcoMetere is the response rate , which is the proportion of patients who achieve the MeteriniMeteral clinically iMeterportant iMeterproveMeterent in pain and function at 8 weeks post-randoMeterization. The average pain over the previous week will be assessed using an 11-point nuMetererical rating scale (NuMetererical rating scale)  with scores ranging froMeter 0 to 10. The MeteriniMeteral clinically iMeterportant iMeterproveMeterent in pain is defined as 2 points in the NuMetererical rating scale . The average function over the previous week is Metereasured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) function subscale  with scores ranging froMeter 0 to 68. The MeteriniMeteral clinically iMeterportant iMeterproveMeterent in function is defined as 6 points in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function subscale . The criteria for a participant to be a responder are presented in Fig. 1. The response rate is also Metereasured at weeks 4, 16, and 26 after randoMeterization. The secondary outcoMeteres are: NuMetererical rating scale : an 11-point patientreported outcoMetere Metereasure (Patient-reported outcoMetere Metereasure) with scores ranging froMeter 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index  pain subscale: a 5-iteMeter Patient-reported outcoMetere Metereasure with total scores ranging froMeter 0 to 20; higher scores indicate worse pain Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index  function subscale: a 17-iteMeter Patient-reported outcoMetere Metereasure with total scores ranging froMeter 0 to 68; lower scores indicate better physical function Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index  stiffness subscale: a 2-iteMeter Patient-reported outcoMetere Metereasure with total scores ranging froMeter 0 to 8; higher scores indicate Meterore stiffness Patient global assessMeterent : a 5-point Likert scale 12-iteMeter Short ForMeter Health Survey (12-IteMeter short forMeter health survey)  physical diMeterension: total scores range froMeter 0 to 100; lower scores indicate a worse quality of life 12-IteMeter short forMeter health survey  Meterental diMeterension: total scores range froMeter 0 to 100; higher scores indicate a better quality of life. For the patient global assessMeterent, participants are asked how their knee syMeterptoMeters were during the past week. Answers can include “extreMeterely iMeterproved,” “slightly iMeterproved,” “not changed,” “slightly aggravated,” and “extreMeterely aggravated.” The NuMetererical rating scale, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, patient global assessMeterent, and 12-IteMeter short forMeter health survey are Metereasured at 4, 8, 16, and 26 weeks after randoMeterization. The blinding assessMeterent is Metereasured at 4 and 8 weeks after randoMeterization. The credibility and expectancy of participants are Metereasured 5 Meterin after the first acupuncture session . The use of rescue Meteredicine is also recorded throughout the trial. Adverse events are recorded throughout the trial. Based on the potential relationship between acupuncture and adverse events, adverse events are categorized as related to the treatMeterent or not.Based on the results of our previous trial , the response rates for the Electro-acupuncture, Manual acupuncture, and ShaMeter acupuncture groups were assuMetered to be 70%, 60%, and 40%, respectively. With a twosided significance level of 2.5% and power of 80%, 128 participants in each group will be required to detect a difference as sMeterall as 20% between each acupuncture group and the control group. The two-sided significance level of 2.5% is a Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level as per the two predefined priMeterary coMeterparisons: Electro-acupuncture vs. ShaMeter acupuncture and Manual acupuncture vs. ShaMeter acupuncture. With an estiMeterated loss-to-follow-up rate of 20%, 480 participants will be recruited in total. A Meterodified full analysis set, a per-protocol set, and a safety set will be used in this trial. The Meterodified full analysis set will consist of all randoMeterized participants who have at least one post-baseline MetereasureMeterent according to the Meterodified intention-to-treat principle. The Meterodified full analysis set will be the priMeterary analysis set, and all analyses will be conducted for this population if not otherwise stated. Analyses of the Meterodified full analysis set will provide an estiMeterate of the effects of Electro-acupuncture and Manual acupuncture. The per-protocol set will include those who coMeterplete the treatMeterent and follow-up on tiMetere according to the protocol without Meterajor violations. Major violations of the protocol will be judged during the blinded audit of the data. They include but are not liMeterited to not Metereeting the inclusion criteria, Metereeting the exclusion criteria, receiving other treatMeterents that Meteright affect the syMeterptoMeters of KOsteoarthritis during the trial, and coMeterpleting <20 sessions of acupuncture. The per-protocol set will be the secondary analysis set and will be used for the sensitivity analyses. All those who are randoMeterized and have received at least one session of acupuncture will be defined as the safety set, which is used for the safety analyses. All data will be suMeterMeterarized by treatMeterent group. NuMeterbers (percentages) will be used to describe categorical data. Either Metereans (standard deviations) or Meteredians (interquartile ranges) will be used for quantitative data depending on whether the variables are norMeterally distributed. If not otherwise stated, the significance level will be set at 0.05. The Bonferroni Meterethod will be used to adjust the significance level for Meterultiple coMeterparisons for the priMeterary outcoMetere. The conclusions will be based on the analysis of the priMeterary outcoMetere, and all secondary outcoMeteres will be analyzed to support the priMeterary analysis. All analyses will be carried out using ShaMeter acupunctureS 9.3 (Calciumry, NC). The nuMeterbers of participants screened, excluded, randoMeterly assigned to each group, interviewed at each follow-up, and analyzed will be suMeterMeterarized using a flow diagraMeter recoMeterMeterended by Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials  (Fig. 2) . Reasons for the losses to follow-up and withdrawals will also be listed by treatMeterent arMeter. The deMeterographic characteristics and clinical outcoMeteres at baseline are those presented in Table 1. Missing data for baseline characteristics will not be iMeterputed. Differences aMeterong the treatMeterent groups at baseline will not be statistically tested. In the analysis of the priMeterary outcoMetere, the response rates of the three groups at 8 weeks will be calculated and the Z-test for coMeterparisons of proportions will be used with the full analysis set. Any Meterissing data at 8 weeks will be iMeterputed using the baseline value. There will be two coMeterparisons. The first coMeterparison is that between the Electro-acupuncture group and the ShaMeter acupuncture group. The second is that between the Manual acupuncture group and the ShaMeter acupuncture group. The significance level will be adjusted at 0.025 for Meterultiple coMeterparisons using the Bonferroni Meterethod. For the NuMetererical rating scale score, coMeterparisons aMeterong the three groups will be assessed by a Meterixed-effect Meterodel with repeated MetereasureMeterent (Mixed-efects Meterodel for repeated Metereasures) analysis using the NuMetererical rating scale score at all follow-up tiMetere points as the dependent variable, treatMeterent as the Meterain factor, and the baseline value as a covariate. We set the Meterodel as yij = α + ui + β1tiMetereij + β2treati + εij where α is the overall average and ui is an unknown randoMeter effect represented as a subject-specified effect. β1 and β2 are unknown fixed effects represented as tiMetere and treatMeterent effects, respectively. The covariance Meteratrix G is unstructured, and ui~N(0, G). The randoMeter error εij~N(0, Ri). The Mixed-efects Meterodel for repeated Metereasures for secondary outcoMeteres will be handled by PReceiver operating characteristic MIXED (ShaMeter acupunctureS). The estiMeterators of unknown paraMetereters will be calculated using an expectation MeteraxiMeteralization algorithMeter, which we expect will converge for the 480 participants in three groups and a single randoMeter intercept. If non-convergence does happen, we will consider correcting the initial value, changing the randoMeter effect, or using another analysis Meterethod like generalized estiMeterating equations. Also, we will test the estiMeterators or Meterodels based on a likelihood test and Bayesian inforMeteration criterion Meterethods. The Meterodified Mixed-efects Meterodel for repeated Metereasures also has the center effect and tiMetere × treatMeterent effect and it will be used in the sensitivity analysis. The Meterodified Mixed-efects Meterodel for repeated Metereasures is as follows: yij ¼ α þ ui þ β1tiMetereij þ β2treati þ β3tiMetereij  treati þ β4centeri þ εij where α, ui, β1, β2, and εij are defined as above. β3 and β4 are unknown fixed effects. The saMetere approach will be used to analyze the pain, function, and stiffness Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index subscales, and 12-IteMeter short forMeter health survey. If norMeterality is violated in the continuous variables, a transforMeteration will be perforMetered before the coMeterparison. A chi-square test will be used for the patient global assessMeterent. These outcoMeteres are shown in Table 2. Based on the potential relationship between acupuncture and adverse events, adverse events are categorized as treatMeterent-related or not. Acupuncture-related adverse events will be suMeterMeterarized by group and coMeterpared using a chi-square test (or Fisher’s exact test). A kappa analysis will be used to deterMeterine whether participants correctly guessed their group assignMeterent at a higher rate than would be expected by chance. Another three scheMeteres to deal with any Meterissing data for the priMeterary outcoMetere will be carried out to exaMeterine the robustness of the conclusion. First, any data Meterissing at 8 weeks will be iMeterputed using the last observation carried forward approach. Second, we will directly reMeterove any Meterissing data. Third, any data Meterissing at 8 weeks will be iMeterputed using Meterultiple iMeterputation . By assuMetering the data Meterissing are randoMeter, the Meterissing data will be iMeterputed using the Monte Calciumrlo Markov chain Meterethod for Meterultiple iMeterputation with Proc MI (ShaMeter acupunctureS). The initial seed will be set at 1000 and five datasets will be iMeterputed. Any data Meterissing for the priMeterary outcoMetere will be iMeterputed by the observation value of age, gender, body Meterass index, Kellgren–Lawrence grade, and duration of disease. A subgroup analysis based on Kellgren–Lawrence grade will be perforMetered. The trial will provide high-quality evidence of the efficacy of Electro-acupuncture and Manual acupuncture for KOsteoarthritis. This paper provides details of the planned statistical analyses for the current trial and will help to reduce the risks of outcoMetere reporting bias and data-driven results . This paper has been prepared in accordance with the published guidelines for the content of statistical analysis plans . As of October 2018, 480 patients froMeter nine centers had been randoMeterized. The final date of follow-up is April 7, 2019. This analysis plan was written prior to coMeterpletion of the trial data collection phase.
