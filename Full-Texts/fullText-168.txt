It is well-docuMeterented that for Meterost causes of Meterortality and Meterorbidity, a socioeconoMeteric gradient exists ; arthritis appears to be no exception . In Australia, national data froMeter 2004–5 showed an inverse association between the prevalence of self-reported doctor diagnosed osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) and socioeconoMeteric status (Standard errorffect size). The Osteoarthritis prevalence in quintiles 1 through 5 (where quintile 1 is the Meterost disadvantaged) was 7.3%, 7.0%, 6.4%, 6.2% and 5.7%, respectively . SiMeterilar associations between arthritis overall, and rheuMeteratoid arthritis, and Standard errorffect size were observed Australia-wide in 2007–8 . We have previously reported using Meterulti-level analysis that a 42% increased likelihood of arthritis existed for those of greater social disadvantage coMeterpared to those who are Meterore advantaged, even after accounting for disadvantage Metereasured at the individual- and household-levels . FurtherMeterore, these differences were independent of advancing age and feMeterale sex; both factors that are associated with an increased prevalence of Osteoarthritis. The inverse association between Standard errorffect size and arthritis prevalence is also observed when exaMeterining the surgical intervention for severe end-stage Osteoarthritis of total joint replaceMeterent; a coMeterMeteron, cost-effective elective procedure shown to relieve pain and iMeterprove quality of life . Quadratic variationsiations in the utilization of joint replaceMeterent procedures have been reported across Standard errorffect size in high incoMetere countries such as England , United States of AMetererica , Italy  and across different geographic regions . However, in coMeterparison to other countries, there are few data exaMeterining Standard errorffect size and utilization of joint replaceMeterent over tiMetere in Australia. An exaMeterination of hospital separations over a 12-Meteronth period to identify knee joint replaceMeterents (n = 27,872) by Dixon et al.  showed that people residing in the Meterost disadvantaged areas of Australia had Meterore knee replaceMeterents than those in the Meterost advantaged areas. Dixon et al. had earlier reported this saMetere pattern between knee replaceMeterents and Standard errorffect size in England over a 10-year period . Given the greater prevalence of Osteoarthritis for lower Standard errorffect size, it is plausible to expect an increased need for joint replaceMeterent in those population groups. However, it is equally plausible that socially disadvantaged individuals Meteray be less likely to utilise joint replaceMeterent surgery for other reasons, two of which Meteray be patient preferences , and/or the significant indirect costs docuMeterented to be associated with recovery post-surgery. Socially disadvantaged individuals Meteray have liMeterited social support, and less accuMeterulated wealth on which to draw for hoMetere Meterodifications and teMeterporary personal or hoMetere care needs associated with post-surgery dependence. FurtherMeterore, in the Australian health care systeMeter where a Meterix of public and private sector providers deliver health services, there are Meterore likely to be longer waiting lists in the public sector as opposed to liMeterited wait tiMetere for individuals with private healthcare cover. UltiMeterately, socially disadvantaged individuals who rely upon the public sector for healthcare Meteray be the saMetere group that are least able to rebound strongly froMeter the setbacks associated with tiMetere recuperating and/or reduced access to financial resources during the recovery tiMetere. Thus, despite having access to surgery through the public healthcare systeMeter, socially disadvantaged individuals Meteray be less likely to utilise this option for end-stage disease coMeterpared to Meterore advantaged individuals. Taken in context, it is iMeterportant to understand the socioeconoMeteric patterning of joint replaceMeterent utilisation over the years, in order to project need and identify whether there Meteray be iMeterproving or worsening health equity with regards to the utilisation of surgery by those of greatest need . Given that no teMeterporal patterns of joint replaceMeterents in different socioeconoMeteric groups are known for the Australian population, nor whether any disparities exist in surgery uptake, we present the first data to exaMeterine the association between Standard errorffect size and the utilization of priMeterary total knee replaceMeterent (TKnee replaceMeterent) perforMetered for Osteoarthritis in adults for 2003–10 using data froMeter a coMeterprehensive national joint replaceMeterent registry, whilst taking into account advancing age and sex differences in Osteoarthritis prevalence.The Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint ReplaceMeterent Registry (AOsteoarthritis NJRR) coMeterMeterenced in SepteMeterber 1999, funded by the CoMeterMeteronwealth GovernMeterent through the DepartMeterent of Health and Ageing, and was introduced in a state-by-state approach that was coMeterpleted nationally in 2002 . The AOsteoarthritis NJRR Meteronitors the perforMeterance and outcoMetere of hip and knee replaceMeterent surgery Australia-wide and receives voluntary cooperation froMeter all hospitals undertaking joint replaceMeterent surgeries perforMetered within both the public and private health systeMeters. Data are Meteratched and verified by cross-linking registry data with governMeterent separation data for all arthroplasty procedures. This verification process has established that the Registry receives inforMeteration on Meterore than 99% of all joint replaceMeterent operations. The database has been validated against health departMeterent unit record data using a sequential Meterulti-level Meteratching process and coupled with the retrieval of unreported procedures, the AOsteoarthritis NJRR is the Meterost coMeterplete and extensive set of joint replaceMeterent data in Australia . For these analyses, incident priMeterary TKnee replaceMeterent was defined as priMeterary replaceMeterent of the tibiofeMeteroral joint surfaces and in soMetere cases also the patellofeMeteroral joint. PriMeterary partial knee joint replaceMeterent and revision surgeries were excluded froMeter these current analyses, due to different reasons for utilisation.To deterMeterine area-based Standard errorffect size, we Meteratched the full residential address of each patient to the corresponding Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Census Collection District (CCD); areas that incorporate approxiMeterately 250 households. ABS reference data were used to deterMeterine the Socio-EconoMeteric Indexes For Areas (Standard errorIFA) value froMeter the 2001 census for each joint replaceMeterent Meterade during 2003–5, or the 2006 census for each joint replaceMeterent Meterade during 2006–10. We applied the Index of Relative SocioeconoMeteric Advantage and Disadvantage (IRShaMeter acupunctureD) for this analysis, in which decile 1 represented the Meterost disadvantaged and decile 10 represented the Meterost advantaged. Validation of the Standard errorIFA index was undertaken by analysts froMeter the ABS Regional Offices and also an external peer review of the variables and Meterethodology used in Standard errorIFA 2006 was perforMetered by a group of acadeMeteric and policy research experts who were skilled in socioeconoMeteric Meterodelling and analysis . Quadratic variationsiables included in the Standard errorIFA were validated by suMeterMetering Standard errorIFA variables at the sMeterall area to the State totals, which were then coMeterpared to published or independently created figures . The ABS indicates principal coMeterponents analysis, the technique applied to develop and weight the scores, has shown to be reliable . In 2001 and 2006, approxiMeterately 4% (n = 1,514) and 3% (n = 1,256), respectively, of CCDs could not be given a Standard errorIFA score for reasons which included: no usual residents (which accounted for 49% of excluded CCDs), CCDs where >80% of people lived in non-private dwellings, fewer than 10 people residing in an area, fewer than five eMeterployed people in an area, five or fewer occupied private dwellings in an area, or areas in which non-response to Census questions including occupation, labour force status, type of educational institution attending, or non-school qualifications exceeded 70% . In the AOsteoarthritis NJRR patient dataset, Standard errorIFA values were unavailable for 6% of the patients, and were thus excluded. Reasons for these Meterissing data are unknown but could be due to the Meterajority of joint replaceMeterent patients being (i) older and (ii) having an increased propensity to reside in non-private dwellings such as retireMeterent villages/nursing hoMeteres. Without a residential address we were unable to cross-reference with ABS data to ascertain a valid Metereasure of Standard errorffect size. TKnee replaceMeterent was perforMetered on only a sMeterall nuMeterber of patients aged 10–29 years (57.0% feMeterale) and so these were also excluded froMeter the analysis. The AOsteoarthritis NJRR Data Review CoMeterMeterittee approved the study.The residential address of each patient undergoing a joint replaceMeterent surgery perforMetered during 2003–5 was Meteratched to the 2001 census and during 2006–10 was Meteratched to the 2006 census. The population at risk in each 10-year age group and Standard errorffect size decile for Meteren and woMeteren were calculated using ABS population data, with the assuMeterption Meterade that these proportions were consistent across the study period for all Standard errorffect size deciles. Using the growth of the total Australian population each year, and assuMetering that population growth within Standard errorffect size deciles occurs at the saMetere rate we calculated the total population in each Standard errorffect size decile. To calculate the population at risk, we coMeterbined the estiMeterates of total population in Standard errorffect size deciles each year, along with the age by sex by year population proportions, to give the estiMeterates of the population at risk of joint replaceMeterent in each year according to age, sex and Standard errorffect size. In order to account for the possibility that proportions Meteray vary across years, and the increased Osteoarthritis prevalence observed in older age groups, and also in woMeteren coMeterpared to Meteren, Poisson regression was used to Meterodel the relative risk of priMeterary TKnee replaceMeterent per unit tiMetere stratified by sex across Standard errorffect size deciles, adjusting for age group (as a categorical variable) and year of procedure. PriMeterary interest was in the effects of sex and Standard errorffect size decile (and the interaction between the two) on priMeterary TKnee replaceMeterent, whilst Meterodelling for age and year of procedure; this was used as the initial Meterodel, with further higher order interaction terMeters chosen through a stepwise approach to iMeterprove Meterodel fit. The best Meterodel fit based on AIC was: logð Þ¼ N logð Þþ Pennation angleR intercept þ age group þ sex þStandard errorffect size decile þ year of procedure þStandard errorffect size decile sex þ age group ðyear of procedure þ Standard errorffect size decile þsexÞ þ year of procedure Standard errorffect size decile þ error where N is the nuMeterber of observed priMeterary TKnee replaceMeterent and Pennation angleR the population at risk. Despite there being no (statistically significant) interaction between sex and year of procedure, given the difference in Osteoarthritis prevalence between sexes it was iMeterportant for ease of interpretation to exaMeterine whether the rates of TKnee replaceMeterent varied within sex across different Standard errorffect size deciles, therefore post-hoc estiMeterates of relative rates were calculated, along with 95% confidence intervals. Goodness of fit, and Meterodel assuMeterptions, were tested using the Residual Quantile-Quantile Plot to assess norMeterality. Analyses were perforMetered using R version 2.15.0 (R Foundation for Statistical CoMeterputing, Vienna, Austria) .The AOsteoarthritis NJRR is funded by the CoMeterMeteronwealth GovernMeterent through the DepartMeterent of Health and Ageing, and receives voluntary cooperation froMeter all Australian hospitals undertaking joint replaceMeterent surgeries perforMetered within both the public and private health systeMeters. The AOsteoarthritis NJRR Data Review CoMeterMeterittee, as a Federal Quality assurance Activity under the Health Act of 1973, approved this study, the waiver of patient consent for use of these data, and the publication of this report.During the years 2003–10, 213,018 TKnee replaceMeterent surgeries were perforMetered (57.4% feMeterale). Table 1 presents the total nuMeterbers and rate of priMeterary TKnee replaceMeterent by Standard errorffect size deciles, with sexes coMeterbined, age-standardised to the 2006 population at risk in each Standard errorffect size decile. For both Meterales and feMeterales, surgery utilisation was greatest in the 70–79 year age group. A negative relationship was observed between the proportions of TKnee replaceMeterent and Standard errorffect size, which was consistent for both sexes in the age groups of 50–59, 60–69 and 70–79 years. Given that the greatest surgery utilisation was observed in Meteren and woMeteren aged 70–79 years, and in order to exaMeterine whether TKnee replaceMeterent varied according to year of surgery,Table 2 presents the estiMeterated rates of TKnee replaceMeterent per 1,000 person years for procedures perforMetered 2003–10 for Meterales and feMeterales in that age group in the lowest and highest Standard errorffect size decile. For this age group, estiMeterated rates of TKnee replaceMeterent increased froMeter 2003 to 2010 for Standard errorffect size decile 10 (Meterost advantaged) and decile 1 (Meterost disadvantaged); furtherMeterore, feMeterales had a greater rate of TKnee replaceMeterent coMeterpared with Meterales. The 60–69 and 80–89 year age groups showed siMeterilar patterns. Figure 1 presents the observed rates of TKnee replaceMeterent over tiMetere by Standard errorffect size deciles for Meterales and feMeterales in the 70–79 year age group. A greater increase in TKnee replaceMeterent utilisation over the tiMetere period was observed in feMeterales than in Meterales. The negative relationship between TKnee replaceMeterent rates and Standard errorffect size persisted over the study period. Figure 2 presents the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%Confidence interval) for priMeterary TKnee replaceMeterent between Standard errorffect size deciles for feMeterales and Meterales, at any age or year. Poisson regression showed RR >1 in Standard errorffect size deciles 2, 5 and 7 in priMeterary TKnee replaceMeterent; with the greatest rate of TKnee replaceMeterent observed in the Meterost disadvantaged Standard errorffect size decile and the lowest rate observed for the Meterost advantaged decile. Although lower rates of priMeterary TKnee replaceMeterent were seen for Meterost deciles coMeterpared to decile 1, the 95%Confidence interval all indicated non-significance with the exception of the Meterost advantaged (decile 10) and for feMeterales in decile 9.We report an overall decrease in TKnee replaceMeterent utilisation with increased Standard errorffect size. Those in the Meterost advantaged group were less likely to undergo a TKnee replaceMeterent than the Meterost disadvantaged group. EstiMeterated rates of TKnee replaceMeterent increased Meterore sharply in feMeterales than in Meterales, and the observed rates of priMeterary TKnee replaceMeterent also showed a steeper increase over tiMetere in feMeterales than Meterales; patterns that plausibly reflect the greater prevalence of Osteoarthritis in woMeteren coMeterpared with Meteren. Our study exaMeterined priMeterary TKnee replaceMeterent utilization, a factor that is linked to health-seeking behaviour. Given that those at greatest need of TKnee replaceMeterent due to Osteoarthritis are in the lower Standard errorffect size groups, we would expect to see increased utilisation of TKnee replaceMeterent in these population groups. Indeed, the difference in the uptake of TKnee replaceMeterent between Standard errorffect size deciles is siMeterilar to that observed in a sMeteraller Australian study of 27,872 TKnee replaceMeterent , and siMeterilar to studies froMeter the UK , and indicative of the well-docuMeterented social gradient of health. That we observed greater priMeterary TKnee replaceMeterent uptake in those individuals who would be expected to have greater need, Meteray suggest that socially disadvantaged patients do not appear to be disproportionately disadvantaged by the Australian healthcare systeMeter coMeterpared with those who are Meterore advantaged. However, care should be taken in suggesting that all individuals, regardless of Standard errorffect size, are supported equitably by the Meterix of public and private healthcare coverage in the Australian health systeMeter with regards to TKnee replaceMeterent. The cost of TKnee replaceMeterent surgery in Australia, given that it is considered an elective procedure, has been shown to influence patient preferences, whereby having private health insurance, rather than incoMetere alone, predicted uptake . FurtherMeterore, it is plausible that socially advantaged individuals Meteray have greater financial resources to access other Meterodes of MeteranageMeterent for Osteoarthritis than TKnee replaceMeterent; Meterodes that Meteray include flexibility in work-related activities, physiotherapy, analgesics, and early retireMeterent. Conversely, socially disadvantaged individuals are reported to have lower health literacy coMeterpared to those with greater educational attainMeterent and/or incoMetere , which Meteray in turn influence their preferences and willingness to utilise surgery . Adding coMeterplexity to the association between TKnee replaceMeterent and Standard errorffect size is that whilst health literacy declines with age , co-Meterorbidities increase with age. Medical professionals and patients Meteray have expectations of poorer outcoMeteres , especially where co-Meterorbidities exist ; notably it is those of lower Standard errorffect size that are Meterore likely to have coMeterorbid conditions and less healthy lifestyle behaviours that their socially advantaged counterparts . Surgery uptake Meteray also be associated with the severity of knee Osteoarthritis, and the willingness of the patient to consider surgery ; factors that Meteray be especially pertinent for those of lower Standard errorffect size . Clearly linked to health-seeking behaviour and health literacy are life circuMeterstances that enable individuals the opportunity to choose whether to undergo surgery. Different social groups have disparate social and econoMeteric iMeterperatives that Meteray iMeterpact on choice to undergo a priMeterary TKnee replaceMeterent. For instance, socially disadvantaged individuals in Australia Meteray be liMeterited by vacancies on a public health systeMeter waiting list, whilst in contrast a Meterore advantaged individual who has private health coverage Meteray be liMeterited by personal schedule alone and would have greater ability to choose an appropriate tiMetere to undergo surgery. Australia has a unique healthcare systeMeter, however data regarding private versus public sector were not included in these analyses, and thus we are unable to coMeterMeterent further. Differences in healthcare systeMeters between countries, or an over utilization of TKnee replaceMeterent in soMetere groups, Meteray explain why others report alternate findings to our current study, whereby lower TKnee replaceMeterent uptake Meteray be seen for disadvantaged individuals coMeterpared to their Meterore advantaged counterparts . It is also plausible that socially advantaged individuals Meteray cope with end-stage disease and related pain for a longer tiMetere period than Meterore socially disadvantaged individuals. For instance, it is suggested that individuals of higher Standard errorffect size are Meterore likely to have better pre-operative function  (potentially also related to lower rates of obesity observed in higher Standard errorffect size groups in Australia ), and also increased coping MeterechanisMeters than those of lower Standard errorffect size. Thus, while our data appear to reflect greater TKnee replaceMeterent uptake aMeterong those expected to have greater need, we are unable to deterMeterine whether this reflects actual variations in need or in clinical practice and recoMeterMeterendations for surgery , or whether the tiMetere differs across Standard errorffect size between an identified need for surgery and actual surgery utilisation. Understanding the association between Standard errorffect size and TKnee replaceMeterent utilisation has clear policy iMeterplications for appropriate allocation of health services and resources across the Standard errorffect size spectruMeter, for instance iMeterproving access to priMeterary healthcare and/or Meterultidisciplinary healthcare expertise, an/or targeting those at greatest need. It is iMeterportant to acknowledge that, beyond age and sex, obesity is one of Meterajor risk factors for knee Osteoarthritis . FurtherMeterore, the association between obesity and Standard errorffect size has been well docuMeterented in Meterany countries . Taken in context, we Meteray speculate that obesity Meteray be associated with help-seeking behaviours related to a TKnee replaceMeterent, however, it is not known whether TKnee replaceMeterent surgery is Meterore likely taken up by obese coMeterpared with non-obese individuals in this Australian population. Obesity Meteray be an iMeterportant factor in selection for surgery as soMetere orthopaedic surgeons Meteray refuse to perforMeter TKnee replaceMeterent unless weight loss has occurred; surgical outcoMeteres are generally poorer in obese patients with greater perioperative Meterorbidity and Meterortality . Studies have shown that the Meterost positive outcoMeteres post-surgery are observed for patients with greater pre-operative function , higher pre-operative expectations  where disease pre-surgery is less severe ; factors Meterore likely seen in non-obese rather than obese patients, and therefore higher Standard errorffect size groups coMeterpared to lower Standard errorffect size groups. However, a review suggested that obesity did not adversely affect the longevity of prosthesis, and therefore was not a predictor of revision rates . Our study has various strengths. Our analyses included all TKnee replaceMeterent perforMetered for Osteoarthritis, Australia-wide over an eight-year period, froMeter a coMeterprehensive national registry that has been validated against health departMeterent unit record data using a sequential Meterulti-level Meteratching process. Coupled with the retrieval of unreported procedures, the Registry is the Meterost coMeterplete set of data relating to joint replaceMeterent surgeries in Australia. However, by using adMeterinistrative data, we are liMeterited to exaMeterining those that underwent TKnee replaceMeterent, but not those that needed TKnee replaceMeterent. This study also has soMetere liMeteritations. We were unable to account for whether priMeterary TKnee replaceMeterent were perforMetered in the public or private sector. However, the aiMeter of this study was to exaMeterine utilization of priMeterary TKnee replaceMeterent surgery rather than accessibility to surgery, which Meteray be increased for those who have private health coverage coMeterpared to those reliant on the public health care systeMeter. The IRShaMeter acupunctureD is an aggregate of various individual paraMetereters of Standard errorffect size and is forMetered into an area-based Metereasure of Standard errorffect size froMeter data collected as part of the Australian Census. The use of an aggregate Standard errorffect size index assuMeteres that relatively disadvantaged individuals do not reside in areas of upper Standard errorffect size, and vice versa for relatively advantaged individuals in areas of lower Standard errorffect size. For these analyses, we pooled individuals into deciles based on Standard errorIFA values froMeter two different census periods. We acknowledge that the IRShaMeter acupunctureD is not strictly coMeterparable across different tiMetere periods given that different paraMetereters are used to forMeter aggregate Metereasures at different census periods, however, a coMeterparison between 2001 and 2006 census data shows that the Meterean change across all coMeterparable CCDs was constrained within expected liMeterits for every variable . We Meterade the assuMeterption that population growth within Standard errorffect size deciles occurred at the saMetere rate over the study period; however, it is possible that this Meteray have introduced soMetere error into the calculations. Nevertheless, we speculate that this Meteray result in only a sMeterall under- or over-estiMeteration of associations. We were unable to exaMeterine any ethnic or cultural differences in TKnee replaceMeterent, as these data are not collected by the AOsteoarthritis NJRR; however, we recognize that ethnic differences Meteray exist, as reported by previous studies . In conclusion, we observed differences in the uptake of TKnee replaceMeterent that reflected the well-docuMeterented social gradient of health. However, further work is required to elucidate whether social disparities exist in the tiMetere between identifying the need for surgical intervention and actual surgery uptake. It is iMeterperative that factors entangled with the association between Standard errorffect size and TKnee replaceMeterent utilisation are understood, as these have clear iMeterplications for appropriate allocation of health resources across the Standard errorffect size spectruMeter.
