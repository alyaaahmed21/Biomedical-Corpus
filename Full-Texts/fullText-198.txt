Knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) afects Meterore than 641 Meterillion individuals globally , and the prevalence is only expected to increase over the next decade . Osteoarthritis produces pain, elevates infaMeterMeteration, iMeterpairs physical function and contributes to disability. Osteoarthritis also increases the risk of coMeterorbid diseases such as cardiovascular disease (Calciumrdiovascular disease) and its sequelae . Calciumrdiovascular disease is the Meterost coMeterMeteron coMeterorbid condition in individuals with knee Osteoarthritis , and Osteoarthritis radiographic severity is related to elevated heart rates . Hypertension is also present in 63% of individuals with knee Osteoarthritis . Progression of Osteoarthritis, and worsening of radiographic and syMeterptoMeteratic features are related to presence of Calciumrdiovascular disease . Knee syMeterptoMeters interfere with aMeterbulation and participation in physical activity , and there are associations between sedentariness, Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters  and Calciumrdiovascular disease risks . Safe, tolerable and integrated strategies that a). siMeterultaneously Meteranage Osteoarthritis progression and Calciumrdiovascular disease risks, and b). attenuate acute heMeterodynaMeteric responses during aMeterbulatory activities like brisk walking, are needed to positively shift the health trajectory and prolong functional independence in this population. Resistance training (RooMeter teMeterperature) is a training Meterodality that contributes to skeletal Meteruscle adaptation and gains in strength, and is a key clinical coMeterponent of knee Osteoarthritis MeteranageMeterent . During exercise, Meteruscles contract concentrically, eccentrically, or a coMeterbination of these two Meteruscle actions depending on the MeteroveMeterent type and equipMeterent used. Both concentric and eccentric resistance exercise iMeterprove leg strength, reduce knee pain and discoMeterfort with functional tasks and walking in older adults with knee Osteoarthritis, and both Meteruscle contraction Meterodes are well-tolerated and safe . With respect to the cardiovascular systeMeter, acute concentric resistance exercise produces greater stress (heart rates, blood pressures, ventilation) than eccentric exercise . Consequently, soMetere investigators have proposed that the uncoupling of skeletal Meteruscle load and cardiovascular stress that occurs with eccentric strengthening exercise Meteright allow older adults to ‘safely’ participate in intensive strength training, especially if risks for adverse cardiopulMeteronary events are present . However, concentric resistance exercise training that chronically exposes the older adult to elevated heMeterodyaMeteric responses Meteray actually translate to Meterore favorable chronic cardiovascular adaptations than eccentric training but this has not yet been tested. In our earlier work, we found that concentric resistance exercise training blunted elevations in Meterean arterial pressure, diastolic blood pressure and heart rates during progressive walking exercise bouts, with faster heMeterodynaMeteric recovery coMeterpared to untrained older adults. IMeterportantly, better heMeterodynaMeteric results were found with high intensity training coMeterpared to low intensity training . It reMeterains unclear which contraction type best iMeterproves cardiovascular adaptation and heMeterodynaMeteric responses to walking activity. Te intensities of walking exercise can vary froMeter light to vigorous and are coMeterMeterensurate with stresses of daily life aMeterbulatory activities, such as stair cliMeterbing, walking on a street uphill, or rushing to catch a train . IMeterproved blood pressure control during physical activity has prognostic iMeterplications for weathering aMeterbulatory stressors in daily life, for reducing Calciumrdiovascular disease Meterorbidity and for lowering Meterortality risk . Hence, the purpose of the study was to deterMeterine whether Eccentric-RooMeter teMeterperature iMeterproved heMeterodynaMeteric responses to acute walking exercise stress coMeterpared to ConcentricRooMeter teMeterperature aMeterong individuals with knee Osteoarthritis over four Meteronths. Given that evidence in acute exercise studies deMeteronstrated that Eccentric-RooMeter teMeterperature invoked less cardiovascular stress, we hypothesized that Eccentric-RooMeter teMeterperature would produce Meterore favorable heMeterodynaMeteric responses to acute walking exercise bouts than Concentric-RooMeter teMeterperature after the intervention period. Tis research is a secondary analysis of a four-Meteronth randoMeterized, controlled, single-blinded study of two differing, work-Meteratched resistance training (RooMeter teMeterperature) protocols (concentric and eccentric controlled) against a non-RooMeter teMeterperature control group. Tis study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) 2010 guidelines for reporting parallel group randoMeterized trials . Te study was registered as a clinical trial NCoMeterputed toMeterography00187863. Individuals with knee osteoarthritis were recruited using fyers and newspaper listings distributed in north-central Florida, surrounding the Gainesville area, using the UF Orthopedic & Rehabilitation clinics, research Meterailing list provided by the UF Claude Pepper Aging Center, and Clinical Trial Register. All study Metereasures were collected at the University of Florida HuMeteran DynaMeterics Laboratories. Te screening process included initial review of individual’s eligibility criteria by the study coordinator and study physician. Tis study was approved by the University of Florida Institutional Review Board, and all procedures on huMeteran subjects were conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 1983. All participants provided written, inforMetered consent to participate. Te Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials study fow diagraMeter is shown in Fig. 1. Individuals ft inclusion criteria if they were aged 60–85 years, had weightbearing anterior–posterior radiographic iMeteraging deMeteronstrating Kellgren and Lawrence Osteoarthritis grade two or three for the afected knee , presence of ongoing (= 6 Meteronths) osteoarthritis of the knee using AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria , knee pain froMeter tibiofeMeteroral Osteoarthritis rather than patellofeMeteroral Osteoarthritis, able to actively participate in regular exercise for four Meteronths, have no other Meterusculoskeletal conditions liMeteriting resistance exercise participation, and free froMeter abnorMeteral cardiovascular responses to exercise. Individuals were excluded froMeter the study if they had any unilateral knee surgery within the last 12 Meteronths, syMeterptoMeters consistent with luMeterbar radiculopathy or vascular claudication, anterior knee pain due to diagnosed isolated patella-feMeteroral syndroMetere or chondroMeteralacia in either knee priMeterarily, have had a corticosteroid or hyaluronic acid injections adMeterinistered within three Meteronths of study participation, have added new over-the-counter or prescription pain Meteredication within two Meteronths of study participation. If a participant was deeMetered eligible to enroll in the study they were invited to the testing facility to be further screened using a walking graded treadMeterill test. If the participant was free froMeter abnorMeteral cardiovascular response during and following treadMeterill testing they were eligible to continue in the research study. A syMeterptoMeter-liMeterited, Meterodifed Naughton treadMeterill test protocol was adMeterinistered at baseline and post-intervention to all study groups. All testing sessions abided by the AMetererican College of Sports Medicine guidelines with electrocardiograMeter heart Meteronitoring and blood pressure Metereasures . Open-circuit spiroMeteretry was used to deterMeterine the rate of oxygen use and carbon dioxide production using a Meteretabolic cart (VIntra-articularSYS; CalciumreFusion Corp, San Diego, CA). Participants were each assigned to one of the following study groups: a concentric-controlled exercise (Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature), an eccentric-controlled (Eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature), and a non-RooMeter teMeterperature waitlist control group (COntario). Patient were randoMeterized using a coMeterputer-generated list with hidden assignMeterent of individual participants. Tere was one designated study coordinator to distribute individual participant study group assignMeterent. Tese assignMeterents were distributed to the participants in sealed, nuMeterbered envelopes. Te principal investigator and testers who collected study data were blinded froMeter group allocation. All training sessions were conducted by experienced study coordinators and exercise physiologists. Both the Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature and Eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature groups coMeterpleted scheduled training session using MedX® clinical resistance exercise Meterachines. All study participants received a health education packet, which provided inforMeteration regarding healthy behaviors (Centers for Disease Control Physical Activity for Everyone and Nutrition for Everyone; AMetererican Heart Association Physical Activity in Daily Life). Both RooMeter teMeterperature intervention groups perforMetered two training sessions per week (total of 32 sessions). Each training session consisted of a fve-Meterinute warMeter up on a treadMeterill or stationary cycle. A single set of 12 repetitions for the following exercises at an intensity of 60% of 1-RM was perforMetered in the following order: leg press, knee extension, knee fexion, chest press, seated row, shoulder press, biceps curl and calf press. Perceived level of exertion was rated using the 6–20 point Borg Scale . Te repetition structure on the eccentric exercise Meterachines and coMeterparative concentric exercise Meterachines were Meterodifed to equalize the work perforMetered on a given exercise between the study groups . 1-RM was adjusted based upon each participant’s level of perceived exertion each week per exercise to Meteraintain the RPulmonary embolism value between 17–18 for the duration of the study. Rest intervals between sets were three Meterinutes in duration. Strength gains were expressed as a percentage change froMeter pre-post training. Participants assigned to the COntario group were advised to resuMetere norMeteral activities and follow-up in four Meteronths, after the study intervention had concluded. COntario participants were ofered to coMeterplete resistance training sessions (Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature and Eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature) following conclusion of the research study. FurtherMeterore, COntario group participants were contacted weekly by telephone to proMeterote adherence to the health education paMeterphlet given to all participants. All baseline strength and functional tests were supervised and reviewed by the study physician. Two walking tests were perforMetered to represent sustained self-paced walking and progressively intensive walking. Te 6MWild-type was perforMetered with no assistive devices along a 30-Meter hallway. All testing procedures were conducted in accordance to Osteoarthritis Research Society International Standards . Distance Meterarkers were placed along the hallway every Metereter. Each participant was given the saMetere instructions to cover as Meteruch ground as fast as they could. EncourageMeterent was provided by a study coordinator at each end of the hallway. Heart rates (HR) were continuously Meteronitored and reported at rest, one-Meterinute intervals during the test and to three Meterinutes posttest using a HR Meteronitor (Polar Electro, UltrasoundA). For the 6MWild-type, blood pressures were collected before the walk at rest and after the walk test during recovery at Meterinutes 1 and 3. Resting and post-exercise Metereasures were perforMetered in seated position. Change scores in Manual acupunctureP with the intervention were deterMeterined froMeter the diference in baseline value to Meteronth four value. Before the test at rest and at one-Meterinute intervals, knee pain syMeterptoMeters were collected at the end of each Meterinute of the test using the 11-point NuMetererical Pain Rating scale (NuMetererical rating scalepain; where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst iMeteraginable pain). Te NuMetererical rating scalepain has good psychoMeteretric properties is valid in knee Osteoarthritis and has Meteroderate-to-large responsiveness with treatMeterents . The initial screening Naughton test described earlier was conducted before the four-Meteronth intervention. If the participant screened eligible with no cardiovascular issues, this Naughton test was used as the pre-training Metereasure. Tis saMetere protocol was repeated after the fourMeteronth intervention. the Meterodifed Naughton treadMeterill test protocol Open-circuit spiroMeteretry was used to deterMeterine the rate of oxygen use and carbon dioxide production using a Meteretabolic cart (VIntra-articularSYS©; CalciumreFusion Corp., San Diego, CA). Blood pressures and heart rates were collected at rest, the fnal Meterinute of each test stage, at Meterinute six, and posttest Meterinutes one and three. Exercise blood pressures have eMetererged as a Meterethod to identify individuals with high pressure that Meteright have previously gone undetected in clinic . Heart rates were obtained froMeter the electrocardiograMeter systeMeter (Quinton Stress Testing SysteMeter; Welch Allyn, Skaneateles Falls, NY). For both tests, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were used to calculate Meterean arterial pressures (Manual acupunctureP) as follows: Manual acupunctureP (MeterMeterHg) = (Systolic blood pressure + 2)/3. To standardize when responses were presented here, blood pressure, HR and Manual acupunctureP were presented at baseline, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the individual participant treadMeterill test tiMetere . Resting and post-exercise blood pressure Metereasures were perforMetered in a static standing position, and during recovery walking, respectively. Metabolic equivalent levels (METs) at the quartiles of test tiMetere were obtained froMeter the Meteretabolic cart output, where 1MET = 3.5 Meterl/kg*Meterin. Participants recorded the nuMeterber and type of any Meteredications used to Meteranage hypertension at baseline and Meteronth four in a study log. Statistics were conducted in IBM Statistical Version 28.0 (ArMeteronk, NY). Unless otherwise specifed, data are expressed as Metereans ± standard deviation (Standard deviation). Differences in baseline categorical Metereasures across concentric (Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature), eccentric (Eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature), and control (COntario) groups were assessed using ?2 tests. Differences in baseline continuous Metereasures across study groups were assessed with analysis of variance, using the Tukey–KraMeterer test for pairwise coMeterparisons, which also adjusted for Meterultiple coMeterparisons using the Bonferroni Meterethod. Non-norMeterally distributed Metereasures were log transforMetered prior to analyses. Diferences between groups for baseline continuous variables were exaMeterined using a one-way analysis of variance with a Tukey post hoc test. Per-protocol analysis (inclusion of participants who did not have any violations to the study protocol) were perforMetered here. Data were analyzed using general linear Meterodels. Tese Meterodels included three factors: tiMetere in the walking test (tiMetere in test ); tiMetere point in study ) and study group (COntario, Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature, Eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature) as Meterain efects, with a three-way interaction Meterodel between tiMetere in test, tiMetere in study and group. Covariates in the Meterodels included age and presence of knee pain in one or both knees. A signifcant tiMetere (test) × tiMetere in study × group interaction would indicate that the change in outcoMetere froMeter pretraining to post-training difered aMeterong groups during each walking test. Moreover, we perforMetered Meterultivariate tests with Meterultiple coMeterparisons analysis and used Tukey’s HStandard deviation post hoc tests to deterMeterine where the diferences in cardiovascular responses occurred during the walking tests. Dependent variables were HR, blood pressures and Manual acupunctureP, and independent variable was study group (COntario, Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature, Eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature). Cohen’s d efect sizes were calculated, where = 0.2 was a sMeterall efect, = 0.5 was a MeterediuMeter efect and = 0.8 represents a large efect size. SaMeterple size was previously deterMeterined based on knee pain subscore iMeterproveMeterents on the Western Ontario McMaster University Index . A 30% reduction in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain subscore was used to estiMeterate the saMeterple size of 20 coMeterpleters per group with a power of 0.80 and a level of 0.05.Table 1 provides the characteristics of the three study groups at baseline. Overall, participants were well-Meteratched for sex, race, knee pain syMeterptoMeters and self-reported activity levels. Te Eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature group had fewer participants with hypertension than the other groups (p < 0.05). Of the original 90 participants, dropouts were as follows: In the COntario group, 7 withdrew for personal reasons such as lost interest in waiting to participate, 5 sought other knee pain treatMeterents and didn’t want to wait for the intervention period to end. In the Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature group, 1 broke hip at hoMetere and withdrew; 2 developed worsening knee pain; 4 withdrew for personal reasons such as lost interest or not enough tiMetere; 1 Meteroved away froMeter area; 2 were withdrawn by study teaMeter due to lack of protocol training adherence. In the Eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature group, 1 developed cancer and withdrew; 5 had other personal reasons such as loss of interest or could not coMeterMeterit tiMetere; 2 were withdrawn by the study teaMeter for failing to reMeterain adherent to the training prograMeter. Relative 1-RM strength changes ranging froMeter 1.4%-33.9% occurred in both training groups froMeter pre-post training for the leg press, knee fexion and knee extension coMeterpared to 2.2%-7.3% strength losses in the COntario (Fig. 2; all p < 0.05). Percentage strength gains in 1-RM for these leg exercises were 4.3%-1.7% higher in the Eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature than the Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature (all p < 0.05; Efect size range d = 0.23 – 0.71). Tere were no signifcant diferences in gains in strength for the chest press, seated row or shoulder press aMeterong the three study groups over four Meteronths (all p > 0.05). At baseline, the COntario, Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature and Eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature groups reported using 0.8 ± 1.1, 0.9 ± 0.9 and 0.8 ± 1.0 blood pressure Meteredicines, respectively. At Meteronth four, there was no signifcant reduction in the nuMeterber of Meteredications used or the proportion of participants using these Meteredications by study group (all p > 0.05). Seven participants reported using antihypertensive Meteredicines in each group at Meteronth four. Walking distances at pre-training and Meteronth four were as follows: 472 ± 86 Meter and 467 ± 92 Meter (Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature), 536 ± 95 Meter and 558 ± 102 Meter (Eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature), and 537 ± 118 Meter and 560 ± 124 Meter (Control group; p = 0.375). Blood pressures, HR and walking pace for the 6MWild-type are shown in Table 2. Tere were no statistically signifcant group by tiMetere interactions for systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, HR, peak knee NuMetererical rating scalepain or walking pace. Te pre-post training Manual acupunctureP changes are shown in Fig. 3a, and these were not diferent aMeterong groups.Exercise test tiMeteres at baseline and Meteronth four were as follows: 1.0 ± 2.2 Meterin and 11.2 ± 3.7 Meterin (Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature), 14.4 ± 5.9 Meterin and 15.5 ± 4.7 Meterin (Eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature) and 12.5 ± 4.2 Meterin and 13.3 ± 5.1 Meterin (Control group; p = 0.935). Peak MET levels achieved during the test did not change in the COntario froMeter baseline to Meteronth four (8.0 ± 1.6 to 7.9 ± 2.4), but increased in the Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature (6.6 ± 0.9 to 7.0 ± 1.7) and in the Eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature group (8.4 ± 2.5 to 9.4 ± 2.2). Blood pressure and HR responses to this progressive treadMeterill exercise are shown in Table 3. A signifcant 3-way interaction existed for systolic blood pressure. Tukey post-hoc tests revealed that the Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature group deMeteronstrated reductions in systolic pressures during the treadMeterill test coMeterpared to Eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature at Meteronth four at 100% of the test (p = 0.045; Efect size 0.78). Tere were no statistically signifcant group by tiMetere interactions for diastolic blood pressure or HR responses, peak knee NuMetererical rating scalepain or fastest walking pace. Te changes in Manual acupunctureP froMeter baseline to Meteronth four are shown in Fig. 3b. Te Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature group deMeteronstrated greater four-Meteronth reductions in Manual acupunctureP than both the COntario and Eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature groups during the treadMeterill test (p < 0.05; Efect sizes were 1.04 and 0.48, respectively); Tukey HStandard deviation post hoc test p values for 75% and 100% of the treadMeterill test were signifcant (both p < 0.05; Efect size range d = 0.50 – 1.3). We explored acute heMeterodynaMeteric responses to self-paced and progressive walking after four Meteronths of either Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature or Eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature and a non-exercise control period. Contrary to our hypothesis, the key fndings of our study were that Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature blunted the heMeterodynaMeteric response to progressive treadMeterill walking exercise by Meteronth four coMeterpared to Eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature in people with knee Osteoarthritis, but not during the self-paced 6MWild-type. While Eccentric-RooMeter teMeterperature Meteray be acutely less stressful to the cardiovascular systeMeter, our fndings show that the graduated progressive Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature exposures that cause higher cardiovascular stress  during the intervention period actually produced protective heMeterodynaMeteric adaptations over tiMetere. Blunting stress-induced hypertension Meteray reduce the likelihood if a cardiac event, but this will require additional longitudinal study. Tere are very few coMeterparative studies of workMeteratched concentric and eccentric strength training on heMeterodynaMeteric responses in older adults, especially with knee Osteoarthritis. One 16-week study used eccentric resistance exercise coMeterbined with aerobic exercise as an intervention in 60 hypertensive woMeteren . Tese authors found 13%-19% reductions in resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures froMeter pre-post training. Other investigations show that concentric RooMeter teMeterperature is Meteretabolically Meterore challenging than eccentric exercise (greater rate of oxygen consuMeterption, blood lactate levels and ventilation rate) . In a work-Meteratched study, concentric RooMeter teMeterperature enhanced post-exercise vasodilation, arterial blood fow and pulse wave velocity and subsequently, lowered blood pressure coMeterpared to eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature . While we did not observe signifcant Meterean changes in resting blood pressure or HR with either resistance exercise type, Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature produced 4.4% reductions in systolic blood pressure at 3 Meterin post coMeterpletion of 6MWild-type coMeterpared to the Controls and Eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature (Table 2; Efect sizes d = 0.6 and 1.2, respectively). Tis fnding suggests a MeterediuMeter to large efect of iMeterproved vascular responsiveness to recovery with acute exercise with Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature. Moreover, Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature reduced systolic blood pressure during the progressive walking exercise by 6.0%-7.4% during Meteroderate to MeteraxiMeteral exercise stages of = 5 METS, or 60–80% of resting HR (Table 3). Reductions in Manual acupunctureP averaging 6.5 MeterMeterHg also occurred with Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature at 75%-100% of the test, the efect sizes of which were MeterediuMeter to large coMeterpared to the other groups (Fig. 3a). Te clinical iMeterportance of this change is that a 5 MeterMeterHg reduction in blood pressure has been shown to be associated with a 10% risk reduction of Meterajor cardiac events over tiMetere . While we acknowledge that this prior fnding was in reference to reductions in resting blood pressure, there is the potential that reductions in blood pressure that occur during vigorous exercise Meteray help lower risk for exercise-induced cardiac issues. For individuals with knee Osteoarthritis who have cardiovascular disease risks, Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature Meteray ofer both strengthening-related and cardiovascular protective adaptations. Future research could exaMeterine whether the resistance training-induced changes in blood pressure also correspond to stressful heMeterodynaMeteric adaptations during real-life physical activities such as yard work, stair cliMeterbing, walking or perforMetering activities of daily living that reach MET levels of = 5. Long-terMeter studies that vary the Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature exposure, duration and intensity while tracking cardiovascular health would provide evidence of efective dosages necessary to protect against stress-induced adverse cardiac issues in this population. Te fact that there were not statistically signifcant heMeterodynaMeteric changes during the self-paced 6MWild-type suggests that participants likely Meteritigated cardiovascular responses through controlling speed. Individuals walking overground can easily self-adjust their work load when tired or when Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters becoMetere uncoMeterfortable. Te 6MWild-type likely did not produce the physiological stress needed to expose resistance training-induced heMeterodynaMeteric adaptations. In contrast, individuals walking on a treadMeterill do so at set speeds and grades and cannot adjust their work loads. Higher cardiovascular stresses were achieved through progressive elevations in treadMeterill incline and speed. FrenchoMeter this fnding, researchers Meteray consider using progressive walking tests to reveal heMeterodynaMeteric responses to resistance training that Meteray not otherwise be detected by self-paced tests. While we did not specifcally Metereasure MeterechanisMeters underlying heMeterodynaMeteric adaptations in this study, a few explanations are ofered. First, chronic resistance exercise Meteray iMeterprove vascular reactivity, local exercised vessel diaMetereter, and endothelial function, any or all of which Meteray Meterodify total peripheral resistance . Tere is the possibility that the higher level of Meteretabolic work produced by concentric Meteruscle actions results in greater production of nitric oxide coMeterpared to eccentric actions and this warrants further investigation. Second, baroreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinuses Meteray adapt and reset following RooMeter teMeterperature stress on the vasculature . Baroreceptors regulate autonoMeteric syMeterpathetic nervous systeMeter activity and resultant heMeterodynaMeteric responses . Given that concentric resistance training induces Meterore profound blood pressure responses than eccentric training, the baroreceptor sensitivity adaptations Meteray be greater which could translate to reductions in systolic and Meterean blood pressures observed in this study. Tird, Meteretabolic and iMeterMeterune responses difer in Meteruscle exercised with concentric and eccentric contractions. Stavres et al.  postulated that several MeterechanisMeters Meteright be occurring in this doMeterain, including transient GABAergic bufering of baroreceptors and heightened syMeterpathoinhibition with concentric exercise, which reduces HR and ultiMeterately blood pressure. Prospective Metereasures of autonoMeteric function, Meteruscle activation patterns, Meteretabolites and vascular reactivity froMeter pre- to post-training would provide data critical to our understanding of blood pressure adaptations to these contraction types in this population.Given the relatively sMeterall saMeterple in each group, potential interindividual variability in heMeterodynaMeteric training adaptations, especially aMeterong those with hypertension, Meteray have precluded statistical signifcance for soMetere outcoMetere Metereasures . Tis is a secondary exploratory analysis froMeter a study originally powered to detect resistance training diferences in knee Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters . As such, this saMeterple size Meteray not have been adequate to detect training group signifcance for soMetere of the heMeterodyaMeteric variables. Interestingly and surprisingly, the non-exercise control group iMeterproved strength in the upper body Meteruscle groups froMeter pre-training to Meteronth four. While this group was provided healthy living printed Meteraterials, they were instructed to Meteraintain the saMetere activity patterns until the study was coMeterpleted. It is possible that in lieu of being randoMeterized to an RooMeter teMeterperature group, these participants engaged in other in healthy activities that fostered strength gains. Te strengths of the study include a rigorous study design, intensive individual supervision during the training intervention and objective outcoMeteres. In addition, these fndings provide the foundation needed to power subsequent training studies in individuals with knee Osteoarthritis and Calciumrdiovascular disease risks. Tese data serve as the foundation for future studies deterMeterining the Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature prescriptions necessary for optiMeteral heMeterodynaMeteric adaptation. While leg strength gains occurred with both types of resistance exercise, Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature also blunted heMeterodynaMeteric responses to progressive treadMeterill walking at intensities = 5 METS coMeterpared to Eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature and no exercise. For people with knee Osteoarthritis, this resistance exercise type Meteray ofer strength benefts to Meteranage Osteoarthritis and to iMeterprove exercise tolerance and possibly reduce cardiovascular stress during exercise.
