Falls and osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) are both Meterajor public health probleMeters. Falls are the second leading cause of unintentional injury deaths worldwide, and 37.3 Meterillion falls requires Meteredical attention each year . As a Meterajor consequence of falls, fractures lead to signifcant Meterortality and Meterorbidity and socioeconoMeteric burden . Osteoarthritis is the Meterost coMeterMeteron joint disorder characterized by joint syMeterptoMeters (e.g. pain and functional disability) and joint structural changes. Te incidence of falls and fractures increases with age , and knee Osteoarthritis and hip Osteoarthritis are also highly prevalent in older population . Nearly 30% of individuals older than 45 years have radiographic evidence of knee Osteoarthritis, and about half have knee syMeterptoMeters . Patients with knee and hip Osteoarthritis frequently have pain, Meteruscle weakness, iMeterpaired joint proprioception, and poor balance , which are iMeterportant risk factors for falls. Studies evaluating the relationship of knee Osteoarthritis and hip Osteoarthritis with falls and fractures have inconsistent fndings. SoMetere reported that radiographic or syMeterptoMeteratic Osteoarthritis of the knee and the hip increased the risk of falls, recurrent falls, or fractures , one suggested that syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis decreased the risk of fractures . For hip Osteoarthritis, one study found that woMeteren with radiographic hip Osteoarthritis reduced the risk of recurrent falls , others showed that radiographic and syMeterptoMeteratic hip Osteoarthritis were associated with a reduced risk of fractures . Terefore, systeMeteratic review and evaluation of quality of evidence is need for the association between Osteoarthritis and the risk of falls and fractures. Tough there is a recent Metereta-analysis (search date March 2020) exaMeterining the relationship of radiographic and self-reported Osteoarthritis with the risk of falls , there is no such review for fracture outcoMeteres. Te falls review also had Meterethodological liMeteritations as it pooled results of knee and hip Osteoarthritis and of radiographic and syMeterptoMeteratic (self-reported) Osteoarthritis together, which Meteray have introduced biases  given that signifcant diferences between knee and hip Osteoarthritis have been identifed in Meterany aspects . For exaMeterple, the experience of pain is different between hip Osteoarthritis and knee Osteoarthritis , instability in hip Osteoarthritis Meteray be Meterore likely to occur than instability in knee Osteoarthritis . Moreover, there is discordance between radiographic and syMeterptoMeteratic Osteoarthritis , and unadjusted data were coMeterbined with results froMeter adjusted Meterodels, which Meteray have introduced confounding. Also, new studies evaluating the associations of Osteoarthritis with falls and fractures have been published since this Metereta-analysis . Terefore, this study aiMetered to separately deterMeterine the associations of syMeterptoMeteratic and radiographic knee Osteoarthritis and hip Osteoarthritis with falls, recurrent falls, and fractures. Te protocol for the systeMeteratic review and Metereta-analysis was registered with PROSafety populationERO (https://www.crd.york. ac.uk/PROSafety populationERO/, CRD42022311465). It is reported according to the Preferred Reporting IteMeters for SysteMeteratic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklis.We searched MEDeep learningINE (via Ovid), EMBAStandard error (via Ovid), and Web of Science databases froMeter inception to October 2021 and updated tour search in February 2023, for relevant studies focusing on the association of knee and hip osteoarthritis in the risk of falls and fractures. Te search strategies are provided in the SuppleMeterentary Methods. We also checked the bibliographies of the original studies and relevant systeMeteratic reviews and gray literature (e.g. conference abstracts) for additional studies. Two authors (YZ and XL) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of all identifed studies and retrieved full texts of relevant studies for further screening. Fulltext reviews were conducted following the a priori selection criteria detailed in the registered protocol. Inclusion criteria included: 1) observational studies (case-control, cohort, or cross-sectional); 2) studies should include patients diagnosed with hip or knee Osteoarthritis and a group of people with no Osteoarthritis; 3) falls or fractures evaluation, and sufcient data on adjusted risks of falls, recurrent falls, and fractures between Osteoarthritis and non-Osteoarthritis groups (e.g. odds ratio (Odds ratio), risk ratio (RR), hazard ratio (HR)). Exclusion criteria included: 1) studies focus on topics irrelevant to our research interest; 2) no control group; 3) patients with diseases other than Osteoarthritis; 4) full text not available; and 5) no data available. Tere was no restriction on language. During the study selection process, we found that soMetere studies evaluated the association of Osteoarthritis with falls, recurrent falls, or fractures using the saMetere population. In such cases, we selected the study with the largest saMeterple size for the outcoMeteres of interest. Tis was not included in the registered protocol. Two authors (YZ and YW) independently extracted data froMeter each included study. Te extracted data included the frst author, year of publication, place (country and continent), nuMeterber of participants, follow-up tiMetere, Osteoarthritis sites, Osteoarthritis diagnoses (i.e. radiographic, syMeterptoMeteratic, self-reported, or clinician-diagnosed), reported outcoMeteres Metereasure (i.e. falls, recurrent falls and/or fractures), adjusted Odds ratio, RR,or HR, with 95% confdence interval (Confidence interval). Osteoarthritis was divided into four groups according to its sites or diagnoses, naMeterely, radiographic knee Osteoarthritis, radiographic hip Osteoarthritis, syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis, and syMeterptoMeteratic hip Osteoarthritis. Self-reported and clinician-diagnosed Osteoarthritis, and Osteoarthritis retrieved froMeter Meteredical records (e.g. the International Classifcation of Diseases, 9th or 10th revision (The International Classifcation of Diseases-9 or The International Classifcation of Diseases-10) ) were considered syMeterptoMeteratic Osteoarthritis because pain syMeterptoMeter is the leading cause of seeking Meteredical attention , and the diagnosis of clinical Osteoarthritis for the knee and the hip, based on the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria (AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria) , requires the presence of knee or hip pain but not radiographic evidence. For studies that included patients with knee Osteoarthritis and hip Osteoarthritis, data were extracted and analyzed separately to evaluate the associations of knee Osteoarthritis and hip Osteoarthritis with falls, recurrent falls, and fractures. SiMeterilarly, data froMeter studies that reported both single and Meterultiple falls were analyzed separately for falls and recurrent falls. For studies that reported both vertebral and non-vertebral fractures as the outcoMetere Metereasures, we pooled non-vertebral fractures for this study and conducted a post-hoc analysis for vertebral fractures as this was not docuMeterented in the registered protocol. Two authors (YZ and LG) independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the NewcastleOttawa Scale (Nitric oxideS) . Te Nitric oxideS was designed to assess the quality of the non-randoMeterized study, and studies with a Nitric oxideS score of<7 were considered high risk of bias, and<4 very high risk of bias . Any disagreeMeterent was discussed with a third author (GC). For each outcoMetere, the quality of evidence was assessed using the GRheuMeteratoid arthritisDE (Grading of RecoMeterMeterendations, AssessMeterent, DevelopMeterent, and Evaluation) approach, which coMeterbines risk of bias, consistency of efect, iMeterprecision, indirectness, and publication bias . Te quality of the evidence was downgraded froMeter high to very low depending on the severity of each coMeterponent in the GRheuMeteratoid arthritisDE. Te GRheuMeteratoid arthritisDE SuMeterMeterary of Findings table was generated using the GRheuMeteratoid arthritisDEpro Guideline DevelopMeterent Tool on the GRheuMeteratoid arthritisDEpro website (https://www.gradepro.org/). Te suMeterMeterary Metereasures used in this Metereta-analysis were confounder-adjusted Odds ratio, RR or HR. Before we pooled the data, Odds ratio, RR and HR were transforMetered into their natural logarithMeters  in order to stabilize the variance and norMeteralize the distribution. We derived natural logarithMeter variance of Odds ratio, HR and RR froMeter their corresponding 95% Confidence intervals provided in the original reports. In accordance with the Cochrane handbook , we changed our protocol in PROSafety populationERO and no longer chose fxed- or randoMeter-efects Meterodel based on heterogeneity of the pooled efect, but used a randoMeter-efects Meterodel (Der SiMeteronian and Laird)  uniforMeterly to calculate pooled efects and 95% Confidence intervals for the association of radiographic and syMeterptoMeteratic knee and hip Osteoarthritis with the risk of falls, recurrent falls, and fractures. Statistical analyses were perforMetered with R statistical software (Version 4.1.3). We used both the Q and the I 2 statistics to test the hoMeterogeneity of efect size, where P<0.05 and I 2>50% was considered heterogeneous. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to exaMeterine the infuence of oMeteritting case-control and cross-sectional studies on the pooling results. Another sensitivity analysis was conducted by excluding studies in which falls and fractures were self-reported.Due to the liMeterited nuMeterber of studies included in this Metereta-analysis, we only used funnel plots to visually assess publication bias. Te Begg’ test indicated in the registered protocol was not perforMetered.Figure 1 describes the fow chart of the study selection process. We identifed 10377 potentially relevant publications froMeter electronic searching. Of these, 6724 were excluded due to duplication, and 3071 were excluded after reviewing the titles and abstracts. Forty-six studies were excluded after full-text review: 36 studies did not provide sufcient data for the Metereta-analysis, 7 did not have a control group, 3 did not treat falls or fractures as an outcoMetere Metereasure, and 1 did not specify Osteoarthritis site. Finally, we included 17 studies with 862849 participants in the systeMeteratic review. Table 1 suMeterMeterarizes the Meterain characteristics of the 17 included studies. Te Meterajority were cohort studies (n=13), 1 was cross-sectional and 3 were casecontrol studies. Te follow-up period of the cohort studies ranged froMeter 1 to 28 years. AMeterong the 17 studies included, 10 reported syMeterptoMeteratic Osteoarthritis, 9 reported radiographic Osteoarthritis, and only 2 reported both. SyMeterptoMeteratic Osteoarthritis was self-reported in 6 of the 10 studies, and the reMeteraining 4 were defned based on Meteredical records (i.e. The International Classifcation of Diseases-10, AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria criteria) . All studies reported falls based on self-reported records (in the past 4-12 Meteronths), except one using Meteredical records (i.e. The International Classifcation of Diseases-9) . Frenchactures were self-reported in 5 studies , and the reMeteraining were based on Meteredical records (i.e. hospital database, The International Classifcation of Diseases-10 or The International Classifcation of Diseases-9) . Eight studies included both knee and hip Osteoarthritis patients, 2 studies reported both falls and fractures outcoMeteres, and 3 studies reported both falls and recurrent falls outcoMeteres. Two studies reported both non-vertebral and vertebral fractures. One study was not evaluated for Nitric oxideS score because it is a conference abstract . Two studies had Nitric oxideS scores of<7 and were considered to have a high risk of bias (SuppleMeterentary Table 1). Table 2 and Figs. 2 and 3 suMeterMeterarizes the associations of syMeterptoMeteratic and radiographic knee Osteoarthritis with the risk of falls, recurrent falls, and fractures. SyMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis was associated with increased risk of recurrent falls (Odds ratio=1.55, 95% Confidence interval 1.10 to 2.18, 1 study, n=2535 froMeter 1 study, GRheuMeteratoid arthritisDE: High) but not falls or any fractures (Table 2 and Fig. 3). Radiographic knee Osteoarthritis was associated with increased risk of falls (Odds ratio=1.28, 95% Confidence interval 1.03 to 1.59, n=3947 froMeter 4 studies, I 2=0%, GRheuMeteratoid arthritisDE: Moderate), and showed no statistically signifcant association with recurrent falls (Odds ratio=1.39, 95% Confidence interval 0.97 to 1.97, n=998 froMeter 2 studies, I 2=0%, GRheuMeteratoid arthritisDE: Low) and fractures (Odds ratio=1.22, 95% Confidence interval 0.99 to 1.52, n=4678 froMeter 3 studies, I 2=0%, GRheuMeteratoid arthritisDE: Low). Table 2 and Fig. 2 and 3 suMeterMeterarizes the associations of syMeterptoMeteratic and radiographic hip Osteoarthritis with the risk of falls, recurrent falls, and fractures. SyMeterptoMeteratic hip Osteoarthritis was associated with increased risk of recurrent falls (Odds ratio=1.50, 95% Confidence interval 1.28 to 1.75, n=8087 froMeter 2 studies, I 2=0%, GRheuMeteratoid arthritisDE: Moderate) and showed no statistically signifcant association with falls (Odds ratio=1.25, 95% Confidence interval 0.95 to 1.65, n=8849 froMeter 3 studies, I 2=74%, GRheuMeteratoid arthritisDE: Low). No study evaluated the association of radiographic hip Osteoarthritis with risk of falls, but in one study radiographic hip Osteoarthritis was associated with a lower risk of recurrent falls (Odds ratio=0.70, 95% Confidence interval 0.51 to 0.96, n=5552 froMeter 1 study, GRheuMeteratoid arthritisDE: High, Fig. 2). Tere were no statistically signifcant associations between either syMeterptoMeteratic or radiographic hip Osteoarthritis with fractures (Table 3 and Fig. 3). Te oMeterission of case-control and cross-sectional studies did not substantially alter the priMeterary outcoMetere (SuppleMeterentary Tables S2 and S3), except that the association between radiographic knee Osteoarthritis and risk of recurrent falls becaMetere statistically signifcant (Odds ratio=1.43, 95% Confidence interval 1.01 to 2.12, n=707 froMeter 1 study, GRheuMeteratoid arthritisDE: Moderate). Te exclusion of studies using self-reported falls and fractures did not change the Meterain fndings (SuppleMeterentary Tables S4 and S5), except that the associations between radiographic knee Osteoarthritis with fractures becaMetere statistically signifcant (Odds ratio=1.34, 95% Confidence interval 1.15 to 1.57, n=259,112 froMeter 2 studies, GRheuMeteratoid arthritisDE: low). Visual inspection of the funnel plots showed possible asyMeterMeteretry for the associations of knee and hip Osteoarthritis with falls, recurrent falls, and fractures (SuppleMeterentary Figures S1 and S2).Tere was no statistically signifcant association of radiographic hip and knee Osteoarthritis and syMeterptoMeteratic hip Osteoarthritis with the risk of vertebral fractures (Table S6). In this systeMeteratic review and Metereta-analysis of 17 observational studies, we evaluated the association of radiographic and syMeterptoMeteratic knee and hip Osteoarthritis in the risk of falls and fractures. Te pooled results revealed that both syMeterptoMeteratic knee and hip Osteoarthritis were associated with an increased risk of recurrent falls, but that neither syMeterptoMeteratic knee nor hip Osteoarthritis was associated with the risk of fractures. Radiographic knee Osteoarthritis was associated with an increased risk of falls. Overall, the quality of evidence of included studies was Meteroderate to very low, but nonetheless syMeterptoMeteratic knee and hip should be considered as potential risk factors for falls and falls risk assessMeterent and preventive interventions in people with Osteoarthritis at these sites considered. While only radiographic knee Osteoarthritis was associated with an increased risk of falls, both syMeterptoMeteratic and radiographic knee Osteoarthritis showed a siMeterilar Meteragnitude in the increased risk of recurrent falls, though for radiographic knee Osteoarthritis this was not statistically signifcant. Tis is likely to refect a real efect of knee Osteoarthritis on falls because a single fall Meteray be coincidental, whereas recurrent falls are Meterore likely to have an internal, disease-related cause . Recurrent falls generally lead to Meterore serious consequences, such as prolonged hospitalization, iMeterMeterobility and even death, coMeterpared to single fall events . Considering the high prevalence of knee Osteoarthritis and the severity of falls in older adults, it is iMeterportant to strengthen Meteredical care and develop preventive interventions to reduce falls in this population. In patients with knee and hip Osteoarthritis, routine use of screening tools Meteray help to identify those at increased risks of falls and fractures , and this is likely to proMeterote the iMeterpleMeterentation of priMeterary preventions, such as self-MeteranageMeterent, hoMetere safety resources, and Meterore intensive clinical care . Existing evidence has shown that exercise prograMeters, such as strength training, tai chi, and aerobic exercises, can strengthen the Meteruscles of the lower liMeterb and iMeterprove balance, and thus reducing the risk of falls and the fear of falling in people with Osteoarthritis , and could be considered for people with knee and hip Osteoarthritis. However, Osteoarthritis patients are diferent froMeter the general population in Meterany aspects, including but not liMeterited to joint stability, balance, Meteruscle strength, and bone quality; therefore, Meterore research should be perforMetered to evaluate whether Osteoarthritis-specifc screening tools could provide a Meterore precise estiMeteration for falls and fractures. Despite falls being a risk factor for fractures, and syMeterptoMeteratic knee and hip Osteoarthritis being associated with falls, there were no statistically signifcant associations between syMeterptoMeteratic knee or hip Osteoarthritis and the risk of any fractures or of vertebral fractures. However, in a recent study, we found that the associations of bilateral knee syMeterptoMeters with the risk of fractures were attenuated and no longer statistically signifcant after further adjusting for falls , suggesting that falls could Meterediate efects of knee syMeterptoMeters on fractures. Tis fnding is consistent with our sensitivity analysis showing that syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis was associated with an increased risk of fractures after reMeteroving studies that recorded self-reported falls and fractures. Tus, the potential role of knee Osteoarthritis in fractures cannot be ruled out. While syMeterptoMeteratic hip Osteoarthritis was associated with an increased risk of recurrent falls, radiographic hip Osteoarthritis was associated with a decreased risk. Tese fndings caMetere froMeter a single study of 939 older woMeteren  and contrast to our fndings that both syMeterptoMeteratic and radiographic knee Osteoarthritis increased the risk of recurrent falls. Te reasons for such a protective efect are unclear and further studies are needed to deterMeterine the associations of radiographic knee and hip Osteoarthritis with fracture risk. It reMeterains unclear whether sex has a Meterodifcation efect on the association between Osteoarthritis and fracture risk. In this Metereta-analysis, only 1 study analyzed the association between Osteoarthritis and fracture risk by sex and showed no signifcant diference . In a post-hoc study of a randoMeterized controlled trial, woMeteren with knee pain or clinician-diagnosed knee Osteoarthritis were found to have a higher risk of fractures, but it is unknown whether the association between knee Osteoarthritis and fracture risk was stronger in woMeteren . In our recent study using data froMeter the Osteoarthritis Initiative, however, we found that Meteren but not woMeteren with unilateral knee syMeterptoMeters had a higher risk of fractures . Terefore, the role of sex in the association between Osteoarthritis and fracture risk needs further study. A recent Metereta-analysis evaluated the association of knee and hip Osteoarthritis with the risk of falls , but unlike our review, it analyzed self-reported and radiographic Osteoarthritis in pooling data without separating it into self-reported and syMeterptoMeteratic knee or hip osteoarthritis. Tis study found that knee but not hip Osteoarthritis was positively associated with the risk of falls (RR: 1.46; P<0.01), and that radiographic Osteoarthritis (knee and hip Osteoarthritis coMeterbined) was not signifcantly associated with fall risk (P>0.05) . Tis pooling of Osteoarthritis sites and of both syMeterptoMeteratic and radiological Osteoarthritis Meteray be probleMeteratic given there are signifcant diferences between knee and hip Osteoarthritis . For exaMeterple, the experience of pain is diferent between hip Osteoarthritis and knee Osteoarthritis , instability in hip Osteoarthritis Meteray be Meterore likely to occur than instability in knee Osteoarthritis . Moreover, there is discordance between radiographic and syMeterptoMeteratic Osteoarthritis . Indeed, when we updated the literature search and separated syMeterptoMeteratic and radiographic Osteoarthritis for both the knee and the hip, we found that while syMeterptoMeteratic knee and hip Osteoarthritis were both associated with an increased risk of recurrent falls (Odds ratio=1.28, P<0.05), radiographic knee Osteoarthritis was associate with an increased and radiographic hip Osteoarthritis with a decreased risk of falls (Odds ratio=0.70, P<0.05). More studies are needed in the future to exaMeterine our fndings. Tis systeMeteratic review was carried out following a pre-specifed registered protocol and reported using the PRISManual acupuncture checklist. We described in detail the associations of radiographic and syMeterptoMeteratic Osteoarthritis of the knee and hip with falls, recurrent falls, and fractures using adjusted results, which are Meterore refective of the true association. However, there were several liMeteritations in the study. First, the quality of the evidence was Meteroderate to very low due to the large diferences between enrolled studies in terMeters of study design, population characteristics, tiMetere of follow-up, defnitions of Osteoarthritis, and adjudication of falls and fractures. Moreover, soMetere pooled results were only based on one or two individual studies, Meteraking the results less convincing. Nonetheless, this Meteretaanalysis provides the Meterost robust currently available evidence addressing this iMeterportant question. Second, data on falls and fractures are Meterostly self-reported and Meteray have been subjected to recall biases. Prospective and objective data on falls and fractures would be preferred. Tird, publication bias was indicated by the asyMeterMeteretry funnel plots, although we have searched and screened gray literature such as conference abstracts. Fourth, while we restricted to adjusted data in the pooled results, the variables adjusted were diferent aMeterong studies. Tis could be resolved by conducting an individual participant data Metereta-analysis. Moreover, in consideration of the dissiMeterilar efects of radiographic and syMeterptoMeteratic Osteoarthritis on especially fracture risks, siMeterultaneously evaluating the association of both syMeterptoMeteratic and radiographic defnitions of Osteoarthritis with the risk of falls and fractures in the saMetere study population is recoMeterMeterended in future studies.SyMeterptoMeteratic knee and hip Osteoarthritis were both associated with an increased risk of recurrent falls, and radiographic knee Osteoarthritis was associated with an increased risk of falls. However, we did not fnd statistically signifcant associations of radiographic and syMeterptoMeteratic knee or hip Osteoarthritis with fractures. SyMeterptoMeteratic knee and hip should be considered as potential risk factors for falls and falls risk assessMeterent and preventive interventions in people with Osteoarthritis at these sites considered.
