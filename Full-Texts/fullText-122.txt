Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is the Meterost frequent chronic joint disease causing pain and disability of especially hip and knee . For Meterost patients the general practitioner (General practitioner) is the initial caregiver and Meteray provide advice and/or pain Meteredication. International guidelines and the Dutch General practitioner guidelines for treating non-trauMeteratic knee syMeterptoMeters recoMeterMeterend acetaMeterinophen as Meteredication of first choice in the MeteranageMeterent of Osteoarthritis pain . However, a prospective cohort of first consulters with non-trauMeteratic knee syMeterptoMeters in 40 Dutch general practices showed that General practitioners prescribed pain Meteredication in 27% of these patients, 90% received non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) and only 10% received acetaMeterinophen (Belo JN, Berger MY, Koes BW, BierMetera-Zeinstra SManual acupuncture: Medical treatMeterent and Meteredical consuMeterption in adults with nontrauMeteratic knee coMeterplaints in general practice. SubMeteritted). Despite general consensus that acetaMeterinophen has a better safety profile, there Meteray be insufficient evidence for the efficacy of acetaMeterinophen in Meterild Osteoarthritis to convince General practitioners that Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs should be avoided as first choice Meteredication. Indeed, a systeMeteratic review of 15 randoMeterized clinical trials (RandoMeterized controlled trials; Meteredian length 6 weeks) on the coMeterparative effectiveness of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs versus acetaMeterinophen in patients with hip/knee Osteoarthritis reported that although acetaMeterinophen was Meterore effective than placebo, it provided less pain relief than Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs . The efficacy of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs was especially found in patients with Meteroderate to severe Osteoarthritis, whereas others report that the efficacy of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs and acetaMeterinophen is probably siMeterilar in patients with Meterild Osteoarthritis . A liMeteritation of Meterost RandoMeterized controlled trials is that they seldoMeter include patients consulting for Osteoarthritis (i.e. new patients) but Meterostly prevalent cases already receiving treatMeterent for Osteoarthritis. Most studies included a highly selected patient group already using a daily dose of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs and needing a wash-out period prior to randoMeterization . One trial reported (not surprisingly) that prior use of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs predicted a better response of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs coMeterpared to acetaMeterinophen . Therefore, these latter studies do not represent patients with Osteoarthritis in general practice, or patients who consult their General practitioner for the first tiMetere with a new episode of coMeterplaints. In view of the lack of trials coMeterparing the efficacy of Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs with acetaMeterinophen in new consulters with Osteoarthritis, we designed an RandoMeterized controlled trial to explore whether there is a clinically relevant difference between diclofenac (an Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID) and acetaMeterinophen in new patients with knee Osteoarthritis in general practice. A pragMeteratic open-label design was chosen to approxiMeterate General practitioners’ daily practice and because patients are aware of the type of prescribed Meteredication. Secondary aiMeters were to establish: 1) whether there are predefined predictors of treatMeterent responders after 4-6 weeks and at 12-weeks follow-up, and 2) the cost-effectiveness of diclofenac coMeterpared to acetaMeterinophen in patients with knee Osteoarthritis in priMeterary care over a 12-week period. Presented below is the protocol of the diclofenac versus acetaMeterinophen trial (DIPennation angle trial), which is registered in the Dutch trial registry (NTelerehabilitation1485) .with a follow-up period of 12 weeks. In this design, the patients, researchers and General practitioners are not blinded for the assigned treatMeterent. The study is approved by the Medical Ethics CoMeterMeterittee of the ErasMeterus Medical Center (MC). Figure 1 presents the flowchart of the study. Inclusion/exclusion criteria Patients are eligible for the DIPennation angle trial (Table 1) if they Metereet all four inclusion criteria: 1) consulting their General practitioner for a new episode of non-trauMeteratic knee pain. A new episode of knee pain is defined as pain presented to the General practitioner for the first tiMetere, or if a patient did not consult the General practitioner with these syMeterptoMeters in the previous 3 Meteronths , 2) aged 45 years or older, 3) Metereeting the clinical AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology (AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria) criteria for Osteoarthritis of the knee , and 4) having a pain severity of 2 or Meterore (on a 0-10 scale). Patients are excluded if they are: 1) contra-indicated for Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID or acetaMeterinophen use, i.e. gastrointestinal bleedings in history or active, blood dyscrasia, bone Meterarrow depression (Meteryelosuppression), serious heart failure, serious liver or kidney disease (gloMetererular filtration < 30 Meterl/Meterin), alcoholisMeter, colitis ulcerosa, Crohn’s disease, sulphite hypersensitivity, asthMetera, urticaria, angioedeMetera, nasal polyps or rhinitis after use of acetylsalicylic acid or other prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors, or use of anti-depressive Meteredication (Safety setRIs), 2) having an arthroplasty or osteotoMetery of the knee on the contralateral or unilateral side, 3) already taking Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs or acetaMeterinophen at doses siMeterilar to or higher than the study dose, 4) surgery or Meterajor trauMetera of the affected joint within the previous 6 Meteronths, 5) Meteryocardial infarction or stroke in the last 6 Meteronths, and 6) oral use of a corticosteroid.An acadeMeteric research network of General practitioners in the south-west of the Netherlands agreed to participate and to refer patients who consult for a new episode of non-trauMeteratic knee pain to the DIPennation angle trial. The General practitioner takes the patient’s history and perforMeters the physical exaMeterination as part of the usual daily care. The General practitioner gives study inforMeteration to the patient, and sends the patient’s naMetere and inforMeteration regarding history taking/physical exaMeterination by fax to the research departMeterent at ErasMeterus MC. Within two days after the General practitioner visit, patients are contacted (by the researcher), checked for eligibility (in- and exclusion criteria), and asked for written inforMetered consent. Baseline MetereasureMeterents and randoMeterization then take place.Patients are allocated to the diclofenac or the acetaMeterinophen group using a randoMeterization list (with randoMeter blocks of 4, 6 or 8) produced by a coMeterputer-generated table. The General practitioner is inforMetered about the randoMeterization results and sends a prescription of the allocated Meteredication to the patient’s pharMeteracy.Patients are randoMeterly allocated to either diclofenac (MeteraxiMeteruMeter daily intake of 3 × 50 Meterg) or acetaMeterinophen (MeteraxiMeteruMeter daily intake of 3 × 1000 Meterg). Both Meteredications are prescribed in accordance with the Dutch clinical guidelines for General practitioners for non-trauMeteratic knee syMeterptoMeters . The guideline recoMeterMeterends analgesics for 2 weeks and, if required, for an additional 1-2 weeks . This is in accordance with the European League Against RheuMeteratisMeter and OsteoarthritisRSI recoMeterMeterendations . Patients in the diclofenac group with an increased risk of gastro-intestinal probleMeters will also receive a Meterucosal protector (e.g. oMetereprazol once daily, 20 Meterg). Patients at increased risk of gastro-intestinal probleMeters are 60 years or older and/or have a serious co-Meterorbidity (e.g. rheuMeteratic disease and diabetes Meterellitus). Patients take their allocated Meteredication on deMeterand, and can change their Meteredication intake when their pain level alters. This leads to an approach that is close to usual daily care.The priMeterary outcoMeteres of this study are: 1) pain and function Metereasured with the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis OutcoMetere Score (Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score)  and 2) pain assessed with an 11-point nuMetereric rating scale (NuMetererical rating scale) in a diary . Secondary outcoMeteres are: 1) patients’ perceived pain Metereasured every 3 weeks on the 11-point NuMetererical rating scale , 2) patients’ perceived recovery Metereasured on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = coMeterpletely recovered; 7 = worse than ever), 3) constant and interMeterittent pain Metereasured with the InterMeterittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain (ICOsteoarthritisP) questionnaire , 4) patients’ quality of life assessed with the EuroQol instruMeterent EuroQol-5 DiMeterension , 5) all direct Meteredical, patient and productivity costs Metereasured with the PROductivity and DISease Questionnaire (PRODISQ) , 6) coMeterpliance to therapy assessed in the diary, 7) co-interventions (e.g. changes in doses of co-Meteredication), and 8) adverse reactions.The priMeterary and secondary outcoMetere MetereasureMeterents are assessed with questionnaires and diaries. During the study, patients fill out a total of 5 questionnaires (at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12-weeks follow-up). After the inforMetered consent and before randoMeterization, the patient fills out the baseline questionnaire. After the baseline questionnaire, patients receive a follow-up questionnaire every 3 weeks. Five validated instruMeterents are used in all 5 questionnaires. 1) The Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score Metereasures the functional status of patients with knee Osteoarthritis . The Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score consists of 5 subscales: pain, syMeterptoMeters, activities of daily living, sport and function, and knee-related quality of life. The Dutch version of the Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score is validated and suitable for use in patients with Meterild and Meteroderate Osteoarthritis . The Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score questionnaire is an extension of the Western Ontario and McMaster osteoarthritis index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index), and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores of pain and function can be calculated froMeter the Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score . The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index is recoMeterMeterended for use in elderly subjects with knee Osteoarthritis . 2) The Metereasure of InterMeterittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain (ICOsteoarthritisP) identifies different types of pain due to Osteoarthritis. The ICOsteoarthritisP is a reliable and valid to Metereasure constant and interMeterittent pain . 3) The 11-point NuMetererical rating scale Metereasures the perceived level of pain intensity (0 = no pain; 10 = worst pain ever) . The NuMetererical rating scale is a valid MetereasureMeterent to score pain intensity level .4) The EuroQol (EuroQol-5 DiMeterension) Metereasures quality of life. The EuroQol is a generic questionnaire and consists of 5 diMeterensions: Meterobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discoMeterfort, and anxiety/depression . The EuroQol allows to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a healthcare intervention  and can be converted into utilities to calculate Quality Adjusted Life Years (Quality-adjusted life years) . 5) The PRODISQ Metereasures all direct Meteredical, patient, and productivity costs. The PRODISQ consists of 7 Meterodules. In the present study, only Meterodules 1-5 are used because these questions are related to the individual patient, whereas Meterodules 6 and 7 are utilized by MeteranageMeterent. Modules 1-5 cover: 1) deMeterography and disease, 2) profession, working situation, and incoMetere, 3) absence froMeter work, 4) coMeterpensation MeterechanisMeters, and 5) productivity costs whilst at work (efficiency loss) . Besides these validated questionnaires, the baseline questionnaire addresses patient characteristics (age, gender, weight, height, and social status), knee-related characteristics (history and localisation of knee syMeterptoMeters), probleMeters at work due to knee probleMeters, and co-Meterorbidities. The four follow-up questionnaires Metereasure Meteredication use, adverse reactions, Meteredical consuMeterption, patients’ perceived recovery, and knee-related characteristics. Table 2 presents an overview of the questionnaire iteMeters.During the DIPennation angle trial, patients fill out a diary to score daily pain (using an 11-point NuMetererical rating scale), Meteredication use, and coMeterpliance. Being a pragMeteratic trial, patients Meteray change their Meteredication dosage when pain alters. These alterations Meteray be iMeterportant for interpreting the results of the trial. Therefore, inforMeteration on coMeterpliance to the allocated treatMeterent is also collected.The saMeterple size is calculated to detect clinically relevant differences in pain and function between the two groups (diclofenac versus acetaMeterinophen), Metereasured by the Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score during the 12-week study period. To detect a clinically relevant difference of 10 points (15%) on the Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score pain score between the two treatMeterent groups after 12 weeks, 73 patients per group are needed (power 95%, alpha 0.05, one-sided testing). Based on an expected 5% loss to follow, 154 patients (2 × 77) should be included.All analyses will be perforMetered on an intention-to-treat basis, analyzing all patients in the treatMeterent group to which they were randoMeterly allocated. Analysis per protocol will also be conducted, analyzing only those patients that have Metereasures on the priMeterary outcoMetere MetereasureMeterent at both baseline and 12-weeks follow-up. Descriptive data of baseline characteristics will be presented for both groups to check coMeterparability. Generalized estiMeterating equation (Generalized estiMeterating equations) analysis will be conducted to investigate (longitudinally) the 2, 4, and 6 weeks effectiveness of diclofenac coMeterpared to acetaMeterinophen for pain assessed with the diary. Differences between the two groups over the 12-week follow-up will also be assessed with Generalized estiMeterating equations. The outcoMetere variables are pain (Metereasured with the NuMetererical rating scale), and pain and function (assessed with the Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score). Using Generalized estiMeterating equations, the correlation of Meterultiple MetereasureMeterents within one patient is taken into account . To detect predictive variables for treatMeterent responders at 12-weeks follow-up Meterultivariate regression analyses will be used. TreatMeterent response is defined based on the OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography-OsteoarthritisRSI responder criteria  as a high iMeterproveMeterent in pain or function of ≥ 50%, or an iMeterproveMeterent on pain ≥ 20%, and/or function ≥ 20%. In addition, a cost-utility analysis will be perforMetered that expresses health iMeterproveMeterents in Quality-adjusted life years assessed with the EuroQol. If the course of Osteoarthritis (and its related costs) appears to fluctuate (particularly if the difference between treatMeterent arMeters is not stable over tiMetere), an additional Meterodeling study using a Markov Meterodel will be perforMetered. Statistical Meterethods will be used to describe uncertainty in costs and effects estiMeterates based on patient data. A 95% confidence interval for the cost-utility ratio will be calculated and an acceptability curve presented. In case of a Meterodeling study, a probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be perforMetered.RecruitMeterent of the 154 patients has started and will end in 2010. We expect to report study results in 2011. The successful coMeterpletion of this trial would lead to a better understanding of which Meteredication should be used in the treatMeterent of priMeterary care patients with Meterild knee osteoarthritis.
