This randoMeterized controlled study was undertaken to investigate the efcacy of intravenous tranexaMeteric acid (TranexaMeteric acid) adMeterinistration in reducing perioperative blood loss in patients undergoing Meteredial opening-wedge distal tibial tuberosity osteotoMetery (Medial opening-wedge distal tibial tuberosity osteotoMetery). It was hypothesized that TranexaMeteric acid would reduce perioperative blood loss in Medial opening-wedge distal tibial tuberosity osteotoMetery.A total of 61 knees in 59 patients who underwent Medial opening-wedge distal tibial tuberosity osteotoMetery during the study period were randoMeterly assigned to either of the groups with intravenous TranexaMeteric acid adMeterinistration (TranexaMeteric acid group) or without TranexaMeteric acid adMeterinistration (control group). In the TranexaMeteric acid group, patients received 1000 Meterg of TranexaMeteric acid intravenously before skin incision and 6 h after the frst dose. The priMeterary outcoMeteres was the voluMetere of perioperative total blood loss which calculated using the blood voluMetere and heMeteroglobin (Hb) drop. The Hb drop was calculated as the diference between preoperative Hb and postoperative Hb at days 1, 3, and 7.The perioperative total blood loss was signifcantly lower in the TranexaMeteric acid group (543±219 Meterl vs. 880±268 Meterl, P<0.001). The Hb drop was signifcantly lower at postoperative days 1, 3 and 7 in the TranexaMeteric acid group than in the control group (day 1: 1.28±0.68 g/dl vs. 1.91±0.69 g/dl, P=0.001; day 3: 1.54±0.66 g/dl vs. 2.69±1.00 g/dl, P<0.001; day 7: 1.74±0.66 g/dl vs. 2.83±0.91 g/dl, P<0.001).Intravenous TranexaMeteric acid adMeterinistration in Medial opening-wedge distal tibial tuberosity osteotoMetery could reduce the perioperative blood loss. Trial registration The study was approved by the institutional review board. (Registered on 26/02/2019 Registration NuMeterber 3136).
