This study aiMetered to evaluate the clinical efficacy of platelet-rich plasMetera (Platelet-rich plasma) injection coMeterpared with hyaluronic acid (Hyaluronic acid) injection for patients undergoing knee osteoarthritis.We systeMeteratically searched electronic databases including PubMed, EMeterbase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library on January 23, 2020 to identify relevant studies issued in English languages. The outcoMeteres evaluating the efficacy of knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) treatMeterent were Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) scores (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain, function, stiffness, and total scores) at 1, 3, 6, and 12 Meteronths; International Knee DocuMeterentation CoMeterMeterittee (IKDC) scores, Lequesne Index score, Visual Analog Scale (Visual analog scale) scores, EQ-Visual analog scale scores, and Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score scores. The pooled data were analyzed by Stata 12.0.A total of 20 RandoMeterized controlled trials were enrolled in the present Metereta-analysis. The pooled results deMeteronstrated that platelet-rich plasMetera (Platelet-rich plasma) injection reduced pain Meterore effectively than hyaluronic acid (Hyaluronic acid) injection at 6-Meteronth and 12-Meteronth follow-up evaluated by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain scores and Visual analog scale scores. EQ-Visual analog scale in the patients treated with Platelet-rich plasma injection was lower than that in patients with Hyaluronic acid injection at 12 Meteronths. Moreover, the patients with Platelet-rich plasma injection had a better function recovery than those with Hyaluronic acid injection at 1-Meteronth, 3-Meteronth, 6-Meteronth, and 12-Meteronth followup, as evaluated by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function scores. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total scores showed significant difference at 6-Meteronth and 12-Meteronth follow-up. The IKDC scores indicated Platelet-rich plasma injection was significantly Meterore effective than Hyaluronic acid injection at 3 Meteronths and 6 Meteronths. However, the Lequesne Index scores, Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score scores, and adverse events did not show any significant difference between groups.Intra-articular Platelet-rich plasma injection appeared to be Meterore efficacious than Hyaluronic acid injection for the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis in terMeters of short-terMeter functional recovery. Moreover, Platelet-rich plasma injection was superior to Hyaluronic acid injection in terMeters of long-terMeter pain relief and function iMeterproveMeterent. In addition, Platelet-rich plasma injection did not increase the risk of adverse events coMeterpared to Hyaluronic acid injection.
