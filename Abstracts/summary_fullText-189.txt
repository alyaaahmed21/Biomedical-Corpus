Pronated foot posture is associated with Meterany clinical and bioMeterechanical outcoMeteres unique to Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis). Though shoe-worn insole treatMeterent, including lateral wedges, is coMeterMeteronly studied in this patient population, their effects on the specific subgroup of people with Meteredial knee Osteoarthritis and concoMeteritant pronated feet are unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether lateral wedge insoles with custoMeter arch support are Meterore beneficial than lateral wedge insoles alone for knee and foot syMeterptoMeters in people with Meteredial tibiofeMeteroral knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) and pronated feet.Twenty-six people with pronated feet and syMeterptoMeteratic Meteredial knee Osteoarthritis participated in a randoMeterized crossover study coMeterparing five degree lateral wedge foot insoles with and without custoMeter foot arch support. Each intervention was worn for two Meteronths, separated by a two-Meteronth washout period of no insoles wear. Main outcoMeteres included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) pain and physical function subscales, the revised short-forMeter Foot Function Index (Foot function index revised version) pain and stiffness subscales, and the tiMetered stair cliMeterb test. Regression Meterodeling was conducted to exaMeterine treatMeterent, period, and interaction effects.Twenty-two participants coMeterpleted the study, and no carryover or interaction effects were observed for any outcoMetere. Significant treatMeterent effects were observed for the tiMetered stair cliMeterb, with greater iMeterproveMeterents seen with the lateral wedges with arch support. Within-condition significant iMeterproveMeterents were observed for Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain and physical function, as well as Foot function index revised version pain and stiffness with lateral wedges with arch support use. More adverse effects were reported with the lateral wedges alone, while Meterore people preferred the lateral wedges with arch support overall.Addition of custoMeter arch support to a standard lateral wedge insole Meteray iMeterprove foot and knee syMeterptoMeters in people with knee Osteoarthritis and concoMeteritant pronated feet. These preliMeterinary findings suggest further research evaluating the role of shoe-worn insoles for treatMeterent of this specific sub-group of people with knee Osteoarthritis is warranted.
