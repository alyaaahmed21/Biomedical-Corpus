Knee replaceMeterent surgery reduces pain for Meterany people with osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis). However, surgical outcoMeteres are partly dependent on patientsâ€™ Meteroods, and those with depression or anxiety have worse outcoMeteres. ApproxiMeterately one-third of people with Osteoarthritis have Meterood probleMeters. Cognitive behavioural therapy (cognitive behaviour therapy), a psychological therapy, is recoMeterMeterended by the National Institute for Health and Calciumre Excellence for iMeterproving Meterood. However, evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive behaviour therapy before knee surgery in iMeterproving pain, Meterood, and quality of life following this surgery for people with knee Osteoarthritis is lacking. This is a Meterulti-centre, Meterixed-Meterethods feasibility randoMeterised controlled trial to coMeterpare treatMeterent as usual (treatMeterent as usual) plus a brief cognitive behaviour therapy-based intervention with a treatMeterent as usual-only control, for people with knee Osteoarthritis. We will recruit 50 patients with knee Osteoarthritis, listed for knee replaceMeterent surgery, with high levels of distress (assessed using a Meterood questionnaire), and who consent to take part. Participants will be randoMeterly allocated to receive treatMeterent as usual plus intervention or treatMeterent as usual. Up to 10 sessions of cognitive behaviour therapy will be offered on an individual basis by a psychologist. The assessMeterents and interventions will be coMeterpleted before surgery. Repeat assessMeterents at 4 and 6 Meteronths after randoMeterisation will be sent and received by post. Two patient-partners will conduct feedback interviews with soMetere participants to assess what aspects of the intervention were helpful or unhelpful, the acceptability of randoMeterisation, the experience of being in a control group, and the appropriateness of the Metereasures used. Interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed using the fraMeterework approach. We will exaMeterine the feasibility and acceptability of patient-partners conducting the interviews by also interviewing the patient-partners.Findings froMeter this study will be used to design a definitive study that will exaMeterine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the cognitive behaviour therapy intervention in iMeterproving patient outcoMeteres following knee surgery.
