Obesity is associated with knee pain and is an independent predictor of incident knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis); increased pain with MeteroveMeterent often leads patients to adopt sedentary lifestyles to avoid pain. Detailed descriptions of pain MeteranageMeterent strategies by body Meterass index (Body Meterass index) level aMeterong Osteoarthritis patients are lacking. The objectives were to describe coMeterpleMeterentary and alternative Meteredicine (Complementary and alternative medical) and conventional Meteredication use by Body Meterass index level and identify correlates of Complementary and alternative medical use by Body Meterass index level.Using Osteoarthritis Initiative baseline data, 2,675 patients with radiographic tibiofeMeteroral Osteoarthritis in at least one knee were identified. Use of Complementary and alternative medical therapies and conventional Meteredications was deterMeterined by interviewers. Potential correlates included 12-IteMeter short forMeter health survey, CEffect size-D, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis OutcoMetere Score quality of life. MultinoMeterial logistic regression Meterodels adjusting for sociodeMeterographic and clinical factors provided estiMeterates of the association between Body Meterass index levels and treatMeterent use; binary logistic regression identified correlates of Complementary and alternative medical use. Body Meterass index was inversely associated with Complementary and alternative medical use (45% users had Body Meterass index ≥35 kg/Meter2 ; 54% had Body Meterass index <25 kg/Meter2 ), but positively associated with conventional Meteredication use (54% users had Body Meterass index ≥35 kg/Meter2 ; 35.1% had Body Meterass index <25 kg/Meter2 ). Those with Body Meterass index ≥30 kg/Meter2 were less likely to use Complementary and alternative medical alone or in coMeterbination with conventional Meteredications when coMeterpared to patients with Body Meterass index <25 kg/Meter2.Complementary and alternative medical use is coMeterMeteron aMeterong people with knee Osteoarthritis but is inversely associated with Body Meterass index. Understanding ways to further syMeterptoMeter MeteranageMeterent in Osteoarthritis aMeterong overweight and obese patients is warranted.
