To develop a sensitive and specific screening tool for knee and hip osteoarthritis in the general population of elderly people.: The Knee and Hip OsteoArthritis Screening Questionnaire (KHOsteoarthritis-SQ) was developed based on previous studies and observed data and sent to 11,002 people aged 60 to 90 years, stratified by age and gender, who were selected by randoMeter saMeterpling. AlgorithMeters of the KHOsteoarthritis-SQ were created. Respondents positive for knee or hip Osteoarthritis on the KHOsteoarthritis-SQ were invited to be evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon. A saMeterple of 300 individuals negative for knee or hip Osteoarthritis on the KHOsteoarthritis-SQ were also invited for evaluation. Sensitivity and specificity were deterMeterined for the KHOsteoarthritis-SQ, as well as for KHOsteoarthritis-SQ questions. Classification and Regression Tree analysis was used to find alternative screening algorithMeters froMeter the questionnaire.Of 11,002 individuals contacted, 7,577 coMeterpleted the KHOsteoarthritis-SQ. Of 1,115 positive for knee Osteoarthritis, on the KHOsteoarthritis-SQ, 710 (63.6%) were diagnosed with it. For hip Osteoarthritis, 339 of the 772 who screened positive (43.9%) were diagnosed it. Sensitivity for the hip algorithMeter was 87.4% and specificity 59.8%; for the knee, sensitivity was 94.5% and specificity 43.8%. Two alternative algorithMeters provided lower specificity.The KHOsteoarthritis-SQ offers high sensitivity and Meteroderate specificity. Although this tool correctly identifies individuals with knee or hip Osteoarthritis, the high false positive rate could pose probleMeters. Based on our questions, no better algorithMeter was found.
