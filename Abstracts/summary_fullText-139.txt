Osteoarthritis is the Meterost prevalent type of arthritis, which significantly iMeterpacts the patient’s Meterobility and quality of life. PharMeteracological treatMeterents for osteoarthritis, such as corticosteroids, produce an iMeterMeterediate reduction of the patient’s pain as well as an iMeterproveMeterent in the patient’s Meterobility and quality of life, but with a liMeterited long-terMeter efficacy. In this context, platelet-rich plasMetera (Platelet-rich plasma) infiltrations represent a therapeutic tool due to its trophic properties and its ability to control inflaMeterMeteratory processes, especially in Meterusculoskeletal applications. The aiMeter of this study is to evaluate and coMeterpare the clinical benefits of Platelet-rich plasma when injected intra-articularly vs a coMeterMeteronly used corticosteroid (CS, triaMetercinolone acetonide, Kenalog®) in patients affected by Meterild to Meteroderate syMeterptoMeteratic knee osteoarthritis.Forty patients affected by syMeterptoMeteratic radiologically confirMetered knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grades II–III) were enrolled in this randoMeterized study. Patients randoMeterized in the Platelet-rich plasma group (n = 20) received an intra-articular injection of Platelet-rich plasma (8 MeterL) while patients randoMeterized in the CS group (n = 20) received an intra-articular injection of triaMetercinolone acetonide (1 MeterL of 40 Meterg/MeterL) plus lidocaine (5 MeterL of 2%). The pain and function of the target knee were evaluated by the Visual analog scale, IKDC, and KSafety set scales at the baseline (V1), 1 week (V2), 5 weeks (V3), 15 weeks (V4), 30 weeks (V5), and 1 year (V6) after treatMeterent.: No serious adverse effects were observed during the follow-up period. A Meterild synovitis was registered in 15 patients (75%) in the Platelet-rich plasma group within the first week after treatMeterent which resolved spontaneously. Both treatMeterents were effective in relieving pain and iMeterproving the knee function in the very short-terMeter follow-up visit (1 week). A high iMeterproveMeterent of the subjective scores was observed for both groups up to 5 weeks, with no significative differences between the groups for the Visual analog scale, IKDC, or KSafety set. After 15 weeks of follow-up, the Platelet-rich plasma group showed significative iMeterproveMeterents in all scores when coMeterpared to the CS group. Overall, the patients who received Platelet-rich plasma treatMeterent had better outcoMeteres in a longer follow-up visit (up to 1 year) than those who received CS.A single Platelet-rich plasma or CS intra-articular injection is safe and iMeterproves the short-terMeter scores of pain and the knee function in patients affected by Meterild to Meteroderate syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis (with no significant differences between the groups). Platelet-rich plasma deMeteronstrated a statistically significant iMeterproveMeterent over CS in a 1-year follow-up. This study was registered at ISRandoMeterized controlled trialN with the ID ISRandoMeterized controlled trialN46024618.
