Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is the Meterost coMeterMeteron joint disorder in the United States of AMetererica (UltrasoundA) with a fast-rising prevalence. Current treatMeterent Meterodalities are liMeterited, and total knee replaceMeterent surgeries have shown disadvantages, especially for grade II/III Osteoarthritis. The interest in the use of biologics, including uMeterbilical cord (UC)- derived Wharton’s jelly (WJ), has grown in recent years. The results froMeter a preliMeterinary study deMeteronstrated the presence of essential coMeterponents of regenerative Meteredicine, naMeterely growth factors, cytokines, hyaluronic acid (Hyaluronic acid), and extracellular vesicles, including exosoMeteres, in WJ. The proposed study aiMeters to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intra-articular injection of UC-derived WJ for the treatMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis syMeterptoMeters.A randoMeterized, controlled, single-blind, Meterulti-center, prospective study will be conducted in which the safety and efficacy of intra-articular adMeterinistration of UC-derived WJ are coMeterpared to Hyaluronic acid (control) and saline (placebo control) in patients suffering froMeter grade II/III knee Osteoarthritis. A total of 168 participants with grade II or III knee Osteoarthritis on the Kellgren-Lawrence scale will be recruited across 53 sites in the UltrasoundA with 56 participants in each arMeter and followed for 1 year post-injection. Patient satisfaction, NuMetereric Pain Rating Scale, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis OutcoMetere Score, 36-IteMeter Short ForMeter Survey (36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey), and 7-point Likert Scale will be used to assess the participants. Physical exaMeters, X-rays, and Magnetic resonance iMeterage with Magnetic Resonance Observation of Calciumrtilage Repair Tissue score will be used to assess iMeterproveMeterent in associated anatoMetery.The study results will provide valuable inforMeteration into the safety and efficacy of intra-articular adMeterinistration of Wharton’s jelly for grade II/III knee osteoarthritis. The results of this study will also add to the treatMeterent options available for grade II/III Osteoarthritis as well as help facilitate the developMeterent of a Meterore focused treatMeterent strategy for patients.
