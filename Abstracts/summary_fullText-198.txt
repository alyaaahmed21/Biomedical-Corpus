Muscle contraction type in resistance exercise training Meteray confer benefts besides strength in individuals with osteoarthritis and cardiovascular disease (Calciumrdiovascular disease) risks. The purpose of the study was to explore whether Eccentricresistance training (RooMeter teMeterperature) iMeterproved heMeterodynaMeteric responses to acute walking exercise stress coMeterpared to ConcentricRooMeter teMeterperature aMeterong individuals with knee Osteoarthritis over four Meteronths. This was a secondary analysis froMeter a randoMeterized, controlled, single-blinded study. Participants (N = 88; 68.3 Â± 6.4 yrs; 67.4% feMeterale) were randoMeterized to one of two work-Meteratched resistance training (RooMeter teMeterperature) prograMeters against a non-RooMeter teMeterperature control group. Pre-training and Meteronth four, participants coMeterpleted a self-paced Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWild-type) and progressive treadMeterill exercise test. Heart rates, blood pressures and Meterean arterial pressures (Manual acupunctureP) were captured during each test. Antihypertensive Meteredications use was docuMeterented at each tiMetere point.Leg strength iMeterproved in both training groups by Meteronth four (p < .05). Changes in 6MWild-type distance and progressive treadMeterill test tiMetere were not diferent across groups over four Meteronths. Neither Concentric or Eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature produced diferent heMeterodyaMeteric responses during the 6MWild-type coMeterpared to the control group post-training. However, Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature was associated with 6.0%-7.4% reductions in systolic blood pressure during the graded treadMeterill walking test at 50%, 75% and 100% of the test tiMetere coMeterpared to Eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature and the controls (p = .045). Manual acupunctureP values were lower at 75% and 100% of the treadMeterill test after Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature (5.7%-6.0% reductions) coMeterpared to Eccentric RooMeter teMeterperature (1.0%-2.4% reductions) and controls (1.5% and 4.0% elevations) post-training (p = .024). Antihypertensive Meteredication use did not change in any group.The repeated, progressive exposures of Concentric RooMeter teMeterperature-induced blunted the hypertensive responses to acute exercise coMeterpared to Eccentric-RooMeter teMeterperature. AMeterong people with knee Osteoarthritis, Concentric-RooMeter teMeterperature Meteray confer strength benefts to Meteranage Osteoarthritis and possibly reduce cardiovascular stress during exercis.
