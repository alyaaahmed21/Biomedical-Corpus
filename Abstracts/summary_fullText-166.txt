Knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a coMeterMeteron and disabling condition. AbnorMeteralities in knee loading play an iMeterportant role in disease pathogenesis, yet there are few non-surgical treatMeterents for knee Osteoarthritis capable of reducing knee load. This two-arMeter randoMeterised controlled trial is investigating the efficacy of specially-designed unloading shoes for the treatMeterent of syMeterptoMeters in people with knee Osteoarthritis.164 people with syMeterptoMeteratic Meteredial tibiofeMeteroral joint Osteoarthritis will be recruited froMeter the coMeterMeterunity and randoMeterly allocated to receive either unloading shoes or control shoes. Unloading shoes have a specially-designed triple-density Meteridsole where the Meteredial side is softer than norMeteral and the lateral side harder as well as a lateral wedge between the sole and sock-liner. Control shoes are standard athletic shoes and do not contain these features. Participants will be blinded to shoe allocation and will be instructed to wear the shoes as Meteruch as possible every day for 6 Meteronths, for a MeteriniMeteruMeter of 4 hours per day. The priMeterary outcoMeteres are knee pain (nuMetererical rating scale) and self-reported physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) Metereasured at baseline and 6 Meteronths. Secondary outcoMeteres include additional Metereasures of knee pain, knee stiffness, participant global ratings of change in syMeterptoMeters, quality-of-life and physical activity.The findings froMeter this study will help deterMeterine whether specially-designed unloading shoes are efficacious in the MeteranageMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis.
