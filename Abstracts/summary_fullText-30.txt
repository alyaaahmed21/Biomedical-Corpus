The use of Oxford uni-compartmental knee arthroplasty (Uni-compartmental knee arthroplasty;) has rapidly increased worldwide,however,the relevance of younger patients for postoperative function after Oxford Uni-compartmental knee arthroplasty; remains unclear. The main purpose of our study is to clarify the efectivemess of Oxford Uni-compartmental knee arthroplasty; in the younger Chinese patients with anteromedial osteoarthritis (AMOsteoarthritis;).We retrospectively enrolled 252 consecutive patients who underwent Oxford Uni-compartmental knee arthroplasty; for AMOsteoarthritis; with a minimum follow-up of 5 years between March 2013 and December 2016. The patients were divided into the younger (≤60 years) and elderly (>60 years) age groups. The demographic data and surgery variables were recorded and compared. Patient satisfaction grade, range of motion (Range of motion;), Oxford knee score (Oxford knee score;), Hospital for Special Surgery (Hospital for Special Surgery score;) score, Western Ontario and McMaster (Western Ontario McMaster Universities.) Universities Osteoarthritis Index score and postoperative complications were recorded. The 5-year survival of the implants were also compared with Total knee arthroplasty revision as the endpoint. A total of 252 consecutive patients were recruited, including 96 aged 60 years or less and 156 aged over 60 years. The mean follow-up duration in the younger and elderly groups were 73.6months (Standard deviation.,standard deviation, 4.1) and 74.7months (Standard deviation. 6.2) respectively. Patient satisfaction rate was high in both groups (P=0.805). Furthermore, no signifcant diferences were observed in postoperative Range of motion;(P=0.299), Oxford knee score;(P=0.117), Hospital for Special Surgery score;(P=0.357) and Western Ontario McMaster Universities. scores(P=0.151) between the younger and elderly groups (P>0.05). However, the incidence of joint stifness (P=0.033) and delayed wound dehiscence (P=0.026) were signifcantly diferent between both groups. Five-year implant survival without revision were also similar in both groups (96.9% vs 97.4%, P=0.871), and that for the entire cohort was 97.2% (95% Confdence interval. 95.4–99.6). Oxford Uni-compartmental knee arthroplasty; for AMOsteoarthritis; demonstrated favorable results in younger patients aged ≤60 years at a minimum 5-year follow-up in terms of patient satisfaction, functional outcomes, implant survival and postoperative complications. Therefore, younger patients might not be considered as an absolute contraindication to Oxford Uni-compartmental knee arthroplasty;.
