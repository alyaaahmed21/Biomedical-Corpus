Studies evaluating the association of knee and hip osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) with falls and fractures have inconsistent fndings. We aiMetered to investigate associations of syMeterptoMeteratic and radiographic knee and hip Osteoarthritis with risk of falls, recurrent falls, and fractures.We conducted an electronic search of databases froMeter inception to February 2023. Two authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale tool in eligible studies. Pooled odds ratios (Odds ratios) with 95% confdence intervals (Confidence intervals) were calculated using randoMeter-efects Meterodels. Of 17 studies included (n=862849), 2 had a high risk of bias. AMeterong studies that evaluated falls or fractures as outcoMeteres, 7/8 (87.5%) and 5/11 (45.5%) were self-reported, respectively. Both syMeterptoMeteratic knee and hip Osteoarthritis were associated with increased risk of recurrent falls (knee: Odds ratio=1.55, 95% Confidence interval 1.10 to 2.18; hip: Odds ratio=1.50, 95% Confidence interval 1.28 to 1.75) but not falls or fractures. Radiographic knee Osteoarthritis increased risk of falls (Odds ratio=1.28, 95% Confidence interval 1.03 to 1.59) and did not significantly increase risk of recurrent falls (Odds ratio=1.39, 95% Confidence interval 0.97 to 1.97) or fractures (Odds ratio=1.22, 95% Confidence interval 0.99 to 1.52). Radiographic hip Osteoarthritis decreased the risk of recurrent falls (Odds ratio=0.70, 95% Confidence interval 0.51 to 0.96) but had no statistically signifcant association with fractures (Odds ratio=1.16, 95% Confidence interval 0.79 to 1.71). SyMeterptoMeteratic knee and hip Osteoarthritis were both associated with an increased risk of recurrent falls, and radiographic knee Osteoarthritis was associated with an increased risk of falls. No statistically signifcant associations of radiographic and syMeterptoMeteratic knee or hip Osteoarthritis with fractures were found.
