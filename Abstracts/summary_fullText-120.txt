Cutpoints (CPs) for Meterild, Meteroderate and severe pain are established and used priMeterarily in cancer pain. In this study, we wanted to deterMeterine the optiMeteral CPs for Meterild, Meteroderate, and severe pain in joint replaceMeterent surgery candidates with osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) of the hip or knee, and to validate the different CPs.Patients (n = 353) coMeterpleted the Brief Pain Inventory (BPrincipal investigator), the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Arthritis Index, and the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey health status Metereasure. OptiMeteral CPs for categorizing average pain with three severity levels were derived using Meterultivariate analysis of variance, using different CP sets for average pain as the independent variable and seven interference iteMeters froMeter the BPrincipal investigator as the dependent variable. To validate the CPs, we assessed if patients in the three pain severity groups differed in pain as assessed with Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey, and if BPrincipal investigator average pain with the optiMeteral CPs resulted in higher correlation with pain diMeterensions of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey than other CPs.The optiMeteral CPs on the 0â€“10 point BPrincipal investigator scale were CP (4,6) aMeterong hip patients and CP (4,7) aMeterong knee patients. The resulting pain severity groups differed in pain, as assessed with other scales than those used to derive the CPs. The optiMeteral CPs had the highest association of average pain with Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain scores.CPs for pain severity differed soMeterewhat for patients with Osteoarthritis of the hip and knee. The association of BPrincipal investigator average pain scores categorized according to the optiMeteral CPs with Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain scores supports the validity of the derived optiMeteral CPs.
