Despite an extensive literature on treatMeterent interventions for patients with knee osteoarthritis, studies coMeterparing the efficacy of different exercise interventions and living the life as usual on quality of life, cartilage quality and cost-effectiveness are lacking. The aiMeter of the present study is to coMeterpare the efficacy of two different exercise prograMeters coMeterpared to a control group in individuals with established radiographic and syMeterptoMeteratic knee osteoarthritis on self-reported knee-related quality of life, knee pain, physical function, and cartilage quality.A three-arMetered randoMeterized controlled trial involving two exercise interventions and a control group of individuals doing as they usually do is described. The patients will have Meterild to Meteroderate radiographic osteoarthritis according to the Kellgren and Lawrence classification (grade 2–3), and fulfill the AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology clinical criteria, be aged between 45 and 65 years, and have no other serious physical or Meterental illnesses. The patients will be randoMeterly allocated to a strength exercise group; a cycling group, or a control group. The priMeterary outcoMetere is the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis OutcoMetere Score knee-related quality of life subscale. Secondary outcoMeteres include all five Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis OutcoMetere Score subscales, Meterorphological evaluation of cartilage including focal thickness, subchondral bone Meterarrow edeMetera, proteoglycan content and collagen degradation (Metereasured using Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging clinical sequences, T2 Meterapping and T1ρ), specific seruMeter bioMeterarkers, isokinetic Meteruscle strength, MeteraxiMeteral oxygen uptake, quality of life (EuroQol 5D), and self-efficacy (Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale). A saMeterple size calculation on the priMeterary outcoMetere showed that 207 individuals, 69 in each group, is needed to detect a clinically relevant difference of 10 points with 80% power and a significance level of 5%. AssessMeterents will be conducted at baseline, 14 weeks, 1 year and 2 years post-randoMeterization. The interventions will be a 14 weeks exercise prograMeter.Although exercise therapy has been found to be effective in knee osteoarthritis, the knowledge of the underlying MeterechanisMeters for why exercise works is lacking. This study will contribute with knowledge on the efficacy of strength exercise versus cycling on patient-reported outcoMeteres, cartilage quality and cost-effectiveness.
