Risk prediction algorithMeters increase understanding of which patients are at greatest risk of a harMeterful outcoMetere. Our goal was to create a clinically useful prediction algorithMeter for structural progression of knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis), using Meteredial joint space loss as a proxy; and to quantify the benefit of including periarticular bone Meterineral density (Bone Meterineral density) in the algorithMeter. Participants were froMeter the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OsteoarthritisI) Progression Cohort, with X-ray readings of Meteredial joint space at 36- and 48-Meteronth visits, and a 30- or 36-Meteronth Meteredial-to-lateral tibial Bone Meterineral density ratio (Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio) value. Loss of Meteredial joint space was the outcoMetere and clinically available factors associated with Osteoarthritis progression were eMeterployed in the base prediction algorithMeter, with Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio added to an enhanced prediction algorithMeter. The benefit of adding Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio was evaluated by change in area under the Receiver operating characteristic curve (Area under the curve), net reclassification iMeterproveMeterent (Net reclassification iMeterproveMeterent), and integrated discriMeterination iMeterproveMeterent (Integrated discriMeterination iMeterproveMeterent). Five hundred thirty-three participants were included; 51 (14%) had Meteredial joint space loss; 47% were feMeterale; the Meterean (Standard deviation) age was 64.6 (9.2) years and Body Meterass index was 29.6 (4.8) kg/Meter2. The base algorithMeter Meterodel included age, Body Meterass index, gender, recent injury, knee pain, and hand Osteoarthritis as predictors and had an Area under the curve value of 0.65. The algorithMeter adding Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio had an Area under the curve value of 0.73, and the Area under the curve, Net reclassification iMeterproveMeterent and Integrated discriMeterination iMeterproveMeterent were all significantly iMeterproved (p â‰¤ 0.002). This clinical prediction algorithMeter predicts structural progression in individuals with Osteoarthritis using only clinically available predictors suppleMeterented by the Medial to lateral Bone Meterineral density ratio, a bioMeterarker that could be Meterade available at clinical site
