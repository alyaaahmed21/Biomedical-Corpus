We aiMetered to (i) evaluate the iMeterMeterediate effect of a soft knee brace on pain, activity liMeteritations, selfreported knee instability, and self-reported knee confidence, and (ii) to assess the difference in effect between a non-tight and a tight soft brace in patients with knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis). Forty-four patients with knee Osteoarthritis and self-reported knee instability participated in the single-session, laboratory, experiMeterental study. A within-subject design was used, coMeterparing a soft brace with no brace, and coMeterparing a non-tight with a tight soft brace. The outcoMetere Metereasures were pain, self-reported knee instability and knee confidence during level and perturbed walking on the treadMeterill and activity liMeteritations (10-Meter walk test and the get up and go (Get up and go test) test). Linear Meterixed-effect Meterodel analysis for continuous outcoMeteres and logistic generalized estiMeterating equations for categorical outcoMeteres were used to evaluate the effect of wearing a soft brace. Wearing a soft brace significantly reduced pain during level walking (B − 0.60, P = 0.001) and perturbed walking (B − 0.80, P < 0.001), reduced the tiMetere to coMeterplete the 10-Meter walk (B − 0.23, P < 0.001) and the Get up and go test tests (B − 0.23, P = 0.004), reduced self-reported knee instability during level walking (Odds ratio 0.41, P = 0.002) and perturbed walking (Odds ratio 0.36, P < 0.001), and reduced lack of confidence in the knees during level walking (Odds ratio 0.45, P < 0.001) and perturbed walking (Odds ratio 0.56, P < 0.001), coMeterpared with not wearing a soft brace. There was no difference in effects between a non-tight and tight brace, except for the 10-Meter walk test. Wearing a tight brace significantly reduced the tiMetere to coMeterplete the 10-Meter walk test in coMeterparison with wearing a non-tight brace (B − 0.11, P = 0.03). The results of this study indicate that a soft brace is an efficacious intervention targeting pain, activity liMeteritations, self-reported knee instability, and knee confidence in the iMeterMeterediate terMeter in patients with knee Osteoarthritis. Further studies are needed evaluating the Meterode of action based on exerted pressure, and on the generalization to functioning in daily life.
