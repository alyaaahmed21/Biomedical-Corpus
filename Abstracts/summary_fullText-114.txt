CoMeterparison of two doses of bio-optiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extract (BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts) in the MeteranageMeterent of syMeterptoMeteratic knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis). A prospective, randoMeterized, 3-Meteronth, double-blind, Meterulticenter, three-group, placebo-controlled trial assessing Patient Global AssessMeterent of Disease Activity (Patient Global AssessMeterent of Disease Activity) and seruMeter sColl2-1, a bioMeterarker of cartilage degradation, as co-priMeterary endpoints. Pain on visual analog scale (Visual analog scale), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis OutcoMetere Score (Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score), and paracetaMeterol/non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drug (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID) consuMeterption were used as secondary endpoints. One hundred fifty patients with knee Osteoarthritis were followed for 90 days. Low and high doses of BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts showed a greater decrease of Patient Global AssessMeterent of Disease Activity than placebo. Analysis of sColl2-1 showed in the placebo and BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts low-dose groups, but not in the BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts high-dose group, a transient but non-significant increase of sColl2-1 between T0 and T1. Thereafter, in all groups, sColl2-1 decreased between T1 and T3 (all p < 0.01), but no difference between the groups was found. Pain reduction at day 90 in the low- and high-dose BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts groups (− 29.5 MeterMeter and − 36.5 MeterMeter) was higher than that in the placebo (− 8 MeterMeter; p = 0.018). The global Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score significantly decreased overtiMetere, but changes were coMeterparable across treatMeterent arMeters. The ratio of patients with adverse events (Adverse event) related to the product was siMeterilar in the placebo and treatMeterent groups, but the nuMeterber of Adverse event linked to the product was higher in the high-dose BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts group coMeterpared to the placebo (p = 0.012). BiooptiMeterized CurcuMetera longa extracts appeared safe and well-tolerated with no evidence of severe adverse effects. Efficacy analysis suggested positive trends for MetereasureMeterents of Patient Global AssessMeterent of Disease Activity and seruMeter levels of an Osteoarthritis bioMeterarker and showed a rapid and significant decrease of pain in knee Osteoarthritis (Trial registration: NCoMeterputed toMeterography02909621, 21 SepteMeterber 2016 - retrospectively registered).
