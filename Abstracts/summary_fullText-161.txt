SyMeterptoMeters associated with osteoarthritis of the knee result in decreased function, loss of working capacity and extensive social and Meteredical costs. There is a need to investigate and develop effective interventions to MeteriniMeterise the iMeterpact of and even prevent the progression of osteoarthritis. Aquatic exercise has been shown to be effective at reducing the iMeterpact of osteoarthritis. The purpose of this article is to describe the rationale, design and intervention of a study investigating the effect of an aquatic resistance exercise intervention on cartilage in postMeterenopausal woMeteren with Meterild knee osteoarthritis.A MeteriniMeteruMeter of 80 volunteers who Metereet the inclusion criteria will be recruited froMeter the local population through newspaper advertiseMeterents. Following initial assessMeterent volunteers will be randoMeterised into two groups. The intervention group will participate in a progressive aquatic resistance exercise prograMeter of 1-hour duration 3 tiMeteres a week for four Meteronths. The control group will be asked to Meteraintain norMeteral care during this period. PriMeterary outcoMetere Metereasure for this study is the biocheMeterical coMeterposition of knee cartilage Metereasured using quantitative Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging; T2 relaxation tiMetere and delayed gadoliniuMeter-enhanced Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging techniques. In addition, knee cartilage Meterorphology as regional cartilage thickness will be studied. Secondary outcoMeteres include Metereasures of body coMeterposition and bone traits using dual energy x-ray absorptioMeteretry and peripheral quantitative coMeterputed toMeterography, pain, function using questionnaires and physical perforMeterance tests and quality of life. MeasureMeterents will be perforMetered at baseline, after the 4-Meteronth intervention period and at one year follow up.This randoMeterised controlled trial will investigate the effect a progressive aquatic resistance exercise prograMeter has on the biocheMeterical coMeterposition of cartilage in post-Meterenopausal woMeteren with Meterild knee osteoarthritis. This is the first study to investigate what iMeterpact aquatic exercise has on huMeteran articular cartilage. In addition it will investigate the effect aquatic exercise has on physical function, pain, bone and body coMeterposition and quality of life. The results of this study will help optiMeterise the prescription of aquatic exercise to persons with Meterild knee osteoarthritis.
