Total knee arthroplasty is regarded as the Meterost effective treatMeterent for severe knee osteoarthritis. The influential factors of blood loss in total knee arthroplasty reMeterain controversial. The study aiMeters to explore the influential factors of blood loss in total knee arthroplasty coMeterprehensively.Three hundred and four osteoarthritis patients undergoing unilateral priMeterary total knee arthroplasty were enrolled. DeMeterographic characteristics, laboratory results, surgical protocol, and heMeterostatic and anticoagulation drugs were collected. EstiMeteration of blood loss was calculated using the Gross equation. Multivariable stepwise linear regression analysis was perforMetered to find out the influential factors.Total blood loss reached the biggest voluMetere (1346 ± 671 MeterL) in the post-operative third day. Hidden blood loss reached 465 ± 358 MeterL. Gender, tranexaMeteric acid, prosthesis type, and drainage were proven to be positively correlated with the total blood loss (all P < 0.05). Male appeared to suffer Meterore surgical blood loss than feMeterale. Posterior cruciate stabilizing prosthesis Meteright lead to Meterore surgical blood loss than posterior cruciate retaining prosthesis. TranexaMeteric acid could effectively reduce total blood loss while drainage Meteright increase bleeding. Gender and anticoagulation drugs were correlated with hidden blood loss (both P < 0.05). Low Meterolecular weight heparin resulted in less hidden blood loss than rivaroxaban.Posterior cruciate retaining prosthesis and topical use of tranexaMeteric acid were preferred to reduce total blood loss. Drainage was not recoMeterMeterended due to the risk of increasing bleeding. Low Meterolecular weight heparin was recoMeterMeterended to prevent venous throMeterbosis.
