Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis;) considered as one of the most common degenerative diseases of synovial joint. KOsteoarthritis; is mostly managed by physical therapy, focused on pain management, the range of motion and muscle strengthening but muscle flexibility is usually neglected. A study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of dynamic soft tissue mobilization (Dynamic Soft Tissue Mobilization) in comparison with the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation) stretching in the management of hamstring tightness, reduction of pain intensity and improvement of physical functionality in KOsteoarthritis;. Forty eight patients with KOsteoarthritis; were randomly allocated to group A receiving DTSM and group B receiving Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation stretching. The cryotherapy and isometric strengthening exercises were also given to both groups. Total treatment duration consisted of 4 weeks, 3 sessions per week and total 12 sessions per patient. Each treatment session comprised of 30 min. At baseline and post treatment, Active knee extension test(Active Knee Extension,T), Visual analogue scale (Visualanalogue scale;), and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score;) were used to assess hamstring flexibility, pain intensity level and physical functional capability respectively. The continuous variables were shown as mean and standard deviations. For the comparison of outcome within and between groups, paired sample and independent t-test was applied. Considerable p value was less than 0.05. The between group analysis of Visualanalogue scale;, right Active Knee Extension, test, and left Active Knee Extension, test showed non-significant (p>0.05) mean difference as 0.2 (95% Confidence interval;= -0.29, 0.70), 1.79 (95% Confidence interval;= -1.84, 4.59), 1.78 (95% Confidence interval;= -1.6, 5.19) respectively. Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score; domains of symptom, pain, Function in daily livings, sports and recreational, and quality of life had also non-significant (p>0.05) mean difference as 1.12 (95% Confidence interval;= -4.05, 6.3), -5.12 (95% Confidence interval;= -12.71, 2.46), -2.55 (95% Confidence interval;= -7.47, 2.38), -2.7 (95% Confidence interval;= -9.72, 4.3), and âˆ’0.68 (95% Confidence interval;= -7.69, 6.36) respectively. Significant (p<0.001) improvement was shown in both groups for all outcome measures after 12 sessio Dynamic Soft Tissue Mobilization and Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation stretching, both treatments are equally beneficial in KOsteoarthritis; for hamstring flexibility, pain reduction and functional mobility in terms of Active Knee Extension,T, Visualanalogue scale;, and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score; respectively.
