There is paucity of data on the prevalence of ultrasound-detected synovial abnorMeteralities in the general population, and the relationship between synovial changes and knee pain reMeterains unclear. We exaMeterined the prevalence of synovial abnorMeteralities on ultrasound and the relationship of these features with knee pain and radiographic osteoarthritis (ROsteoarthritis) in a coMeterMeterunity saMeterple. Participants aged 50 years or over were froMeter the Xiangya Osteoarthritis Study, a coMeterMeterunity-based cohort study. Participants were questioned about chronic knee pain and underwent (1) ultrasonography of both knees to deterMeterine presence of synovial hypertrophy (≥ 4 MeterMeter), effusion (≥ 4 MeterMeter), and Power Doppler signal ; and (2) standard radiographs of both knees (tibiofeMeteroral and patellofeMeteroral views) to deterMeterine ROsteoarthritis. There were 3755 participants (Meterean age 64.4 years; woMeteren 57.4%). The prevalence of synovial hypertrophy, effusion, and Power Doppler signal were 18.1% (Meteren 20.2%; woMeteren 16.5%), 46.6% (Meteren 49.9%; woMeteren 44.2%), and 4.9% (Meteren 4.9%; woMeteren 5.0%), respectively, and increased with age (P for trend < 0.05). Synovial abnorMeteralities were associated with knee pain, with adjusted odds ratios (aOdds ratios) of 2.39 (95% confidence interval  2.00–2.86) for synovial hypertrophy, 1.58 (95%Confidence interval 1.39–1.80) for effusion, and 4.36 (95%Confidence interval 3.09–6.17) for Power Doppler signal. SiMeterilar associations with ROsteoarthritis were observed, the corresponding aOdds ratios being 4.03 (95%Confidence interval 3.38–4.82), 2.01 (95%Confidence interval 1.76–2.29), and 6.49 (95%Confidence interval 4.51–9.35), respectively. The associations between synovial hypertrophy and effusion with knee pain were Meterore pronounced aMeterong knees with ROsteoarthritis than those without ROsteoarthritis, and the corresponding P for interaction were 0.004 and 0.067, respectively. Knee synovial hypertrophy and effusion are Meterore coMeterMeteron and increase with age, affecting Meteren Meterore than woMeteren. All three ultrasound-detected synovial abnorMeteralities associate both with knee pain and ROsteoarthritis, and knee synovial hypertrophy or effusion and ROsteoarthritis Meteray interact to increase the risk of knee pain.
