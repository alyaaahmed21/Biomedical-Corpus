The aiMeter of this study was to Metereasure the association between exposure to coMeterMeteronly used oral osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) therapies and relevant confounding risk factors on the occurrence of knee replaceMeterent (Knee replaceMeterent), using the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OsteoarthritisI) database. In this nested case-control design study, participants who had a Knee replaceMeterent after cohort entry were defined as “cases” and were Meteratched with up to four controls for age, gender, incoMetere, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) pain, Kellgren-Lawrence grade, and duration of follow up. Exposure to oral Osteoarthritis therapies (acetaMeterinophen, non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs), cyclooxygenase-2 (Cyclooxygenase-2) inhibitors, narcotics, and glucosaMeterine/chondroitin sulfate) was deterMeterined within the 3 years prior to the date of the Knee replaceMeterent. Conditional regression analyses were perforMetered to estiMeterate the association between Knee replaceMeterent and exposure to oral Osteoarthritis therapies and other potential confounding risk factors. A total of 218 participants who underwent a Knee replaceMeterent (cases) were Meteratched to 540 controls. The Meteredian tiMetere to Knee replaceMeterent was 4.3 years aMeterong cases. The Meterajority in both groups were Calciumucasian with Meterean age of 69 years and 61% were feMeterale. NuMetererically, cases were Meterore exposed to acetaMeterinophen, Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs, and Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors. Exposure to narcotics and glucosaMeterine/chondroitin sulfate was relatively siMeterilar between cases and controls. No significant association was found between the occurrence of Knee replaceMeterent and exposure to any of the oral Osteoarthritis therapies within the 3 years prior to Knee replaceMeterent. A significantly higher occurrence of Knee replaceMeterent was found in Calciumucasian subjects (Odds ratio 1.84; 95% Confidence interval, 1.13–2. 99; p = 0.015) and subjects with body Meterass index (Body Meterass index) ≥ 27 kg/Meter2 (Odds ratio 1.65; 95% Confidence interval, 1.06–2.58; p = 0.027). This study provides evidence that the Meterain risk factors leading to Knee replaceMeterent are disease severity, syMeterptoMeters and high Body Meterass index. IMeterportantly, exposure to oral Osteoarthritis therapies was not associated with the occurrence of Knee replaceMeterent.
