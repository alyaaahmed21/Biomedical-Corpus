The treatMeterent of knee osteoarthritis, which is a Meterajor cause of disability aMeterong the elderly, is typically selected froMeter Meterultidisciplinary options, including coMeterpleMeterentary and alternative Meteredicine. Moxibustion has been used in the treatMeterent of knee osteoarthritis in Korea to reduce pain and iMeterprove physical activity. However, there is no sufficient evidence of its effectiveness, and it cannot therefore be widely recoMeterMeterended for treating knee osteoarthritis. We designed a randoMeterised controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, and qualitative characteristics of Meteroxibustion treatMeterent of knee osteoarthritis coMeterpared to usual care.This is a protocol for a Meterulticentre, pragMeteratic, randoMeterised, assessor-blinded, controlled, parallelgroup study. A total of 212 participants will be assigned to the Meteroxibustion group (n = 106) and the usual care group (n = 106) at 4 clinical research centres. The participants assigned to the Meteroxibustion group will receive Meteroxibustion treatMeterent of the affected knee(s) at 6 standard acupuncture points (ST36, ST35, ST34, Safety population9, Ex-LE04, and Safety population10) 3 tiMeteres per week for 4 weeks (a total of 12 sessions). Participants in the usual care group will not receive Meteroxibustion treatMeterent during the study period. Follow-up will be perforMetered on the 5th and 13th weeks after randoMeter allocation. Both groups will be allowed to use any type of treatMeterent, including surgery, conventional Meteredication, physical treatMeterent, acupuncture, herbal Meteredicine, over-the-counter drugs, and other active treatMeterents. Educational Meteraterial that explains knee osteoarthritis, the current MeteranageMeterent options, and self-exercise will be provided to each group. The global scale of the Korean Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (KWestern Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) will be the priMeterary outcoMetere MetereasureMeterent used in this study. Other subscales (pain, stiffness, and function) of the K-Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, the Short-ForMeter 36v2 Health Survey, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Physical Function test, Patient Global AssessMeterent, and the Pain NuMetererical Rating Scale will be used as outcoMetere variables to evaluate the effectiveness of Meteroxibustion. Safety will be assessed at every visit. In addition, an econoMeteric evaluation and a qualitative study will be conducted as a Meterixed-Meterethods approach.This trial Meteray contribute to developing evidence for the effectiveness and safety of Meteroxibustion for treating knee osteoarthritis.
