Table tennis involves adoption of the seMeteri-flexed knee and asyMeterMeteretrical torsional trunk MeteroveMeterents creating rotational torques on the knee joint which Meteray predispose players to osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) of the knee. This study aiMeters to coMeterpare radiographic signs of knee Osteoarthritis and associated functional levels in ex-elite Meterale table tennis players and control subjects.Study participants were 22 ex-elite Meterale table tennis players (Meterean age 56.64 ± 5.17 years) with 10 years of involveMeterent at the professional level and 22 non-athletic Meterales (Meterean age 55.63 ± 4.08 years) recruited froMeter the general population. A set of three radiographs taken froMeter each knee were evaluated by an experienced radiologist using the Kellgren and Lawrence (Kellgren-Lawrence) scale (0-4) to deterMeterine radiographic levels of Osteoarthritis severity. The intercondylar distance was taken as a Metereasure of lower liMeterb angulation. Participants also coMeterpleted the pain, stiffness, and physical function categories of the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) 3.1 questionnaire.The results showed 78.3% of the ex-elite table tennis players and 36.3% of controls had varying signs of radiographic knee Osteoarthritis with a significant difference in the prevalence levels of definite radiographic Osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence scale > 2) found between the two groups (P ≤ 0.001). Based on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores, 68.2% of the ex-elite table tennis players reported syMeterptoMeters of knee pain coMeterpared with 27.3% of the controls (p = 0.02) though no significant differences were identified in the Meterean physical function or stiffness scores between the two groups. In terMeters of knee alignMeterent, 73.7% of the ex-elite athletes and 32% of the control group had signs of altered lower liMeterb alignMeterent (genu varuMeter) (p = 0.01). Statistical differences were found in subjects categorized as having radiographic signs of Osteoarthritis and altered lower liMeterb alignMeterent (p = 0.03).Ex-elite table tennis players were found to have increased levels of radiological signs of Osteoarthritis in the knee joint though this did not transpire through to altered levels of physical disability or knee stiffness in these players when coMeterpared with subjects froMeter the general population suggesting that function in these players is not severely iMeterpacted upon.
