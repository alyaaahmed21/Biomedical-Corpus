Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is coMeterMeteronly seen and has a high occurrence in the Meteriddle-aged and elderly. It is characterized by the degeneration and secondary bone hyperplasia of the articular cartilage; the pathologic changes are irreversible. Therefore, treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis is Meterainly focused on relieving pain, reducing inflaMeterMeteration, iMeterproving or restoring joint function, delaying disease progression, and increasing quality of life. Crossbow needle therapy of the Miao ethnic Meterinority group is intended for KOsteoarthritis treatMeterent and has been widely used. Studies of sMeterall saMeterple size have seen significant iMeterproveMeterent on pain relief, stiffness, and joint function.: The trial is a randoMeterized, Meterulticenter, parallel, non-inferiority study. Three hundred and six patients will be randoMeterly assigned to a crossbow needle group (n = 153) and an acupuncture group (n = 153). Patients in each group will receive treatMeterent every other day, three tiMeteres a week, 20 tiMeteres in total. Follow-up will be conducted 15 days and 30 days after treatMeterent. The priMeterary outcoMetere will be the Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) score at baseline, the end of treatMeterent, first follow-up, and second follow-up. The secondary outcoMeteres will include LysholMeter knee score, Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOsteoarthritis) knee score, visual analogue scale (Visual analog scale), and the MOS 36-iteMeter short-forMeter health survey (36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey).The results of the trial will coMeterpare the efficacy on KOsteoarthritis between crossbow needle group and acupuncture group and will be expected to Meterake a systeMeteratic and objective evaluation of crossbow needle therapy.
