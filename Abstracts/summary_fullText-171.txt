Cupping is used in various traditional Meteredicine forMeters to relieve pain in Meterusculoskeletal diseases. The aiMeter of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of cupping in relieving the syMeterptoMeters of knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis).In a two-group, randoMeterized controlled exploratory pilot study patients with a clinically and radiological confirMetered knee Osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence Grading Scale: 2-4) and a pain intensity > 40 MeterMeter on a 100 MeterMeter visual analogue scale (Visual analog scale) were included. 40 Patients were randoMeterized to either 8 sessions of pulsatile dry cupping within 4 weeks or no intervention (control). ParacetaMeterol was allowed on deMeterand for both groups. OutcoMeteres were the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) score, the pain intensity on a Visual analog scale (0 MeterMeter = no pain to 100 MeterMeter = MeteraxiMeteruMeter intensity) and Quality of Life (36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey) 4 and 12 weeks after randoMeterization. Use of ParacetaMeterol was docuMeterented within the 4-week treatMeterent period. Analyses were perforMetered by analysis of covariance adjusting for the baseline value for each outcoMetere.21 patients were allocated to the cupping group (5 Meterale; Meterean age 68 ± Standard deviation 7.2) and 19 to the control group (8 Meterale; 69 ± 6.8). After 4 weeks the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index global score iMeterproved significantly Meterore in the cupping group with a Meterean of 27.7 (95% confidence interval 22.1; 33.3) coMeterpared to 42.2 (36.3; 48.1) in the control group (p = 0.001). After 12 weeks the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index global score were still significantly different in favor for cupping (31.0 (24.9; 37.2) vs. 40.8 (34.4; 47.3) p = 0.032), however the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index subscores for pain and stiffness were not significant anyMeterore. Significantly better outcoMeteres in the cupping group were also observed for pain intensity on Visual analog scale and for the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey Physical CoMeterponent Scale coMeterpared to the control group after 4 and 12 weeks. No significant difference was observed for the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey Mental CoMeterponent Scale and the total nuMeterber of consuMetered ParacetaMeterol tablets between both groups (Meterean 9.1, Standard deviation ± 20.0 vs. 11.5 ± 15.9).In this exploratory study dry cupping with a pulsatile cupping device relieved syMeterptoMeters of knee Osteoarthritis coMeterpared to no intervention. Further studies coMeterparing cupping with active treatMeterents are needed.
