Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) priMeterarily presents with syMeterptoMeters of pain and coMeterproMeterised functionality. Pain is a subjective Meteranifestation that necessitates the eMeterployMeterent of reliable evaluation tools for practical assessMeterent, thereby enabling the forMeterulation of appropriate interventional strategies. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPrincipal investigator) is a widely utilized questionnaire for evaluating the status of chronic pain. The purpose of the present study is to translate the short forMeter of BPrincipal investigator into Chinese version (BPrincipal investigator-CV) and conduct cross-cultural adaptation to evaluate the psychoMeteretric characteristics of BPrincipal investigator-CV in KOsteoarthritis patients.BPrincipal investigator-CV was translated and cross-culturally adapted according to internationally recognized guidelines. A cohort coMeterprising 150 patients diagnosed with KOsteoarthritis successfully coMeterpleted the deMeterographic questionnaire, BPrincipal investigatorCV, Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index), and the EuroQuality of life score Group’s fve-diMeterension questionnaire (EuroQol-5 DiMeterension). Internal consistency and test–retest analysis were used to evaluate the reliability. The internal consistency of the scale iteMeters was evaluated by calculating the Cronbach’s α value (>0.7). We chose to eMeterploy two scales coMeterMeteronly used in the evaluation of KOsteoarthritis patients: the disease-specifc Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scale and the universal EuroQol-5 DiMeterension scale. Construct validity was deterMeterined through Pearson correlation analysis, coMeterparing BPrincipal investigator scores with those obtained froMeter the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and EuroQol-5 DiMeterension scales. Exploratory factor analysis was used to structural validity.The BPrincipal investigator-CV was well accepted with no ceiling or foor efect. Cronbach’s α for assessing internal consistency was 0.894. Test–retest reliability was excellent with an Intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.852 (95%Confidence interval 0.785–0.905). The BPrincipal investigator-CV showed Meteroderate to strong correlations with the pain diMeterension (r=0.496–0.860) and the functional interference diMeterension (r=0.517– 0.712) of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and the EuroQol-5 DiMeterension (r=0.527–0.743). Three factors resulted using exploratory factor analysis: pain severity, activity interference, and eMeterotional interference, accounting for 79.0% of the total variance. Standard error of MetereasureMeterent was 0.539.BPrincipal investigator-CV has good feasibility, reliability, and validity. It can be recoMeterMeterended for KOsteoarthritis patients in Meterainland China.
