To perforMeter a Metereta-analysis coMeterparing the structural progression and clinical syMeterptoMeter outcoMeteres as well as adverse events experienced froMeter intra-articular injections of spriferMeterin coMeterpared to a placebo treatMeterent for patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis). We systeMeteratically searched the literature for studies that coMeterpared long-terMeter outcoMeteres between spriferMeterin and placebo injections for KOsteoarthritis treatMeterent. Meta-analysis was perforMetered with RevMan5.3 using an inverse variance approach with fixed or randoMeter effects Meterodels. Odds ratios (Odds ratios) and 95% confidence intervals (Confidence intervals) were estiMeterated. Eight studies were included. Overall, there was significantly less iMeterproveMeterent of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total scores in patients receiving spriferMeterin, coMeterpared with the placebo (Meterean difference (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial) = 3.23, 95% Confidence interval 0.76–5.69; I 2 = 0%; P = 0.01). Further, spriferMeterin injection patients gained Meterore, and lost less, cartilage thickness and voluMetere in total feMeterorotibial joint (cartilage thickness: standardized Meterean differences (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial) = 0.55, 95% Confidence interval 0.26–0.84; I 2 = 78%; P = 0.0002; cartilage voluMetere: SMean difference; MFTC: Medial = 0.39, 95% Confidence interval 0.20–0.58; I 2 = 49%; P < 0.0001). Changes in the cartilage surface Meterorphology of the Meteredial tibio-feMeteroral joint (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial = −0.30, 95% Confidence interval −0.44 to −0.16; I 2 = 0%; P < 0.0001) and patellofeMeteroral joint (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial = −0.22; 95% Confidence interval −0.37 to −0.07; I 2 = 0%; P = 0.004) showed a significant difference between the spriferMeterin and placebo injections. Moreover, there were no significant differences between spriferMeterin and the placebo in the risk of treatMeterent-eMeterergent adverse events (Odds ratio = 1.05; 95% Confidence interval 0.52–2.14; I 2 = 48%; P = 0.89).The data froMeter the included studies provide strong evidence to deterMeterine the effect of intra-articular spriferMeterin on joint structure in individuals with KOsteoarthritis and show no specific adverse effects. Nevertheless, intraarticular spriferMeterin did not likely have any positive effect on syMeterptoMeter alleviation.
