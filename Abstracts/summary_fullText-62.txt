The primary purpose of this study is to assess the existing evidence on the cost-effectiveness of surgical interventions for the management of knee and hip osteoarthritis by systematically reviewing published economic evaluation studies.A systematic review was conducted for the period 2004 to 2016. Electronic databases were searched to identify both trial and model based economic evaluation studies that evaluated surgical interventions for knee and hip osteoarthritis.A total of 23 studies met the inclusion criteria and an assessment of these studies showed that total knee arthroplasty (Total knee arthroplasty;), and total hip arthroplasty (THyaluronic acid;) showed evidence of cost-effectiveness and improvement in quality of life of the patients when compared to non-operative and non-surgical procedures. On the other hand, even though delaying Total knee arthroplasty; and THyaluronic acid; may lead to some cost savings in the short-run, the results from the study showed that this was not a cost-effective option. Total knee arthroplasty; and THyaluronic acid; are cost-effective and should be recommended for the management of patients with end stage/severe knee and hip Osteoarthritis;. However, there needs to be additional studies to assess the cost-effectiveness of other surgical interventions in order for definite conclusions to be reached.
