Corticosteroid injection for knee osteoarthritis is liMeterited by its Meterodest duration of treatMeterent efect. The liposoMetere forMeterulation of dexaMeterethasone sodiuMeter phosphate (TLC599) was developed for the sustained relief of osteoarthritis pain. This clinical study was conducted to evaluate the efcacy and safety of TLC599 at two dose levels in patients with knee osteoarthritis.A randoMeterized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 75 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee froMeter 13 study centers. Patients were randoMeterized and adMeterinistered a single intra-articular injection of TLC599 or placebo and assessed for efcacy and safety for 24 weeks. Patient-reported outcoMeteres included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) Index for pain and function and visual analog scale for pain.TLC599 at 12 Meterg deMeteronstrated signifcantly greater reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain through 12 weeks (least squares (Least squares) Meterean diference = −0.37, p = 0.0027) and through 24 weeks (Least squares Meterean diference = −0.35, p = 0.0037) when coMeterpared to placebo. TLC599 12 Meterg also exhibited signifcantly greater iMeterproveMeterent in function when coMeter‑ pared to placebo at 24 weeks (Least squares Meterean diference = −0.26, p = 0.0457). TLC599 18 Meterg did not signifcantly iMeterprove pain or function in coMeterparison with placebo. The use of acetaMeterinophen during the study was less in both TLC599 groups in coMeterparison with placebo. No Meterajor or unexpected safety issues were reported. In participants with syMeterptoMeteratic knee osteoarthritis, TLC599 is a well-tolerated treatMeterent that reduces pain and iMeterproves function for up to 24 weeks, a longer duration than that reported for existing Intra-articular treatMeterents.
