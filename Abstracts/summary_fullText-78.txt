To investigate the infuence of osteophytes on postoperative gap balancing, and to work out a predictive model of the relationship between osteophyte size and gap gaining in primary total knee replacement. One hundred and ten patients were enrolled in the study. Pre- and postoperative radiographs were collected and analyzed. They were assigned to the training dataset and test dataset randomly at a ratio of 9:1 by using the statistical package R (version 4.0.5). Size and marginal distances of osteophytes, planned bone cut planes, predicted bone cuts and joint gaps were labeled on the preoperative standing anteroposterior and lateral views, while actual bone cuts and joint gaps were recorded on the postoperative plain flms, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed. Actual joint gaps were signifcantly related to the distances of medial and lateral predictive bone cutting lines, bone cut thickness on tibial side and posterior condylar, as well as size and marginal distances of osteophytes (P<0.05). A predictive equation was generated, with a root mean square error (Repetition maximum.SE) of 3.4761 in validation. A 2-D planning system with adjustable input parameters and dim predictive outputs on joint gap was developed. The equation is S(JointGap) = 1.82+0.15∗y+0.552∗Tibialcut+0.953∗Femoralcut+0.197∗PostCondyle Postoperative joint gap can be predicted on the basis of preoperative measurements on 2-D plain flms. Larger sample size may help improve the efectiveness and accuracy of the predictive equation.
