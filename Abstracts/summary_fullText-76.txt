Presence of supracondylar and periarticular femoral fracture with associated arthritis of knee poses a challenging situation to the orthopaedic surgeon. The results of fxation of fracture in osteoporosis are not very satisfactory and have complications. With fxation alone, they still cannot bear weight on afected leg due to severe disability of osteoarthritis. To make patient walk, conventionally three surgeries in the form of fracture fxation, removal of implant and total knee arthroplasty (Total knee arthroplasty;) needs to be done in staged manner. We propose a novel management in form of bifold fxation and simultaneous Total knee arthroplasty;. Eight cases (6 females, 2 males) of supracondylar femoral fractures with severe osteoarthritis of the knee and osteoporosis were primarily fxed with bifold fxation using SIGN nail (www.signfracturecare.org) and locking plate together with simultaneous total knee arthroplasty. There were fve cases (2 males and 3 females) of grade 4 (Kellgren-Lawrence grading) osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis;) and three cases (all females) of severe rheumatoid arthritis (Rheumatoid Arthritis;). The mean age was 68 years and average time for full weight bearing was 6days. Radiographic evidence of fracture union was achieved in 16.25weeks. The mean Knee Society Score (Knee Society Score;) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis instrument;) score at 26months was 83.13 and 22.13 respectively. Single stage combined bifold osteosynthesis with interlocking nail and locking plate together with total knee arthroplasty helps in one time management of these difcult injuries. It is a cost-efective and economically sound option and gives excellent results with good patient satisfaction.
