Celastrol has been proven efective in anti-infammatory but was limited in the clinic due to the poor solubility and side efects induced by low bioavailability. Osteoarthritis has acidic and infammatory environment. Our aim was to load celastrol into Hmass spectrometry;Ns and capped with chitosan to construct a pH-responsive nanoparticle medicine (Celastrol;@Hmass spectrometry;Ns-Chitosan;), which is of high solubility for osteoarthritis intra-articular injection treatment.The Celastrol;@Hmass spectrometry;Ns-Chitosan; were assembled and the characteristics were measured. The Celastrol;@Hmass spectrometry;Ns-Chitosan; was applied in vitro in the chondrocytes collected from rats cartilage tissue and in vivo in the Multiple Imputation;ntraarticular; induced knee osteo‑ arthritis rats via intra-articular injection. Cytotoxicity assay, pH-responsive release, pain behavior, magnetic resonance imaging;, safranin o fast green staining, ELISA and western blot analysis were applied to evaluate the bioavailability and therapeutic efect of Celastrol;@Hmass spectrometry;Ns-Chitosan;.Celastrol;@Hmass spectrometry;Ns-Chitosan; was stable due to the protection of the chitosan layers in alkaline environment (pH=7.7) but revealed good solubility and therapeutic efect in acidic environment (pH=6.0). The cytotoxicity assay showed no cytotoxicity at relatively low concentration (200 μg/mL) and the cell viability of chondrocytes stimulated by interleukin;-1β was increased in Celastrol;@Hmass spectrometry;Ns-Chitosan; group. Paw withdrawal threshold in Celastrol;@Hmass spectrometry;Ns-Chitosan; group is increased, and magnetic resonance imaging; and Safranin O Fast Green staining showed improvements in articular surface erosion and joint efusion. The upregulated expression levels of interleukin;-1β, Tissue Necrosis Factor-alpha, interleukin;-6, Matrix metalloproteinases;-3 and Matrix metalloproteinases;-13 and Nuclear factor kappa-B; signaling pathway of chondrocytes were inhib‑ ited in Celastrol;@Hmass spectrometry;Ns-Chitosan; group.Hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles were an ideal carrier for natural drugs with poor solubility and were of high biocompatibility for intra-articular injection. These intra-articular injectable Celastrol;@Hmass spectrometry;Ns-Chitosan; with improved solubility, present a pH-responsive therapeutic strategy against osteoarthritis.
