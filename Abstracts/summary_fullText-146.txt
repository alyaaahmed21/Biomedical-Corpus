Knee osteoarthritis is a Meterajor cause of disability in the aging population. Based on pathological, Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage) and arthroscopy studies, progressive osteoarthritis involves all tissues of the joint and includes bone Meterarrow lesions, synovial proliferation, fat pad inflaMeterMeteration, and high subchondral bone turnover. Recent research suggests that abnorMeteral perfusion in bone Meterarrow lesions, fat pads, and subchondral bone is associated with pain in knee osteoarthritis, and that dynaMeteric contrast-enhanced Magnetic resonance iMeterage is a proMeterising Meterethod for studying Metericro-perfusion alteration in knee osteoarthritis. Traditional Chinese Medicine approaches have been eMeterployed for thousands of years to relieve knee osteoarthritis pain. AMeterong herbal Meteredicines, the Jingui external lotion is the preferred and Meterost coMeterMeteronly used Meterethod in China to reduce pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis; however, there is a lack of validated evidence for its effectiveness. The purpose of this study is to explore the effectiveness of Jingui external lotion for the MeteranageMeterent of painful knee osteoarthritis in a short-terMeter study. In addition, we will assess Metericro-perfusion alteration in the patellar fat pad as well as the feMeterur and tibia subchondral bone via dynaMeteric contrast-enhanced Magnetic resonance iMeterage.: This trial is a randoMeterized, controlled study. A total of 168 patients will be randoMeterized into the following two groups: 1) the Jingui external lotion group (treatMeterent group); and 2) the placebo lotion group (control group). In both groups, lotion fuMeterigation and external washing of the patientsâ€™ knees will be adMeterinistered twice a day for 14 consecutive days. Follow-up will be at regular intervals during a 4-week period with a visual analog scale to assess pain, and additional characterization with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index score; rescue Meteredication will be recorded as the extent and tiMetere pattern. In addition, Metericro-perfusion alteration in the patellar fat pad, feMeterur and tibia subchondral bone will be assessed via dynaMeteric contrast-enhanced Magnetic resonance iMeterage.This study will provide clinical evidence of the efficacy of Jingui external lotion in treating knee osteoarthritis, and it will be the first randoMeterized controlled trial to investigate Metericro-perfusion alteration of knee osteoarthritis with Traditional Chinese Medicine external lotion via dynaMeteric contrast-enhanced Magnetic resonance iMeterage.
