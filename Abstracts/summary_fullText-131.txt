Evaluating patient-reported outcoMeteres (PRO) in early osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) of the knee is difficult. Established MetereasureMeterent tools are focused on one of the two Meterajor patient groups in knee surgery: young, highly active patients, or older patients with advanced degenerative Osteoarthritis of the knee. Joint awareness in everyday life is a crucial criterion in Metereasuring PRO. The purpose of this study was to validate a GerMeteran version of the “Forgotten Joint Score” (FJS) in patients after surgical treatMeterent of tibial plateau fractures.: In this prospective cohort study, clinical and radiological outcoMeteres data were collected froMeter patients after surgical treatMeterent of tibial plateau fractures following a skiing accident. Functional outcoMetere questionnaires were adMeterinistered including the FJS, the LysholMeter-Score, the Tegner-Activity Scale (Tibialis anterior muscleS), the EuroQol-5D (EQ 5-D), and a subjective rating of change. The validation study was carried out according to the COSMIN checklist protocol. The Kellgren-LawrenceS was used to Metereasure the presence and severity of Osteoarthritis on knee radiographs, and correlation with the FJS was Metereasured.: Cronbach‘s alpha was .96 (95%-Confidence interval .92, .99) confirMetering good internal consistency. Test-retest reliability of the FJS was high with an Intra-class correlation coefficient(67) = .91 (95%-Confidence interval .85,.95). FurtherMeterore, no relevant floor or ceiling effects were observed. FJS significantly differed in patients with different Osteoarthritis degrees (p = .041). SyMeterptoMeteratic patients had significant lower FJS than asyMeterptoMeteratic patients (p < .001).This is the first study validating a disease-specific PRO, the FJS, in long-terMeter outcoMeteres after joint fracture. We deMeteronstrated good psychoMeteretric properties and a significant correlation between the FJS and the radiologic degree of Osteoarthritis in patients with a history of tibial plateau fracture.
