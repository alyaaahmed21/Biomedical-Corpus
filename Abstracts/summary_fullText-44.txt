Intra-articular (Intraarticular;) corticosteroid injection is recommended in refractory knee osteoarthritis patients. However, 40-mg of triamcinolone Intraarticular; every 3 months for 2 years reduces cartilage volume as compared to saline Intraarticular;. To determine the non-inferiority of 10-mg versus 40-mg of triamcinolone acetonide (TA) for treatment of pain in symptomatic knee osteoarthritis at week 12. This was a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial conducted in 84 symptomatic knee osteoarthritis patients. The 10-mg or 40-mg of TA were 1:1 randomized and injected to the afected knees. The primary outcome was the 12-week diference from baseline in pain Visual analogue scale;, with a pre-specifed lower margin for non-inferiority of 10 mm. The measuring instruments used were: Visual analog scale (Visual analogue scale;: 0â€“10), modifed Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index), EuroQuartiles;ol Group 5 Dimensions (EQuartiles;5D), Knee Injuries and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score;) questionnaire, chair standing test and 20-m walking time at baseline, at week 4, and week 12 after randomization. Adverse events were recorded. Baseline characteristics were similar between two groups. The mean diferences of pain Visual analogue scale; (95% confdence interval: Confidence interval;) between the two groups at baseline and week 12 were 0.8 (-0.8, 2.4) with p of 0.002 for non-inferiority. There were no diferences in pain reduction and quality of life improvement between 10-mg and 40-mg groups. The mean diferences (95%Confidence interval;) of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score; pain, EQuartiles;5D and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score; quality of life between baseline and week 12 were 0.4 (-1.1, 1.9). -8.7 (-21.3, 3.9), 1.3(-7.1, 9.6) and 1.8 (-11.5, 15.0), respectively. The 10 mg of TA is non-inferior to 40 mg TA in improving pain in patients with symptomatic knee Osteoarthritis;. Both 10 mg and 40 mg of TA signifcantly improved pain and quality of life in patients with symptomatic knee Osteoarthritis;.
