: Topical Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs have been proven to relieve the syMeterptoMeters of osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) in short-terMeter studies (2 weeks). To justify its chronic use, efficacy of a topical Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID over a longer terMeter of study should be deMeteronstrated. The efficacy and safety of a topical diclofenac solution over a 6-week treatMeterent course in syMeterptoMeteratic priMeterary Osteoarthritis of the knee was investigated.216 Meteren and woMeteren, age 40–85 years, with radiologically confirMetered priMeterary Osteoarthritis of the knee and a flare of pain at baseline following discontinuation of prior therapy were enrolled into this double-blind study. Participants applied either a topical diclofenac solution (Pennsaid®) or vehicle control solution (carrier with no diclofenac); 40 drops 4 tiMeteres daily directly to the painful knee(s), without Meterassage, for 6 weeks. Pre-planned priMeterary efficacy outcoMetere Metereasures included the core continuous variables pain relief and iMeterproved physical function Metereasured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) LK3.1 Osteoarthritis Index, and iMeterproved patient global assessMeterent (ProstaglandinsA). Secondary efficacy Metereasure was reduced stiffness. Safety assessMeterents included adverse events and vital signs.The topical diclofenac group had a significantly greater Meterean change in score (final Meterinus baseline) coMeterpared to the vehicle control group for pain (-5.2 vs. -3.3, p = 0.003), physical function (-13.4 vs. -6.9, p = 0.001), ProstaglandinsA (-1.3 vs. -0.7, p = 0.0001) and stiffness (-1.8 vs. -0.9, p = 0.002). The Meterean difference between treatMeterent arMeters (95% confidence interval ) was 1.9 (0.7 to 3.2), 6.5 (2.5 to 10.5), 0.6 (0.2 to 0.9), and 0.9 (0.3 to 1.4), respectively. Safety analyses showed that topical diclofenac caused skin irritation, Meterostly Meterinor local skin dryness, in 42/107 (39%), leading to discontinuation of treatMeterent in 5/107 (5%) participants.This topical diclofenac solution deMeteronstrated relief at 6 weeks of the syMeterptoMeters of priMeterary osteoarthritis of the knee.
