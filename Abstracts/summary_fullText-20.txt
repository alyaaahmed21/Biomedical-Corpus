Although recent advances in knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis;) treatment and evaluation were achieved, to the best of our knowledge, few studies have evaluated the longitudinal effect of therapeutic modalities on the functional exercise capacity of patients with knee Osteoarthritis;. The purpose was to investigate the effects of kinesiotherapy and electrotherapy on functional exercise capacity, evaluated using the six-minute walk test (6-MWT) in patients with bilateral knee Osteoarthritis;. Secondary measurements included range of motion (Range of motion;), severity of knee pain (Visual analog score;), and a measure of perceived health and physical function, evaluated using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (Western Ontario McMaster Universities.) Osteoarthritis Index.A total of 40 women with bilateral knee Osteoarthritis; were assigned to three groups: kinesiotherapy (KIN, n = 16), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS, n = 12), or ultrasound (United States., n = 10). The groups underwent 12 weeks of intervention twice per week. The participants were subjected to the 6-MWT, Range of motion;, Visual analog score; and Western Ontario McMaster Universities. index. These tests were performed before and after the intervention. The study was focused on outpatients and was carried out at Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Brazil. At follow-up, the KIN and United States. groups had significantly higher 6-MWT distances (19.8 ± 21.7 and 14.1 ± 22.5%, respectively) compared with their respective pre-intervention values. All treatments were effective for reducing pain and improving the Western Ontario McMaster Universities. index. We demonstrated that the 6-MWT is a tool that can be used to evaluate improvements in the functional exercise capacity of patients submitted to a clinical intervention.
