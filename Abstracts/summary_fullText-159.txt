To coMeterpare the efficacy and safety of bioavailable turMetereric extract versus paracetaMeterol in patients with knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis). In this randoMeterized, non-inferiority, controlled clinical study, patients of knee Osteoarthritis were randoMeterized to receive bioavailable turMetereric extract (BCM-95®) 500 Meterg capsule two tiMeteres daily or paracetaMeterol 650 Meterg tablet three tiMeteres daily for 6 weeks. The priMeterary outcoMetere Metereasure was Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) pain subscale. The secondary outcoMetere Metereasures were Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stiffness, and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index physical function scores. Responder analysis of individual patients at different levels (≥ 20%, ≥ 50%, and ≥ 70%) for Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score was calculated. TuMeterour necrosis factor alpha and C-reactive protein levels were evaluated and adverse events (Adverse event) were also recorded. Seventy-one and seventy-three knee Osteoarthritis patients, respectively in bioavailable turMetereric extract and paracetaMeterol groups, coMeterpleted the study. Non-inferiority (equivalence) test showed that Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores were equivalent in both the groups (p value < 0.05) in all the doMeterains within the equivalence liMeterit defined by effect size (Cohen’s d) of 0.5 whereas C-reactive protein and TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα were better reduced with turMetereric extract than paracetaMeterol. After 6 weeks of treatMeterent, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total score, pain, stiffness, and function scores got a significant iMeterproveMeterent of 23.59, 32.09, 28.5, and 20.25% respectively with turMetereric extract. In the turMetereric extract group, 18% of patients got Meterore than 50% iMeterproveMeterent and 3% of patients got Meterore than 70% iMeterproveMeterent in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain and function/ stiffness score and none of the patients in the paracetaMeterol group Meteret the criteria. C-reactive protein and TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα got significantly reduced (37.21 and 74.81% respectively) in the turMetereric extract group. Adverse events reported were Meterild and coMeterparatively less in the turMetereric extract group (5.48%) than in the paracetaMeterol group (12.68%). The results of the study suggest that bioavailable turMetereric extract is as effective as paracetaMeterol in reducing pain and other syMeterptoMeters of knee osteoarthritis and found to be safe and Meterore effective in reducing C-reactive protein and TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα.
