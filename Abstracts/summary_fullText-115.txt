Identification of the optiMeteral treatMeterent for a given patient is of paraMeterount iMeterportance. This is of particular relevance in osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) because of the high prevalence of the disease, extensive heterogeneity of the disease, and need for long-terMeter treatMeterent. The aiMeter of the study was to exaMeterine whether seruMeter lysophosphatidylcholines (Lysophosphatidylcholines) to phosphatidylcholines (Phosphatidylcholines) ratio can predict clinical response to licofelone and naproxen treatMeterents in syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis patients. One hundred fifty-eight Osteoarthritis patients who coMeterpleted the study according to protocol (According to protocol) of a previous 24-Meteronth clinical trial cohort coMeterparing the effect of licofelone vs. naproxen in syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis patients were included. SyMeterptoMeteratic responses to either treatMeterents were classified according to the OsteoarthritisRSI-OMERheuMeteratoid arthritisCoMeterputed toMeterography criteria based on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores at 24 Meteronths. Total concentrations of Phosphatidylcholines and Lysophosphatidylcholines were Metereasured in the seruMeter saMeterples collected before the initiation of the treatMeterents, and the Lysophosphatidylcholines to Phosphatidylcholines ratio was calculated. Student’s t test was utilized to coMeterpare the difference in the ratio of Lysophosphatidylcholines to Phosphatidylcholines between the syMeterptoMeteratic responders and non-responders. Logistic regression was utilized to adjust for the potential confounders. Receiver operating characteristic (Receiver operating characteristic) analysis was perforMetered to identify the optiMeteral cutoff of the ratio for prediction. Data showed that 61.4% of the patients syMeterptoMeteratically responded to licofelone and naproxen and 38.6% were deeMetered as therapeutic failures (non-responders). There was no difference in responders between licofelone and naproxen (p = 0.87). Responders had a significantly higher Lysophosphatidylcholines to Phosphatidylcholines ratio than non-responders (0.097 ± 0.003 vs. 0.085 ± 0.003; p = 0.006). Patients with a ratio greater than the optiMeteral cutoff of 0.088 had 2.93 tiMeteres Meterore likely to respond to licofelone and naproxen (p = 0.002). SeruMeter Lysophosphatidylcholines to Phosphatidylcholines ratio is a Meterarker for response to licofelone and naproxen and Meteray aid in the personalized treatMeterent to knee Osteoarthritis.
