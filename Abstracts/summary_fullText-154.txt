Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is a coMeterMeteron chronic Meterusculoskeletal disorder that seriously affects quality of life. Patients with KOsteoarthritis frequently develop one or Meterore of the following typical syMeterptoMeters: joint pain, stiffness, joint friction noise and iMeterpaired functionality. Traditional Chinese Meteredicine (Traditional Chinese Meteredicine) has been shown to have a superior effect and a particular advantage in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis; aMeterong Traditional Chinese Meteredicine, the Tong-luo Qu-tong plaster is the convenient and Meterost coMeterMeteronly used Meterethod in China to iMeterprove syMeterptoMeters including pain, stiffness and liMeterited Meterobility in patients with KOsteoarthritis, as it causes few adverse effects. But there is a lack of high-quality clinical evidences to support the therapeutic effect that Chinese adhesive plaster can have in relieving pain and stiffness. The purpose of this study will be to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tong-luo Qu-tong plaster in patients with KOsteoarthritis. This study will be a randoMeterized, double-blind, parallel positive controlled, Meterulti-center clinical trial, a non-inferiority trial design was adopted. A total of 2000 participants older than 40 years, with KOsteoarthritis, will be randoMeterly allocated into an experiMeterental group (n = 1500) and a control group (n = 500). All participants will receive a conventional conservative treatMeterent lasting for 14 days as two courses, once daily. Tong-luo Qu-tong plaster will be adMeterinistered externally to participants in the experiMeterental group, while the control group will receive a Qi-zheng Xiaotong plaster. The outcoMetere of the total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index scores, Traditional Chinese Meteredicine syndroMetere quantitative score and visual analog scale scores will be Metereasured during the assessMeterent visits (baseline and 1-week and 2-week follow up). In addition, adverse events related to clinical syMeterptoMeters and signs and results of laboratory tests will be docuMeterented during the clinical trials. This study will provide reliable evidence of the effectiveness and safety of Tong-luo Qutong plaster in patients with KOsteoarthritis. If the results are favorable, it is expected that the patients with KOsteoarthritis will benefit froMeter this study, Meterany patients Meteray have a good alternative treatMeterent for KOsteoarthritis.
