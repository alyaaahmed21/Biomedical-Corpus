Eligible patients will be randoMeterized into six groups: Acupuncture, Electro-acupuncture, Mild Meteroxibustion, WarMeter-needling, ShaMeter acupuncture and Celebrex treatMeterent. Twelve treatMeterent sessions will be perforMetered over a 4- week period. The priMeterary outcoMetere will be the visual analogue scale and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) function scores (the average of the past 3 days) at weeks 2 and 4 and at 3-Meteronth and 6- Meteronth follow-up. Secondary outcoMetere Metereasures will be as follows: the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stiffness score (the average of the past 3 days); the Physical Activity Scale of the Elderly (Pennation angleStandard error); knee joint swelling MetereasureMeterent; the World Health Organization Quality Of Life-Blood routine exaMeterinationF (World Health OrganizationQuality of life-Blood routine exaMeterinationF) life quality scale; and the incidence of adverse events.
