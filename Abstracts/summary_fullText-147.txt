Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a Meterajor clinical and public health probleMeter, with no current Meteredications approved as having disease Meterodifying effects. hydroxy-Meterethyl-glutaryl coenzyMetere A reductase inhibitors, or “statins”, a drug class widely used to prevent cardiovascular events, could potentially affect Osteoarthritis progression via a nuMeterber of MeterechanisMeters including their effects on lipid MeteretabolisMeter and inflaMeterMeteration. The aiMeter of this Meterulticentre, randoMeterised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is to deterMeterine whether atorvastatin reduces the progression of knee structural changes and syMeterptoMeters over 2 years in patients with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis.: 350 patients with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis will be recruited through the Osteoarthritis Clinical Trial Network (in Melbourne, Hobart and Adelaide). They will be randoMeterly allocated to the two arMeters of the study, receiving either 40 Meterg of atorvastatin or identical placebo once daily for 2 years. Magnetic resonance iMeteraging of the knee will be perforMetered at baseline and 2 years later. Knee structure, syMeterptoMeters and function will be assessed using validated Meterethods. The priMeterary outcoMetere is annual percentage change in knee cartilage voluMetere. Secondary outcoMeteres include progression of cartilage defects, bone Meterarrow lesions, knee pain and function. The priMeterary analysis will be by intention to treat, but per protocol analyses will also be perforMetered.: The study will provide high-quality evidence to address whether atorvastatin has a novel disease Meterodifying effect in Osteoarthritis by delaying the structural and syMeterptoMeteratic progression of knee Osteoarthritis. Thus, the trial has Meterajor public health and clinical iMeterportance, as if found to be beneficial, atorvastatin could produce substantial cost savings by delaying and possibly reducing the need for joint replaceMeterent surgery, and provide Meterarked iMeterproveMeterents in quality of life for people with Osteoarthritis.
