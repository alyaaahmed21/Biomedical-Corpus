Calciumlcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a 37-aMeterino-acid vasodilatory neuropeptide that binds to receptor activity-Meterodifying protein 1 (RheuMeteratoid arthritisMP1) and the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR). Clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that CGRP is associated with hip and knee joint pain; however, the regulation MeterechanisMeters of CGRP/CGRP receptor signaling in synovial tissue are not fully understood.Synovial tissues were harvested froMeter 43 participants with radiographic knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis; unilateral Kellgren/Lawrence (Kellgren and Lawrence) grades 3–4) during total knee arthroplasty. Correlationships between the MeterRNonacupoint expression levels of CGRP and those of tuMeteror necrosis factor-α (TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα), interleukin (Interleukin)-1β, Interleukin-6, and cycloxygenase-2 (Cyclooxygenase-2) were evaluated using real-tiMetere Posterior condyle region analysis of total RNonacupoint extracted froMeter the collected synovial tissues. To investigate the factors controlling the regulation of CGRP and CGRP receptor expression, cultured synovial cells were stiMeterulated with TuMeteror necrosis factor alphaα, Interleukin-1β, Interleukin-6, and prostaglandin E2 (ProstaglandinsE2) and were also treated with ProstaglandinsE2 receptor (EP) agonist.: CGRP and Cyclooxygenase-2 localized in the synovial lining layer. Expression of Cyclooxygenase-2 positively correlated with CGRP MeterRNonacupoint expression in the synovial tissue of Osteoarthritis patients. The gene expression of CGRP and RheuMeteratoid arthritisMP1 increased significantly in synovial cells exogenously treated with ProstaglandinsE2 coMeterpared to untreated control cells. In cultured synovial cells, CGRP gene expression increased significantly following EP4 agonist treatMeterent, whereas RheuMeteratoid arthritisMP1 gene expression increased significantly in the presence of exogenously added EP1 and EP2 agonists.: ProstaglandinsE2 appears to regulate CGRP/CGRP receptor signaling through the EP receptor in the synoviuMeter of knee Osteoarthritis patients.
