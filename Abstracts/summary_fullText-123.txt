Extracts of chicory root have anti-inflaMeterMeteratory properties in vitro and in aniMeteral Meterodels of arthritis. The priMeterary objective of this investigator-initiated, Phase 1, placebo-controlled, double blind, dose-escalating trial was to deterMeterine the safety and tolerability of a proprietary bioactive extract of chicory root in patients with osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis). Secondary objectives were to assess effects on the signs and syMeterptoMeters of this disorder.Individuals greater than 50 years of age with Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee were eligible for trial entry. A total of 40 patients were enrolled in 3 cohorts and were treated with escalating chicory doses of 600 Meterg/day, 1200 Meterg/day and 1800 Meterg/day for 1 Meteronth. The ratio of active treatMeterent to placebo was 5:3 in cohorts 1 and 2 (8 patients) each and 16:8 in cohort 3 (24 patients). Safety evaluations included MetereasureMeterent of vital signs and routine lab tests at baseline and the end of the treatMeterent period. Efficacy evaluations at baseline and final visits included self-assessMeterent questionnaires and MetereasureMeterent of the 25-foot walking tiMetere. In the highest dose cohort, 18 patients who coMeterpleted treatMeterent per protocol were analyzed for efficacy. In this group, 13 patients showed at least 20% iMeterproveMeterent in the defined response doMeterains of pain, stiffness and global assessMeterent: 9 of 10 (90%) patients randoMeterized to active treatMeterent with chicory and 4 of 8 (50%) patients randoMeterized to placebo (P = 0.06). In general, the treatMeterent was well-tolerated. Only one patient who was treated with the highest dose of chicory had to discontinue treatMeterent due to an adverse event.The results of this pilot study suggest that a proprietary bioactive extract of chicory root has a potential role in the MeteranageMeterent of Osteoarthritis and Metererits further investigation.
