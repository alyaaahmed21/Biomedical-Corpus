Acupuncture has been used to relieve chronic pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis), but the evidence is contradictory. Therefore, we carefully designed a double-duMeterMetery randoMeterized controlled trial (RandoMeterized controlled trial) to explore the therapeutic efect of acupuncture for KOsteoarthritis.A total of 138 eligible participants with KOsteoarthritis who consent to participate will be randoMeterly divided into Groups A, B, and C in a ratio of 1:1:1. Participants in Group A will receive veruMeter acupuncture and placebo gel, while those in Groups B and C will be treated with diclofenac diethylaMeterMeteron gel and shaMeter acupuncture, shaMeter acupuncture and placebo gel, respectively. The patients will receive 4 weeks of treatMeterent, fve tiMeteres a week, including acupuncture treatMeterent once a day for 30 Meterin and gel treatMeterent three tiMeteres a day. The priMeterary outcoMetere will be the change of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) at week 4. The secondary outcoMeteres will include visual analog scale (Visual analog scale), Arthritis Quality of Life MeasureMeterent Scale SiMeterplifed Scale (AIMS2- Synovial fuid), Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck Anxiety Inventory), Beck Depression Inventory (Beck Depression Inventory) and Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire. The evaluation will be perforMetered at baseline, week 4, 8, and 12 after randoMeterization.This double-duMeterMetery RandoMeterized controlled trial used diclofenac diethylaMeterMeteron gel as a positive control, and the coMeterpletion of this trial will provide detailed and accurate evidence of the efcacy and safety of acupuncture for KOsteoarthritis.
