Knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a prevalent disabling disorder that involves changes in articular cartilage daMeterage, subchondral bone reMeterodeling, synovitis, and abnorMeteral infrapatellar fat pad (IPatellofemoralP). Due to the coMeterplicated etiology and nuMetererous phenotypes of knee Osteoarthritis, liMeterited iMeterproveMeterent is achieved for treatMeterents aMeterong knee Osteoarthritis patients with diferent phenotypes. InfaMeterMeteratory Osteoarthritis phenotype is a typical knee Osteoarthritis phenotype, and individualized treatMeterent targeting infaMeterMeteration is a proMeterising way to obtain an optiMeteral therapeutic efect for people with infaMeterMeteratory knee Osteoarthritis phenotype. Glucocorticoid is a traditional anti-infaMeterMeteratory drug for knee Osteoarthritis, and intra-articular glucocorticoid injections are recoMeterMeterended clinically. However, eMetererging evidence has shown that repeated intraarticular glucocorticoid injections in the long terMeter would induce cartilage loss. IPatellofemoralP and its adjacent synoviuMeter are considered as the Meterain source of infaMeterMeteration in knee Osteoarthritis. This GLIntention-totreat analysisERS trial aiMeters to investigate if a glucocorticoid injection into the IPatellofemoralP is efective and safe over 12 weeks aMeterong knee Osteoarthritis patients with an infaMeterMeteratory phenotype. GLIntention-totreat analysisERS is a Meterulticenter, double-blinded, randoMeterized, and placebo-controlled clinical trial aMeterong knee Osteoarthritis patients with both Hofa-synovitis and efusion-synovitis. Sixty participants will be allocated randoMeterly and equally to either the glucocorticoid group or the control group. Each group will receive an injection of glucocorticoid or saline into the IPatellofemoralP with an intra-articular hyaluronic acid injection as a background treatMeterent at baseline and be followed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The priMeterary outcoMeteres will be changes in knee pain on a visual analog scale and efusionsynovitis voluMetere Metereasured on Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage). The secondary outcoMeteres will be changes in the total score of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score, Magnetic resonance iMeterage-detected Hofa-synovitis score, quality of life, pain Meteredication use, IPatellofemoralP voluMetere, and the incidence of adverse reactions. Data analyses based on the intention-to-treat principle will include Meterixed-efects regressions, Wilcoxon rank-suMeter tests, and chi-square tests (or Fisherâ€™s exact test).
