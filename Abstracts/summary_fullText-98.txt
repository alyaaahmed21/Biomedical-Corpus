Clinical recommendations suggest exercises as the main treatment modality for patients with knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis;). This study aimed to compare the effects of two different exercise interventions, i.e., open kinetic chain (Open kinetic chain;) and closed kinetic chain (Closed kinetic chain;) exercises, on the pain and lower limb biomechanics of patients with mild knee Osteoarthritis;. A total of 66 individuals with painful early knee Osteoarthritis;, aged 50 years and above, with body mass index (Body mass index;) between 18.9kg/m2 and 29.9 kg/m2 in Kelantan, Malaysia, will be recruited in this study. Participants will be randomly allocated into three different groups, either the Open kinetic chain;, Closed kinetic chain;, or control groups. All three groups will attend an individual session with a physiotherapist. The participants in the Open kinetic chain; and Closed kinetic chain; groups will perform the exercises three times weekly for 8 weeks at their home. The control group will receive education about clinical manifestations, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and nursing care for knee via printed materials. The primary outcomes include self-reported pain scores (visual analog scale), disability scores (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index), and quality of life scores (Osteoarthritis Knee and Hip Quality of Life). Secondary outcomes include lower limb biomechanics during gait and sit-to-stand as well as isokinetic knee strength. The outcomes will be measured before and after the intervention. The present study will compare the effects of two different home-based exercise intervention programs among patients with mild knee Osteoarthritis;. The study findings will provide vital information that can be used to design an effective exercise program that aims at delaying the Osteoarthritis; progression.
