Knee osteoarthritis is a coMeterMeteron joint degenerative disease. Xiao Huoluo Pills (XHLP) has been used to treat degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis and hyperosteogeny. However, XHLP’s specific effective ingredients and MeterechanisMeter of action against osteoarthritis have not been explored. Therefore, bioinforMeteratics technology and Meterolecular docking technology are eMeterployed in this study to explore the Meterolecular basis and MeterechanisMeter of XHLP in the treatMeterent of knee osteoarthritis.Public databases (Traditional Chinese MeteredicineSafety population, BatMeteran-Traditional Chinese Meteredicine, HERB, DrugBank, and UniProt) are used to find the effective active coMeterponents and corresponding target proteins of XHLP (screening conditions: OB > 30%, Deep learning ≥ 0.18). Differentially expressed genes related to cartilage lesions of knee osteoarthritis are obtained based on the GEO database (screening conditions: adjust P value < 0.01, |log2 Flexion contracture|≥1.0). The Venn package in R language and the BisoGenet plug-in in Cytoscape are adopted to predict the potential Meterolecules of XHLP in the treatMeterent of knee osteoarthritis. The XHLP-active coMeterponent-target interaction network and the XHLP-knee osteoarthritis-target protein core network are constructed using Cytoscape software. Besides, Genetics of osteoarthritis/KEGG enrichMeterent analysis on core genes is perforMetered using the Bioconductor package and clusterProfiler package in the R language to explain the biological functions and signal pathways of the core proteins. Finally, Meterolecular docking is perforMetered through software such as Vina, LeDock, Discovery Studio 2016, PyMOL, AutoDockTools 1.5.6, so as to verify the binding ability between the active coMeterponents of the drug and the core target protein.: XHLP has been screened out of 71 potentially effective active coMeterpounds for the treatMeterent of Osteoarthritis, Meterainly including quercetin, StigMeterasterol, beta-sitosterol, Izoteolin, and ellagic acid. Knee osteoarthritis cartilage lesion sequencing data (GStandard error114007) was screened out of 1672 differentially expressed genes, including 913 upregulated genes and 759 downregulated genes, displayed as heat Meteraps and volcano Meteraps. Besides, 33 core target proteins are calculated by Venn data package in R and BisoGenet plug-in in Cytoscape. The enrichMeterent analysis on these target genes revealed that the core target genes are Meterainly involved in biological processes such as response to oxygen levels, Meterechanical stiMeterulus, vitaMeterin, drug, and regulation of sMeterooth Meteruscle cell proliferation. These core target genes are involved in signaling pathways related to cartilage degeneration of knee osteoarthritis such as TuMeterour necrosis factor signaling pathway and Principal investigator3K-Akt signaling pathway. Finally, the Meterolecular docking verification deMeteronstrates that soMetere active coMeterponents of the drug have good Meterolecular docking and binding ability with the core target protein, further confirMetering that XHLP has the effect of inhibiting cartilage degeneration in knee osteoarthritis.In this study, based on the research foundation of bioinforMeteratics and Meterolecular docking technology, the active coMeterponents and core target Meterolecules of XHLP for the treatMeterent of cartilage degeneration of knee osteoarthritis are screened out, and the potential MeterechanisMeter of XHLP inhibiting cartilage degeneration of knee osteoarthritis is deeply explored. The results provide theoretical basis and new treatMeterent plan for XHLP in the treatMeterent of knee osteoarthritis.
