Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis;) is the most common chronic degenerative joint disease and places a subâ€‘ stantial burden on the public health resources in China. The purpose of this study is to preliminarily evaluate whether infrared laser moxibustion (Infrared laser moxibustion;) is non-inferior to traditional moxibustion (Traditional moxibustion;) in the treatment of KOsteoarthritis;. In the designed Zelen-design randomized controlled non-inferiority clinical trial, a total of 74 patients with KOsteoarthritis; will be randomly allocated to one of two interventions: Infrared laser moxibustion; treatment or Traditional moxibustion; treatment. All participants will receive a 6-week treatment and a follow-up 4 weeks after treatment. The primary outcomes will be the mean change in pain scores on the numeric rating scale (Numeric rating scale;) measured at baseline and the end of last treatment at week 6. The secondary outcomes will be the pain scores on the Numeric rating scale; from weeks 1 to 5 after the start of treatment and the changes from baseline to endpoints (weeks 6 and 10) in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis instrument;), 36-Item Short Form Survey Instrument;, knee circumference, and 6-min walking test. In addition, safety assessment will be performed throughout the trial. The results of our study will help determine whether a 6-week treatment with Infrared laser moxibustion; is non-inferior to Traditional moxibustion; in patients with KOsteoarthritis;, therefore providing evidence to verify if Infrared laser moxibustion; can become a safer alternative for Traditional moxibustion; in clinical applications in the future.
