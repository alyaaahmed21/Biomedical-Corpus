Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRole-physical;) has been shown to alleviate the symptoms of patients sufering from knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis;), but for certain patients with hematologic diseases with platelet dysfunction and patients receiving anti-platelet medications, autologous PRole-physical; is not an optimum solution. Allogeneic PRole-physical; has been proven to be safe and efective in the treatment of osteoarthritis, rotator cuf disease, refractory wounds and other medical felds. However, a well-designed and long-term follow-up prospective randomized controlled trial (Randomised controlled trial;) to evaluate the efect of allogeneic PRole-physical; intra-articular injections for KOsteoarthritis; combined with hematologic blood dyscrasias has not yet been performed. We will conduct an allogeneic PRole-physical; injection for KOsteoarthritis; combined with hematologic blood dyscrasias with platelet dysfunction study: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. One hundred participants with KOsteoarthritis; combined with hematologic blood dyscrasias with platelet dysfunction will be randomly allocated to receive either one allogeneic PRole-physical; injection or one saline injection into the knee joint. The primary outcome will be a 12-month change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index) score. Secondary outcomes will be the 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey (Social functioning;-36) score, Lysholm score, overall knee pain score and magnetic resonance imaging; assessment at 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month. The results of this study will help determine whether allogeneic PRole-physical; could be used as a non-surgical intervention to treat patients with knee Osteoarthritis; combined with hematologic blood dyscrasias with platelet dysfunction.
