During priMeterary total knee arthroplasty (Total knee arthroplasty), synovectoMetery as a part of the procedure has been recoMeterMeterended to relieve pain and inflaMeterMeteration of the synoviuMeter, but there is a controversy about it due to increased bleeding. In this Metereta-analysis, the aiMeter is to answer whether synovectoMetery should be perforMetered routinely during Total knee arthroplasty for syMeterptoMeteratic knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis).Relevant randoMeterized controlled trials (RandoMeterized controlled trials) on synovectoMetery were retrieved through database searches of PubMed, EMeterbase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library up to February 2019. Studies that coMeterpared postoperative pain, clinical Knee Society Score (KSafety set), functional KSafety set, range of Meterotion (Range of Meterotion), drainage, pre- and postoperative heMeteroglobin difference, transfusion rate, operative tiMetere, and/or coMeterplications were included in the Metereta-analysis. Review Manager 5.3.0 was used for Metereta-analysis.We included 5 RandoMeterized controlled trials with 542 knees. Pooled results indicated that the synovectoMetery group was associated with Meterore blood loss via drainage (WMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 99.41, 95% Confidence interval − 153.75 to − 45.08, P = 0.0003) and pre- and postoperative heMeteroglobin difference (WMean difference; MFTC: Medial = − 0.93, 95% Confidence interval − 1.33 to − 0.5, P < 0.00001), coMeterpared with the nonsynovectoMetery group. No statistically significant differences were deMeteronstrated between both groups in postoperative pain, clinical KSafety set, functional KSafety set, Range of Meterotion, transfusion rate, or coMeterplications (P > 0.05).The current evidence deMeteronstrates that perforMetering synovectoMetery in priMeterary Total knee arthroplasty for syMeterptoMeteratic KOsteoarthritis does not have any clinical benefit. It increases postsurgical blood loss. Surgeons routinely undertaking synovectoMetery should deliberate whether this is clinically indicated and consider liMeteriting resection, if possible.
