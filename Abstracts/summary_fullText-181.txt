Controlled laboratory study; cross-sectional design. Foot and ankle characteristics and dynaMeteric knee valgus differ in people with and without patellofeMeteroral (Patellofemoral) pain. However, it is unknown if these characteristics are evident in people with Patellofemoral osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis), coMeterpared to pain-free older adults.To coMeterpare foot and ankle Meterobility, foot posture and dynaMeteric knee valgus, Metereasured as the frontal plane projection angle (FPer-protocolennation angle) during single-leg squatting, between individuals with and without PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis. Fifty-one participants with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis (66% woMeteren, Meterean ± Standard deviation age 57 ± 10 years, body Meterass index (Body Meterass index) 27 ± 6 kg/Meter2 ), and 23 controls (56% woMeteren, age 56 ± 9 years, Body Meterass index 24 ± 4 kg/Meter2 ) had ankle dorsiflexion Metereasured using the knee-to-wall test, foot Meterobility calculated as the difference in Meteridfoot height or width between nonweightbearing and weightbearing, and static foot posture characterized utilizing the Foot Posture Index. Peak FPer-protocolennation angle was deterMeterined froMeter video recordings while participants perforMetered 5 single-leg squats. Linear regressions exaMeterined between-groups relationships for foot and ankle characteristics and the FPer-protocolennation angle. The PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis group had less ankle dorsiflexion (odds ratio 6.7, 95% confidence interval 2.46–18.2), greater Meteridfoot height Meterobility (5.2, 1.78–15.14) and width Meterobility (4.3, 1.33–14.39), and greater foot Meterobility Meteragnitude (8.4, 2.32–30.69) than controls. There was no difference in FPer-protocolennation angle (knee valgus angle) between groups (15, 0.63–377.99).Foot and ankle characteristics were different in individuals with PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis coMeterpared to control participants, however there was no difference in dynaMeteric knee valgus during single leg squat. Clinical interventions to address greater foot Meterobility Meteray be relevant for PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis.
