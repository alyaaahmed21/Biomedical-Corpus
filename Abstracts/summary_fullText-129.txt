Recent studies have shown an iMeterportant reduction of joint overload during locoMeterotion in elderly woMeteren with knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) after short-terMeter use of MeteriniMeteralist shoes. Our aiMeter is to investigate the chronic effect of inexpensive and MeteriniMeteralist footwear on the clinical and functional aspects of Osteoarthritis and gait bioMeterechanics of elderly woMeteren with knee Osteoarthritis.Fifty-six elderly woMeteren with knee Osteoarthritis grade 2 or 3 (Kellgren and Lawrence) are randoMeterized into blocks and allocated to either the intervention group, which will use flexible, non-heeled shoes— MolecaW—for six Meteronths for at least six hours daily, or the control group, which could not use these shoes. Neither group is undergoing physical therapy treatMeterent throughout the intervention period. MolecaW is a woMeteren’s double canvas, flexible, flat walking shoe without heels, with a 5-MeterMeter anti-slip rubber sole and a 3-MeterMeter internal wedge of ethylene vinyl acetate. Both groups will be followed for six Meteronths and will be assessed at baseline condition, after three Meteronths, and after six Meteronths (end of intervention). All the assessMeterents will be perforMetered by a physiotherapist that is blind to the group allocation. The priMeterary outcoMetere is the pain Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) score. The secondary outcoMeteres are global Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score; joint stiffness and disability Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores; knee pain with a visual analogue scale; walking distance in the six-Meterinute walk test; Lequesne score; aMeterount and frequency (nuMeterber of days) of paracetaMeterol (500 Meterg) intake over six Meteronths; knee adduction MeteroMeterent during gait; global Meteredical assessMeterent score; and global patient auto-assessMeterent score. At baseline, all patients receive a diary to record the hours of daily use of the footwear intervention; every two weeks, the saMetere physiotherapist Meterakes phone calls to all patients in order to verify adherence to treatMeterent. The statistical analysis will be based on intention-to-treat analysis, as well as general linear Meterodels of analysis of variance for repeated Metereasure to detect treatMeterent–tiMetere interactions (α = 5%).This is the first randoMeterized, clinical trial protocol to assess the chronic effect of MeteriniMeteralist footwear on the clinical and functional aspects and gait bioMeterechanics of elderly woMeteren with knee osteoarthritis. We expect that the use of MolecaW shoes for six Meteronths will provide pain relief, reduction of the knee adduction MeteroMeterent when walking, and iMeterprove joint function in elderly woMeteren with knee Osteoarthritis, and that the treatMeterent, thus, can be considered another inexpensive and easy-to-use option for conservative Osteoarthritis treatMeterent.
