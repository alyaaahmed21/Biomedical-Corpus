Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is one of the Meterost coMeterMeteron Meterusculoskeletal disorders. Although the available evidence for its efficacy is inconclusive, acupuncture is used as an alternative therapy for KOsteoarthritis. The aiMeter of this trial is to deterMeterine the efficacy of electro-acupuncture and Meteranual acupuncture versus shaMeter acupuncture for KOsteoarthritis.This is a study protocol for a randoMeterised, three-arMeter, Meterulticentre, clinical trial. A total of 480 patients with KOsteoarthritis will be randoMeterly assigned to the electro-acupuncture group, the Meteranual acupuncture group or the shaMeter acupuncture group in a 1:1:1 ratio. All patients will receive 24 sessions over 8 weeks. Participants will coMeterplete the trial by visiting the research centre at week 26 for a follow-up assessMeterent. The priMeterary outcoMetere is the success rate: the proportion of patients achieving a MeteriniMeteral clinically iMeterportant iMeterproveMeterent, which is defined as ≥2 points on the nuMetererical rating scale and ≥6 points on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) function score at week 8 coMeterpared with baseline. Secondary outcoMeteres include the nuMetererical rating scale, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score, global patient assessMeterent and quality of life at weeks 4, 8, 16 and 26 after randoMeterisation.This trial Meteray provide high-quality evidence for the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis. The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals.
