In an ever-aging society that as a whole has become more affluent, significant emphasis has been accorded to an improved quality of life. Knee osteoarthritis is ever-increasingly treated with total knee arthroplasty. The benefits and satisfaction experienced by those who have undergone total knee replacements (Total knee replacement(s)) are well documented in the literature. The issue arises when osteoarthritis of the affected knee is more complex than simple osteoarthritis, i.e. the patient has complex primary osteoarthritis. This collective term encompasses conditions such as massive bone loss, ligamentous laxity, coronal defects and those with contractures. There are various classifications to describe massive bone loss but we utilized the Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute (AOdds ratio; Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve;LA: University of California, Los Angeles;I) classification. Numerous treatment options are available and we report the use of metaphyseal sleeves as a highly successful treatment option.We retrospectively reviewed all the patients at our centre who underwent primary Total knee replacement(s) using the metaphyseal sleeves. Patients were assessed on symptoms and functional status, and radiographs were also taken to assess for osseointegration. Only patients who completed 2 years of follow up were included in our study. The updated (2011) Knee Society Score (Knee Society Score;) was used in conjunction with radiological assessments at each follow up. Mean Knee Society Score; scores improved from 53.83 preoperatively to 193.39 postoperatively. All patients demonstrated increasing osseointegration throughout follow up. The metaphyseal sleeve is an excellent treatment option for complex primary osteoarthritic knees with good results objectively, functionally and radiologically and would be a great choice for all orthopaedic surgeons to include in their armamentarium.
