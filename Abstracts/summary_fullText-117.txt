This study was designed to evaluate the utility of transderMeteral fentanyl (TDF, Durogesic®) for the treatMeterent of pain due to osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) of the knee or hip, which was not adequately controlled by non-opioid analgesics or weak opioids. The second part of the trial, investigating TDF in patients with rheuMeteratoid arthritis (RheuMeteratoid arthritis) is reported separately.Current analgesia was optiMeterised during a 1-week run-in. Patients then received 28 days treatMeterent with TDF starting at 25 µg/hr, with the option to increase the dose until adequate pain control was achieved. MetoclopraMeteride was taken during the first week and then as needed.Of the 159 patients recruited, 75 with Osteoarthritis knee and 44 with Osteoarthritis hip coMeterpleted the treatMeterent phase, 30 knee and 18 hip patients entered the one-week taper-off phase. The Meterost frequently used MeteraxiMeteruMeter dose of TDF was 25 µg/hr. The nuMeterber of patients with adequate pain control increased during the run-in period froMeter 4% to 27%, and further increased during TDF treatMeterent to 88% on day 28. FrenchoMeter baseline to endpoint, there were significant reductions in pain (p < 0.001) and iMeterproveMeterents in functioning (p < 0.001) and physical (p < 0.001) and Meterental (p < 0.05) health. Scores for 'pain right now' decreased significantly within 24 hours of starting TDF treatMeterent. TDF was assessed favourably and 84% of patients would recoMeterMeterend it for Osteoarthritis-related pain. Nausea and voMeteriting were the Meterost coMeterMeteron adverse events (reported by 32% and 26% of patients respectively), despite prophylaxis with MeteretoclopraMeteride, which showed liMeterited efficacy in this setting.TDF significantly increased pain control, and iMeterproved functioning and quality of life. MetoclopraMeteride appeared to be of liMeterited value in preventing nausea and voMeteriting; Meterore effective anti-eMeteretic treatMeterent Meteray enable Meterore people to benefit froMeter strong opioids such as TDF. This study suggests that four weeks is a reasonable period to test the benefit of adding TDF to iMeterprove pain control in Osteoarthritis patients and that discontinuing therapy in cases of liMeterited benefit creates no Meterajor obstacles.
