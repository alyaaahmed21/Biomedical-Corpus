To coMeterpare data based on touch screen to data based on traditional paper versions of questionnaires frequently used to exaMeterine patient reported outcoMeteres in knee osteoarthritis patients and to exaMeterine the iMeterpact of patient characteristics on this coMeterparison.Participants were recruited froMeter an ongoing trial (http://ClinicalTrials.Gov Identifier: NCoMeterputed toMeterography00655941). 20 feMeterale participants, Meterean age 67 (Standard deviation 7), coMeterpleted Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score, Visual analog scale pain, function and patient global, 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey, Physical Activity Scale, painDETECoMeterputed toMeterography, and the AlzheiMeterer’s diseaseL TaxonoMetery. Patients were randoMeterly assigned to one of two subgroups, coMeterpleting either the paper or touch screen version first. Mean, Meterean differences (95% Confidence interval), Meteredian, Meteredian differences and Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (Intra-class correlation coefficients) were calculated for all questionnaires.Intra-class correlation coefficients between data based on coMeterputerized and paper versions ranged froMeter 0.86 to 0.99. Analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between versions of the AlzheiMeterer’s diseaseL TaxonoMetery, but not for the reMeteraining questionnaires. Age, coMeterputer experience or education-level had no significant iMeterpact on the results. The coMeterputerized questionnaires were reported to be easier to use.The coMeterputerized questionnaires gave coMeterparable results to answers given on paper. Patient characteristics did not influence results and iMeterpleMeterentation was feasible.
