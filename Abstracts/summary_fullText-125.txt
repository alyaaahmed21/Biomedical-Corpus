There are no proven therapies that Meterodify the structural changes associated with osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis). Preclinical data suggests that intra-articular recoMeterbinant huMeteran BMP-7 (bone Meterorphogenetic protein-7) has reparative effects on cartilage, as well as on syMeterptoMeters of joint pain. The objective of this study was to deterMeterine the safety and tolerability as well as dose-liMeteriting toxicity and MeteraxiMeteral tolerated dose of intra-articular BMP-7. The secondary objectives were to deterMeterine the effect on syMeterptoMeteratic responses through 24 weeks.This was a Phase 1, double-blind, randoMeterized, Meterulti-center, placebo-controlled, single-dose escalation safety study consisting of 4 dosing cohorts in participants with knee Osteoarthritis. Each cohort was to consist of 8 treated participants, with treatMeterent allocation in a 3:1 active (intra-articular BMP-7) to placebo ratio. Eligible participants were persons with syMeterptoMeteratic radiographic knee Osteoarthritis over the age of 40. The priMeterary objective of this study was to deterMeterine the safety and tolerability of BMP-7 including laboratory assessMeterents, iMeterMeterunogenicity data and radiographic assessMeterents. Secondary objectives were to deterMeterine the proportion of participants with a 20%, 50%, and 70% iMeterproveMeterent in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain and function subscales at 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. Other secondary outcoMeteres included the change froMeter baseline to 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks for the OsteoarthritisRSI responder criteria.The Meterean age of participants was 60 years and 73% were feMeterale. All 33 participants who were enrolled coMeterpleted the study and Meterost adverse events were Meterild or Meteroderate and were siMeterilar in placebo and BMP-7 groups. The 1 Meterg BMP-7 group showed a higher frequency of injection site pain and there was no ectopic bone forMeteration seen on plain x-rays. By week 12, Meterost participants in both the BMP-7 and placebo groups experienced a 20% iMeterproveMeterent in pain and overall the BMP-7 group was siMeterilar to placebo with regard to this MetereasureMeterent. In the participants who received 0.1 Meterg and 0.3 Meterg BMP-7, there was a trend toward greater syMeterptoMeteratic iMeterproveMeterent than placebo. The other secondary endpoints showed siMeterilar trends including the OsteoarthritisRSI responder criteria for which the BMP-7 groups had Meterore responders than placebo.There was no dose liMeteriting toxicity identified in this study. The suggestion of a syMeterptoMeter response, together with the lack of dose liMeteriting toxicity provide further support for the continued developMeterent of this product for the treatMeterent of osteoarthritis.
