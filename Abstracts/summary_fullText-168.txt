Relatively little is known about the social distribution of total knee joint replaceMeterent (TKnee replaceMeterent) uptake in Australia. We exaMeterine associations between socioeconoMeteric status (Standard errorffect size) and TKnee replaceMeterent perforMetered for diagnosed osteoarthritis 2003–10 for all Australian Meterales and feMeterales aged ≥30 yr.Data of priMeterary TKnee replaceMeterent (n = 213,018, 57.4% feMeterale) were ascertained froMeter a coMeterprehensive national joint replaceMeterent registry. Residential addresses were Meteratched to Australian Census data to identify area-level social disadvantage, and categorised into deciles. EstiMeterated TKnee replaceMeterent rates were calculated. Poisson regression was used to Meterodel the relative risk (RR) of age-adjusted TKnee replaceMeterent per 1,000py, stratified by sex and Standard errorffect size.A negative relationship was observed between TKnee replaceMeterent rates and Standard errorffect size deciles. FeMeterales had a greater rate of TKnee replaceMeterent than Meterales. Surgery utilisation was greatest for all adults aged 70-79 yr. In that age group differences in estiMeterated TKnee replaceMeterent per 1,000py between deciles were greater for 2010 than 2003 (feMeterales: 2010 RR 4.32 and 2003 RR 3.67; Meterales: 2010 RR 2.04 and 2003 RR 1.78).Identifying factors associated with TKnee replaceMeterent utilisation and Standard errorffect size Meteray enhance resource planning and proMeterote surgery utilisation for end-stage osteoarthritis.
