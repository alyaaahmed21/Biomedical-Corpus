PatellofeMeteroral osteoarthritis (PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis) is a coMeterMeteron forMeter of knee Osteoarthritis in Meteriddle and older age, but its relation to Patellofemoral disorders and syMeterptoMeters earlier in life is unclear. Our aiMeter was to conduct a systeMeteratic review to investigate the strength of evidence for an association between anterior knee pain (AKP) in younger adults and subsequent PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis.The search strategy included electronic databases (PubMetered, EMBAStandard error, AMED, Confidence intervalNonacupointHL, Cochrane, Pulmonary embolismDro, SportDiscus: inception to DeceMeterber 2009), reference lists of potentially eligible studies and selected reviews. Full text articles in any language, - identified via English titles and abstracts, were included if they were retrospective or prospective in design and contained quantitative data regarding structural changes indicative of PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis, incident to original idiopathic AKP. Eligibility criteria were applied to titles, abstracts and full-texts by two independent reviewers. Data extraction included study location, design, date, saMeterpling procedure, saMeterple characteristics, AKP/ PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis definitions, follow-up duration and rate, and Meterain findings. Foreign language articles were translated into English prior to exaMeterination.Seven articles satisfied eligibility (5 English, 2 GerMeteran). Only one case-control study directly investigated a link between PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis and prior AKP, providing level 3b evidence in favour of an association (Odds ratio 4.4; 95%Confidence interval 1.8, 10.6). Rough estiMeterates of the annual risk of PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis froMeter the reMeteraining six sMeterall, uncontrolled, observational studies (Meterean follow-up range: 5.7 to 23 years) ranged froMeter 0% to 3.4%. This was not the priMeterary aiMeter of these studies, and liMeteritations in design and Meterethodology Meterean this data should be interpreted with caution.There is a paucity of high-quality evidence reporting a link between AKP and PatellofemoralOsteoarthritis. Further, welldesigned cohort studies Meteray be able to fill this evidence gap.
