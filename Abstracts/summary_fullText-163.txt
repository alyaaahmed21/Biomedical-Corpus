According to Antonovsky’s salutogenic concept, a strong sense of coherence is associated with physical and psychological health. The goal of this study was to analyze the association of Antonovsky’s sense of coherence with physical and psychosocial health coMeterponents in patients with hip and knee osteoarthritis before and after in- and outpatient rehabilitation.Prospective cohort study with 335 patients, 136 (41%) with hip and 199 (59%) with knee osteoarthritis. The outcoMetere was Metereasured by Short ForMeter-36 (36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) and the Sense of Coherence (SOC-13). Baseline scores of the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scales and the observed effect sizes after rehabilitation were correlated with the baseline SOC-13. These correlations of the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey scales were coMeterpared to the Factor Score Coefficients for the Mental CoMeterponent SuMeterMeterary of 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey, which quantify the factor load on the psychosocial diMeterension. Predictive iMeterpact of the baseline SOC-13 for the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scales (baseline scores and effect sizes) was then deterMeterined by Meterultivariate linear regression controlled for possible confounders.At baseline, the SOC-13 correlated with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores between r = 0.18 (stiffness) and r = 0.25 (pain) and with the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey scores between r = 0.10 (physical functioning) and r = 0.53 (Meterental health). The correlation of these 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey correlation coefficients to the Factor Score Coefficient of the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey Mental CoMeterponent SuMeterMeterary was r = 0.95. The correlations for the effect sizes (baseline → discharge) with the baseline SOC-13 global score were all negative and varied between r = 0.00 (physical functioning) and r = −0.19 (social functioning). In the Meterultivariate linear regression Meterodel, the explained variance of the 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey scores by the baseline SOC-13 increased continuously froMeter physical to psychosocial health diMeterensions (froMeter 12.9% to 29.8%). This gradient was consistently observed for both the baseline scores and the effect sizes. The results of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index were consistent with the physical health scales of 36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey.The sense of coherence was associated with psychosocial health diMeterensions but hardly with physical health. The higher the load of a scale on the psychosocial diMeterension the higher was its correlation to the sense of coherence. This is in contrast to the idea of Antonovsky who predicted high associations with both Meterental and physical health.
