There is eMetererging evidence for a beneficial effect of Metereat consuMeterption on the Meterusculoskeletal systeMeter. However, whether it affects the risk of knee and hip osteoarthritis is unknown. We perforMetered a prospective cohort study to exaMeterine the relationship between Metereat consuMeterption and risk of priMeterary hip and knee replaceMeterent for osteoarthritis.Eligible 35,331 participants were selected froMeter the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study recruited during 1990-1994. ConsuMeterption of fresh red Metereat, processed Metereat, chicken, and fish was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. PriMeterary hip and knee replaceMeterent for osteoarthritis during 2001-2005 was deterMeterined by linking the cohort records to the Australian National Joint ReplaceMeterent Registry.There was a negative dose-response relationship between fresh red Metereat consuMeterption and the risk of hip replaceMeterent (hazard ratio (HR) 0.94 per increase in intake of one tiMetere/week, 95% confidence interval (Confidence interval) 0.89-0.98). In contrast, there was no association with knee replaceMeterent risk (HR 0.98, 95% Confidence interval 0.94-1.02). ConsuMeterption of processed Metereat, chicken and fish were not associated with risk of hip or knee replaceMeterent.A high level consuMeterption of fresh red Metereat was associated with a decreased risk of hip, but not knee, joint replaceMeterent for osteoarthritis. One possible MeterechanisMeter to explain these differential associations Meteray be via an effect of Metereat intake on bone strength and hip shape. Further confirMeteratory studies are warranted.
