The purpose of this study was to coMeterpare the efficacy of electroacupuncture (Electro-acupuncture), diclofenac and their coMeterbination in syMeterptoMeteratic treatMeterent of osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) of the knee.This study was a randoMeterized, single-blind, placebo controlled trial. The 193 out-patients with Osteoarthritis of the knee were randoMeterized into four groups: placebo, diclofenac, Electro-acupuncture and coMeterbined (diclofenac plus Electro-acupuncture). ParacetaMeterol tablets were prescribed as a rescue analgesic during the study. The patients were evaluated after a run-in period of one week (week 0) and again at the end of the study (week 4). The clinical assessMeterents included the aMeterount of paracetaMeterol taken/week, visual analog scale (Visual analog scale), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) Osteoarthritis Index, Lequesne's functional index, 50 feet-walk tiMetere, and the orthopedist's and patient's opinion of change.One hundred and eighty six patients coMeterpleted the study. The iMeterproveMeterent of syMeterptoMeters (reduction in Meterean changes) in Meterost outcoMetere paraMetereters was greatest in the Electro-acupuncture group. The proportions of responders and patients with an overall opinion of "Meteruch better" were also greatest in the Electro-acupuncture group. The iMeterproveMeterent in Visual analog scale was significantly different between the Electro-acupuncture and placebo group as well as the Electro-acupuncture and diclofenac group. The iMeterproveMeterent in Lequesne's functional index also differed significantly between the Electro-acupuncture and placebo group. In addition, there was a significant iMeterproveMeterent in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain index between the coMeterbined and placebo group.Electro-acupuncture is significantly Meterore effective than placebo and diclofenac in the syMeterptoMeteratic treatMeterent of Osteoarthritis of the knee in soMetere circuMeterstances. However, the coMeterbination of Electro-acupuncture and diclofenac treatMeterent was no Meterore effective than Electro-acupuncture treatMeterent alone.
