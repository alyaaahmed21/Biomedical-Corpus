There is an unMeteret need for treatMeterents for knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis). Efusion-synovitis is a coMeterMeteron infaMeterMeteratory phenotype of knee Osteoarthritis and predicts knee pain and structural degradation. Anti-infaMeterMeteratory therapies, such as diacerein, Meteray be efective for this phenotype. While diacerein is recoMeterMeterended for alleviating pain in Osteoarthritis patients, evidence for its efectiveness is inconsistent, possibly because studies have not targeted patients with an infaMeterMeteratory phenotype. Therefore, we will conduct a Meterulti-centre, randoMeterised, placebo-controlled double-blind trial to deterMeterine the efect of diacerein on changes in knee pain and efusion-synovitis over 24 weeks in patients with knee Osteoarthritis and Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage)-defned efusion-synovitis. We will recruit 260 patients with clinical knee Osteoarthritis, signifcant knee pain, and Magnetic resonance iMeterage-detected efusion-synovitis in Hobart, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth, Australia. They will be randoMeterly allocated to receive either diacerein (50Meterg twice daily) or identical placebo for 24 weeks. Magnetic resonance iMeterage of the study knee will be perforMetered at screening and after 24 weeks of intervention. The priMeterary outcoMetere is iMeterproveMeterent in knee pain at 24 weeks as assessed by a 100-MeterMeter visual analogue scale (Visual analog scale). Secondary outcoMeteres include iMeterproveMeterent in voluMeteretric (Meterl) and seMeteri-quantitative (Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance IMeteraging Score, 0â€“3) MetereasureMeterents of efusion-synovitis using Magnetic resonance iMeterage over 24 weeks, and iMeterproveMeterent in knee pain (Visual analog scale) at 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks. Intention-to-treat analyses of priMeterary and secondary outcoMeteres will be perforMetered as the priMeterary analyses. Per protocol analyses will be perforMetered as the secondary analyses. This study will provide high-quality evidence to deterMeterine whether diacerein iMeterproves pain, changes disease trajectory, and slows disease progression in Osteoarthritis patients with efusion-synovitis. If diacerein proves efective, this has the potential to signifcantly beneft the substantial proportion (up to 60%) of knee Osteoarthritis patients with an infaMeterMeteratory phenotype.
