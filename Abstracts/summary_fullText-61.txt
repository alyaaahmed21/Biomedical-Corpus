This systematic review gives an overview of guidelines and original publications as well as the evidence on which the currently proposed indication criteria are based. Until now such a state-of-the-science overview was lacking. Websites of orthopaedic and arthritis organizations (English/Dutch language) were independently searched by two authors for THyaluronic acid;/Total knee arthroplasty; guidelines for Osteoarthritis;. Furthermore, a systematic search strategy in several databases through August 2014 was performed. Quartiles;uality of the guidelines was assessed with the AGRole-emotion;E II instrument, which consists of 6 domains (maximum summed score of 6 indicating high quality). Also, the level of evidence of all included studies was assessed.We found 6 guidelines and 18 papers, out of 3065 references. The quality of the guidelines summed across 6 domains ranged from 0.46 to 4.78. In total, 12 THyaluronic acid;, 10 Total knee arthroplasty; and 2 THyaluronic acid;/Total knee arthroplasty; indication sets were found. Four studies stated that no evidence-based indication criteria are available. Indication criteria concerning THyaluronic acid;/Total knee arthroplasty; consisted of the following domains: pain (in respectively 11 and 10 sets), function (12 and 7 sets), radiological changes (10 and 9 sets), failed conservative therapy (8 and 4 sets) and other indications (6 and 7 sets). Specific cut-off values or ranges were often not stated and the level of evidence was low.The indication criteria for THyaluronic acid;/Total knee arthroplasty; are based on limited evidence. Empirical research is needed, especially regarding domain specific cut-off values or ranges at which the best postoperative outcomes are achieved for patients, taking into account the limited lifespan of a prosthesis.
