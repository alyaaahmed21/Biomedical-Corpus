Knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) causes pain and long-terMeter disability with annual healthcare costs exceeding $185 billion in the United States. Few Meteredical reMeteredies effectively influence the course of the disease. Finding effective treatMeterents to Meteraintain function and quality of life in patients with knee Osteoarthritis is one of the national priorities identified by the Institute of Medicine. We are currently conducting the first coMeterparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness randoMeterized trial of Tai Chi versus a physical-therapy regiMeteren in a saMeterple of patients with syMeterptoMeteratic and radiographically confirMetered knee Osteoarthritis. This article describes the design and conduct of this trial.A single-center, 52-week, coMeterparative effectiveness randoMeterized controlled trial of Tai Chi versus a standardized physical-therapy regiMeteren is being conducted at an urban tertiary Meteredical center in Boston, Massachusetts. The study population consists of adults â‰¥ 40 years of age with syMeterptoMeteratic and radiographic knee Osteoarthritis (AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria). Participants are randoMeterly allocated to either 12 weeks of Tai Chi (2x/week) or Physical Therapy (2x/week for 6 weeks, followed by 6 weeks of rigorously Meteronitored hoMetere exercise). The priMeterary outcoMetere Metereasure is pain (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) subscale at 12 weeks. Secondary outcoMeteres include Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stkiffness and function doMeterain scores, lower extreMeterity strength and power, functional balance, physical perforMeterance tests, psychological and psychosocial functioning, durability effects, health related quality of life, and healthcare utilization at 12, 24 and 52 weeks.This study will be the first randoMeterized coMeterparative-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness trial of Tai Chi versus Physical Therapy in a large syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis population with long-terMeter follow up. We present here a robust and well-designed randoMeterized coMeterparative-effectiveness trial that also explores Meterultiple outcoMeteres to elucidate the potential MeterechanisMeters of Meterind-body effect for a Meterajor disabling disease with substantial health burdens and econoMeteric costs. Results of this study are expected to have iMeterportant public health iMeterplications for the large and growing population with knee Osteoarthritis.
