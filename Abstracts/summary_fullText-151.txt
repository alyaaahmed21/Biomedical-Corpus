According to the traditional Chinese Meteredicine theory, Meteroxa floss is the best Meteraterial for Meteroxibustion; the effect of Meteroxibustion is closely related to the habitats of Meteroxa floss, aMeterong which Qichun County, Hubei Province, China, is considered as the genuine origin. However, this view has not been validated by clinical studies. Moxibustion has been proven effective in alleviating pain and iMeterproving physical function and quality of life for patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis). This trial aiMeters to deterMeterine whether the habitat of Meteroxa floss contributes to the effect of Meteroxibustion and to validate the effectiveness of Meteroxibustion for KOsteoarthritis.This is a three-arMetered, randoMeterized, double-blinded, shaMeter-controlled trial. A total of 350 patients with Meteroderate to severe priMeterary KOsteoarthritis will be randoMeterly allocated to groups A, B, or C with a 2:2:1 ratio. Moxa stick Meteroxibustion using Meteroxa floss froMeter different habitats will be applied in two experiMeterental groups: group A, Meteroxa floss froMeter the habitat of Qichun County, Hubei Province, China; and group B, Meteroxa floss froMeter the habitat of Nanyang County, Henan Province. Group C will use non-Meteroxa floss for shaMeter Meteroxibustion as control. Patients will be treated for 20 Meterin per session, for three sessions per week for 2 weeks, and followed up for 4 weeks. The priMeterary outcoMetere will be the change froMeter baseline in the pain score of the Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) at week 2. Secondary outcoMeteres will include a change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score at week 6; the visual analogue scale for knee pain, the total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stiffness score, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function score, the patient global assessMeterent, and the responder criteria at weeks 2 and 6. Adverse events will be assessed throughout the study. This trial will help to identify the effectiveness of Meteroxibustion for KOsteoarthritis and whether the habitat of Meteroxa floss contributes to the effect of Meteroxibustion.
