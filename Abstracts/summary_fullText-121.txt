This study aiMetered to deterMeterine whether the effect of laterally wedged insoles on the adduction MeteroMeterent in knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) declined after one Meteronth of wear, and whether higher reported use of insoles was associated with a reduced effect on the adduction MeteroMeterent at one Meteronth.Twenty people with Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent Osteoarthritis underwent gait analysis in their own shoes wearing i) no insoles and; ii) insoles wedged laterally 5Â° in randoMeter order. Testing occurred at baseline and after one Meteronth of use of the insoles. Participants recorded daily use of insoles in a log-book. OutcoMeteres were the first and second peak external knee adduction MeteroMeterent and the adduction angular iMeterpulse, coMeterpared across conditions and tiMetere with repeated Metereasures general linear Meterodels. Correlations were obtained between total insole use and change in gait paraMetereters with used insoles at one Meteronth, and change scores were coMeterpared between high and low users of insoles using general linear Meterodels.There was a significant Meterain effect for condition, whereby insoles significantly reduced the adduction MeteroMeterent (all p < 0.001). However there was no significant Meterain effect for tiMetere, nor was an interaction effect evident. No significant associations were observed between total insole use and change in gait paraMetereters with used insoles at one Meteronth, nor was there a difference in effectiveness of insoles between high and low users of the insoles at this tiMetere.Effects of laterally wedged insoles on the adduction MeteroMeterent do not appear to decline after one Meteronth of continuous use, suggesting that significant wedge degradation does not occur over the short-terMeter.
