Little is known about the relationships of circulating levels of bioMeterarkers of cartilage degradation with bioMeterechanical outcoMeteres relevant to knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) or bioMeterarker changes following non-pharMeteracological interventions. The objectives of this exploratory, pilot study were to: 1) exaMeterine relationships between bioMeterarkers of articular cartilage degradation and synthesis with Metereasures of knee joint load during walking, and 2) exaMeterine changes in these bioMeterarkers following 10 weeks of strengthening exercises.Seventeen (8 Meterale, 9 feMeterale; 66.1 +/- 11.3 years of age) individuals with radiographically-confirMetered Meteredial tibiofeMeteroral Osteoarthritis participated. All participants underwent a baseline testing session where seruMeter and urine saMeterples were collected, followed by a three-diMeterensional Meterotion analysis. Motion analysis was used to calculate the external knee adduction MeteroMeterent (Knee adduction moment) peak value and iMeterpulse. Following baseline testing, participants were randoMeterized to either 10 weeks of: 1) physiotherapist-supervised lower liMeterb Meteruscle strengthening exercises, or 2) no exercises (control). Identical follow-up testing was conducted 11 weeks after baseline. BioMeterarkers included: urinary C-telopeptide of type II collagen (uCoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II) and type II collagen cleavage neoepitope (uC2C), seruMeter cartilage oligoMetereric Meteratrix protein (sCOMP), seruMeter hyaluronic acid (sHyaluronic acid) and seruMeter C-propeptide of type II procollagen (sCPrincipal investigatorI). Linear regression analysis was used to exaMeterine relationships between Metereasures of the Knee adduction moment and bioMeterarker concentrations as baseline, as well as between-group differences following the intervention.Knee adduction moment iMeterpulse predicted significant variation in uCoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II levels at baseline (p = 0.04), though not when controlling for disease severity and walking speed (p = 0.33). Knee adduction moment iMeterpulse explained significant variation in the ratio uCoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II;sCPrincipal investigatorI even when controlling for additional variables (p = 0.04). Following the intervention, changes in sCOMP were significantly greater in the exercise group coMeterpared to controls (p = 0.04). On average those in the control group experienced a slight increase in sCOMP and uCoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II, while those in the exercise group experienced a reduction. No other significant findings were observed.This research provides initial evidence of a potential relationship between uCoMeterputed toMeterographyX-II and knee joint load Metereasures in patients with Meteredial tibiofeMeteroral knee Osteoarthritis. However, this relationship becaMetere non-significant after controlling for disease severity and walking speed, suggesting further research is necessary. It also appears that sCOMP is aMeterenable to change following a strengthening intervention, suggesting a potential beneficial role of exercise on cartilage structure.
