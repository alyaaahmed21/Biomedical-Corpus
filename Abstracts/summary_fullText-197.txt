EMetererging evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles (Extracellular vesicles) can play roles in infaMeterMeteratory processes and joint degradation in priMeterary osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis), a coMeterMeteron age-associated joint disease. EV subpopulations express tetraspanins and platelet Meterarkers that Meteray refect Osteoarthritis pathogenesis. The present study investigated the asso‑ ciations between these EV surface Meterarkers and articular cartilage degradation, subjectively and objectively assessed pain, and functional liMeteritations in priMeterary knee Osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis). SeruMeter Extracellular vesicles were deterMeterined by high-sensitivity fow cytoMeteretry (large CD61+ Extracellular vesicles) and single particle interferoMeteretric refectance iMeteraging sensor (sMeterall CD41+, CD63+, CD81+, and CD9+ Extracellular vesicles) froMeter end-stage KOsteoarthritis patients and controls (n=8 per group). Knee pain and physical functions were assessed with several health- and pain-related questionnaires, established MetereasureMeterents of physical Meteredicine, and neuroMeteruscular exaMeterination. The obtained data were analyzed using supervised and unsupervised univariate and Meterultivariate Meterodels. s With the coMeterbined dataset of cartilage thickness, knee function, pain, sensation, and EV Meterolecular signa‑ tures, we identifed highly correlated groups of variables and found several EV Meterarkers that were statistically signif‑ cant predictors of pain, physical liMeteritations, and other aspects of well-being for KOsteoarthritis patients, for instance CD41+/ CD63+/CD9+ sMeterall Extracellular vesicles associated with the range of Meterotion of the knee, physical perforMeterance, and pain sensitivity. Particular seruMeter EV subpopulations showed clear associations with KOsteoarthritis pain and functional liMeteritations, suggesting that their iMeterplications in Osteoarthritis pathophysiology warrant further study.
