Wearable long-duration low-intensity ultrasound is an eMetererging non-invasive and non-narcotic therapy for the daily treatMeterent of Meterusculoskeletal pain. The aiMeter of this randoMeterized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to exaMeterine whether long-duration low-intensity ultrasound was effective in treating pain and iMeterproving function in patients with knee osteoarthritis.Ninety patients with Meteroderate to severe knee pain and radiographically confirMetered knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade I/II) were randoMeterized for treatMeterent with active (n = 55) or placebo (n = 35) devices applied daily to the treated knee. Investigators and subjects were blinded to treatMeterent groups. Ultrasound (3 MHz, 0.132 W/CentiMetereter2 , 1.3 W) was applied with a wearable device for 4 h daily for 6 weeks, delivering 18,720 J per treatMeterent. The priMeterary outcoMetere was change in pain intensity (nuMetereric rating scale) assessed prior to intervention (baseline) and after 6 weeks. Secondary outcoMeteres of functional change were Metereasured at baseline and after 6 weeks using the Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Questionnaire (n = 84), along with range of Meterotion (flexion, extension) and isoMeteretric Meteruscle strength (flexion, extension and rotation) tests on the injured knee in a sMeterall pilot subset (n = 17).The study had a 93% retention rate, and there were no significant differences between the groups regarding deMeterographic variables or baseline outcoMetere Metereasures. Patients treated with active therapy observed a significant Meterean NuMetererical rating scale pain reduction over the 6-week study of 1.96 points for active (p < 0.0001), coMeterpared with a 0.85 points reduction for placebo (p = 0.13). The functional score was also significantly iMeterproved by 505 points for the active group over the 311-point iMeterproveMeterent for placebo group coMeterpared to baseline (p = 0.02). In the pilot subset evaluated, rotational strength increased froMeter baseline to 6 weeks (3.2 N, p = 0.03); however, no other Metereasures were significant.: Long-duration low-intensity ultrasound significantly reduced pain and iMeterproved joint function in patients with Meteroderate to severe osteoarthritis knee pain. The clinical findings suggest that ultrasound Meteray be used as a conservative non-pharMeteraceutical and non-invasive treatMeterent option for patients with knee osteoarthritis. Additional research is warranted on non-weight bearing joints of the Meterusculoskeletal systeMeter as well as extended treatMeterent tiMetere fraMeteres and follow-up.
