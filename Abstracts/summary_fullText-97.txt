To develop and assess the performance of machine learning (Machine learning;) models based on magnetic resonance imaging (Magnetic resonance imaging;) radiomics analysis for knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis;) diagnosis. This retrospective study analysed 148 consecutive patients (72 with KOsteoarthritis; and 76 without) with available Magnetic resonance imaging; image data, where radiomics features in cartilage portions were extracted and then fltered. Intraclass correlation coefcient (Interclass correlation coefcient;) was calculated to quantify the reproducibility of features, and a threshold of 0.8 was set. The training and validation cohorts consisted of 117 and 31 cases, respectively. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator;) regression method was employed for feature selection. The Machine learning; classifers were logistic regression (Logistic regression;), K-nearest neighbour (K-nearest neighbour;) and support vector machine (Support vector machine;). In each algorithm, ten models derived from all available planes of three joint compartments and their various combinations were, respectively, constructed for comparative analysis. The performance of classifers was mainly evaluated and compared by receiver operating characteristic (Receiver operating characteristic;) analysis. All models achieved satisfying performances, especially the Final model, where accuracy and area under Receiver operating characteristic; curve (Area under curve;) of Logistic regression; classifer were 0.968, 0.983 (0.957–1.000, 95% Confidence interval;) in the validation cohort, and 0.940, 0.984 (0.969– 0.995, 95% Confidence interval;) in the training cohort, respectively. The Magnetic resonance imaging; radiomics analysis represented promising performance in noninvasive and preoperative KOsteoarthritis; diagnosis, especially when considering all available planes of all three compartments of knee joints.
