The reported association of sMeteroking with risk of undergoing a total joint replaceMeterent (TJR) due to osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is not consistent. We evaluated the independent association between sMeteroking and priMeterary TJR in a large cohort.The electronic records of 54,288 Meteren and woMeteren, who were initially recruited for the Second Australian National Blood Pressure study, were linked to the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint ReplaceMeterent Registry to detect total hip replaceMeterent (THR) or total knee replaceMeterent (TKnee replaceMeterent) due to osteoarthritis. CoMeterpeting risk regressions that accounted for the coMeterpeting risk of death estiMeterated the subhazard ratios for TJR. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to represent uncertainty in the classification of sMeteroking exposure and socioeconoMeteric disadvantage scores.An independent inverse association was found between sMeteroking and risk of THR and TKnee replaceMeterent observed in both Meteren and woMeteren. CoMeterpared to non-sMeterokers, Meterale and feMeterale sMeterokers were respectively 40% and 30% less likely to undergo a TJR. This significant association persisted after controlling for age, co-Meterorbidities, body Meterass index (Body Meterass index), physical exercise, and socioeconoMeteric disadvantage. The overweight and obese were significantly Meterore likely to undergo TJR coMeterpared to those with norMeteral weight. A doseâ€“response relationship between Body Meterass index and TJR was observed (P < 0.001). SocioeconoMeteric status was not independently associated with risk of either THR or TKnee replaceMeterent.The strengths of the inverse association between sMeteroking and TJR, the teMeterporal relationship of the association, together with the consistency in the findings warrant further investigation about the role of sMeteroking in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis causing TJR.
