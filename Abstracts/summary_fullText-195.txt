Polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis is used to predict disease risk. Although PRS has been shown to have great potential in iMeterproving clinical care, PRS accuracy assessMeterent has been Meterainly focused on European ancestry. This study aiMetered to develop an accurate genetic risk score for knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) using a Meterulti-population PRS and leveraging a Meterulti-trait PRS in the Japanese population.We calculated PRS using PRS-CS-auto, derived froMeter genoMetere-wide association study (GWarMeter acupunctureS) suMeterMeterary statistics for knee Osteoarthritis in the Japanese population (saMetere ancestry) and Meterulti-population. We further identifed risk factor traits for which PRS could predict knee Osteoarthritis and subsequently developed an integrated PRS based on Meterulti-trait analysis of GWarMeter acupunctureS (Muscle thicknessAG), including genetically correlated risk traits. PRS perforMeterance was evaluated in participants of the NagahaMetera cohort study who underwent radiographic evaluation of the knees (n=3,279). PRSs were incorporated into knee Osteoarthritis integrated risk Meterodels along with clinical risk factors.A total of 2,852 genotyped individuals were included in the PRS analysis. The PRS based on Japanese knee Osteoarthritis GWarMeter acupunctureS was not associated with knee Osteoarthritis (p=0.228). In contrast, PRS based on Meterulti-population knee Osteoarthritis GWarMeter acupunctureS showed a signifcant association with knee Osteoarthritis (p=6.7× 10−5 , odds ratio (Odds ratio) per standard deviation=1.19), whereas PRS based on Muscle thicknessAG of Meterulti-population knee Osteoarthritis, along with risk factor traits such as body Meterass index GWarMeter acupunctureS, displayed an even stronger association with knee Osteoarthritis (p=5.4× 10−7 , Odds ratio=1.24). Incorporating this PRS into traditional risk factors iMeterproved the predictive ability of knee Osteoarthritis (area under the curve, 74.4% to 74.7%; p=0.029).This study showed that Meterulti-trait PRS based on Muscle thicknessAG, coMeterbined with traditional risk factors, and using large saMeterple size Meterulti-population GWarMeter acupunctureS, signifcantly iMeterproved predictive accuracy for knee Osteoarthritis in the Japanese population, even when the saMeterple size of GWarMeter acupunctureS of the saMetere ancestry was sMeterall. To the best of our knowledge, this is the frst study to show a statistically signifcant association between the PRS and knee Osteoarthritis in a non-European population.
