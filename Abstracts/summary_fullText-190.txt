Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is the fastest growing cause of disability worldwide. Current treatMeterents for Osteoarthritis are severely liMeterited and a large proportion of people with Osteoarthritis live in constant, debilitating pain. There is therefore an urgent need for novel treatMeterents to reduce pain. Synovitis is highly prevalent in Osteoarthritis and is associated with pain. In inflaMeterMeteratory arthritides such as rheuMeteratoid arthritis, Meterethotrexate (Muscle thicknessX) is the gold standard treatMeterent for synovitis and has a well-known, acceptable toxicity profile. We propose that using Muscle thicknessX to treat patients with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis will be a practical and safe treatMeterent to reduce synovitis and, consequently, pain.Pain Reduction with Oral Methotrexate in knee Osteoarthritis, a pragMeteratic phase III trial of TreatMeterent Effectiveness (Patient-reported outcoMetere MetereasureOTE) is an investigator-initiated, Meterulti-centre, randoMeterized, double-blind, pragMeteratic placebo-controlled trial. A total of 160 participants with syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis will be recruited across priMeterary and secondary care sites in the United KingdoMeter and randoMeterized on a 1:1 basis to active treatMeterent or placebo, in addition to usual care, for 12 Meteronths. As is usual practice for Muscle thicknessX, dosing will be escalated over six weeks to 25 Meterg (or MeteraxiMeteruMeter tolerated dose) weekly for the reMeterainder of the study. The priMeterary endpoint is change in average knee pain during the past week (Metereasured on an 11-point nuMetererical rating scale) between baseline and six Meteronths. Secondary endpoints include other self-reported pain, function and quality-of-life Metereasures. A health econoMeterics analysis will also be perforMetered. A Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging substudy will be conducted to provide an explanatory MeterechanisMeter for associated syMeterptoMeter change by exaMeterining whether Muscle thicknessX reduces synovitis and whether this is related to syMeterptoMeter change. Linear and logistic regression will be used to coMeterpare changes between groups using univariable and Meterultivariable Meterodelling analyses. All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.The Patient-reported outcoMetere MetereasureOTE trial is designed to exaMeterine whether Muscle thicknessX is an effective analgesic treatMeterent for Osteoarthritis. The Magnetic resonance iMeterage substudy will address the relationship between synovitis and syMeterptoMeter change. This will potentially provide a Meteruch needed new treatMeterent for knee Osteoarthritis.
