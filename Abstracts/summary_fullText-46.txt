Previous studies have been inconsistent concerning the association between smoking and risk of osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis;). This study aimed to explore the associations of smoking status and change in cartilage volume of Osteoarthritis; in two longitudinal cohorts.Subjects from the Osteoarthritis Initiative cohort (Osteoarthritis;I, n=593) and the Tasmanian Older Adult Cohort (TASOsteoarthritis;C, n=394) were included in this study. For both cohorts, participants were classified into three groups based on their smoking status, namely ‘never’, ‘former’, and ‘current’ smokers. The outcome measures were the annual rate of change of tibiofemoral cartilage volume over 2 years in Osteoarthritis;I and of tibial cartilage volume over 2.6 years in TASOsteoarthritis;C. Potential confounders were balanced using the inverse probability of treatment weighting (inverse probability of treatment weighting;) method. Overall, 42.3% and 37.4% of participants were former smokers, and 5.7% and 9.3% were current smokers in the Osteoarthritis;I and TASOsteoarthritis;C cohorts, respectively. Compared to never smokers, neither former nor current smoking was associated with risk of the annual rate of change of tibiofemoral cartilage volume in Osteoarthritis;I (former smoker: β=-0.068%/ year, 95% confidence interval  -0.824 to 0.688, p=0.860; current smoker: β=-0.222%/year, 95% Confidence interval; -0.565 to 0.120, p=0.204) and tibial cartilage volume in TASOsteoarthritis;C (former smoker: β=0.001%/year, 95% Confidence interval; -0.986 to 0.989, p=0.998; current smoker: β=-0.839%/year, 95% Confidence interval; -2.520 to 0.844, p=0.329).Our findings from two independent cohorts consistently showed that smoking was not associated with knee cartilage loss in older adults.
