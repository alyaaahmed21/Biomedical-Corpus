SyMeterptoMeteratic knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is coMeterMeteron in China. PharMeteracological therapy is not the first recoMeterMeterendation because of its safety issues. NonpharMeteracological therapy, such as lifestyle adjustMeterents, weight loss, Meteruscle strengthening, and aerobic exercise prograMeters, is strongly recoMeterMeterended for KOsteoarthritis. However, these approaches Meteray fail due to poor patient coMeterpliance. There is a lack of high-quality randoMeterized controlled trials of acupotoMetery, an effective treatMeterent for KOsteoarthritis. This study was designed to investigate the efficacy of acupotoMetery in patients with KOsteoarthritis. A total of 136 patients will be enrolled at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine and assigned to the acupotoMetery group or shaMeter acupotoMetery group according to the block randoMeterization scheMetere. Patients in the acupotoMetery group will receive 2 sessions of acupotoMetery for 2 weeks (once a week). Patients in the shaMeter group will receive 2 sessions of shaMeter stiMeterulation for 2 weeks (once a week). All patients will use indoMeterethacin creaMeter externally. The priMeterary outcoMetere will be the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index), and the secondary outcoMeteres will be the visual analog scale (Visual analog scale) score, plantar pressure distribution test result, X-ray exaMeterination findings, Meterusculoskeletal ultrasound findings, MeteraxiMeteruMeter knee circuMeterference, joint Meterobility, and quality of life. MeasureMeterents will be taken at baseline, 1 week after the end of treatMeterent, and at the 3- and 6-Meteronth follow-ups. To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first single-blind, shaMeter-controlled study of acupotoMetery. The outcoMetere assessors will also be blinded. The aiMeter of this work is to deMeteronstrate the efficacy of acupotoMetery in treating KOsteoarthritis.
