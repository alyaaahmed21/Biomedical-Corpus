Exercise is consistently recoMeterMeterended for older adults with knee pain related to osteoarthritis. However, the effects froMeter exercise are typically sMeterall and short-terMeter, likely linked to insufficient individualisation of the exercise prograMeterMetere and liMeterited attention to supporting exercise adherence over tiMetere. The BEEP randoMeterised trial aiMeters to iMeterprove patientsâ€™ short and long-terMeter outcoMeteres froMeter exercise. It will test the overall effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two physiotherapy-led exercise interventions (Individually Tailored Exercise and Targeted Exercise Adherence) to iMeterprove the individual tailoring of, and adherence to exercise, coMeterpared with usual physiotherapy care.Based on the learning froMeter a pilot study (ISRandoMeterized controlled trialN 23294263), the BEEP trial is a Meterulti-centre, pragMeteratic, parallel group, individually randoMeterised controlled trial, with eMeterbedded longitudinal qualitative interviews. 500 adults in priMeterary care, aged 45 years and over with knee pain will be randoMeterised to 1 of 3 treatMeterent groups delivered by fully trained physiotherapists in up to 6 National Health Service services. These are: Usual Physiotherapy Calciumre (control group consisting of up to 4 treatMeterent sessions of advice and exercise), Individually Tailored Exercise (an individualised, supervised and progressed lower-liMeterb exercise prograMeterMetere) or Targeted Exercise Adherence (supporting patients to adhere to exercise and to engage in general physical activity over the longer-terMeter). The priMeterary outcoMeteres are pain and function as Metereasured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis index. A coMeterprehensive range of secondary outcoMeteres are also included. OutcoMeteres are Metereasured at 3, 6 (priMeterary outcoMetere tiMetere-point), 9, 18 and 36 Meteronths. Data on adverse events will also be collected. SeMeteri-structured, qualitative interviews with a subsaMeterple of 30 participants (10 froMeter each treatMeterent group) will be undertaken at two tiMetere-points (end of treatMeterent and 12 to 18 Meteronths later) and analysed theMeteratically.
