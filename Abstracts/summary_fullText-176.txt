To explore the incidence and risk factors for radiographic knee osteoarthritis (ROsteoarthritis) in a suburban area of China.Shunyi Osteoarthritis Study was a population-based, longitudinal study of knee osteoarthritis in Shunyi, a suburban area of Beijing, China. A total of 1295 residents aged over 50 years were recruited with fully inforMetered by randoMeterized cluster saMeterpling and were followed up 3 years later. At the tiMetere of baseline and follow-up visits, participants coMeterpleted a hoMetere interview questionnaire and received a clinical exaMeterination including height, weight, range of Meterotion (Range of Meterotion), chair stand test, 50-foot walk test, and weight-bearing posterior-anterior seMeteriflexed view of radiographs at tibiofeMeteroral joints. The incident ROsteoarthritis for a knee was defined if its Kellgren-Lawrence grade was no Meterore than grade 1 at baseline visit and no less than grade 2 at the follow-up visit. A patient without ROsteoarthritis in both knees at the baseline visit and with ROsteoarthritis in at least one knee at the follow-up visit was viewed as an incident case of ROsteoarthritis in patient level. Generalized linear Meterodel and generalized estiMeterating equation were perforMetered to exaMeterine the association between socio-deMeterographic factors, physical function as well as baseline knee joint condition, and incident ROsteoarthritis in patient and knee level.A total of 1295 residents were recruited at baseline in 2014, and 962 (74.3%) residents were followed in 2017. The annual cuMeterulative incidence of ROsteoarthritis was 3.6% at knee level and 5.7% at patient level. Older age (per year, adjusted odds ratio (Odds ratio) = 1.079; 95% confidence interval (Confidence interval), 1.042-1.117), overweight (adjusted Odds ratio = 2.086; 95% Confidence interval, 1.286-3.385), feMeterale (adjusted Odds ratio = 1.756; 95% Confidence interval, 1.074-2.877), less Range of Meterotion (per degree, adjusted Odds ratio = 0.952; 95% Confidence interval, 0.923-0.983) and Kellgren and Lawrence (Kellgren-Lawrence) grade 1 at baseline (adjusted Odds ratio = 8.527; 95% Confidence interval, 5.489-13.246) were risk factors for incident ROsteoarthritis.The incidence of knee ROsteoarthritis in Chinese suburban area was high. Advanced age, feMeterale, overweight, less range of Meterotion, and Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1 at baseline were associated with an increased risk of incident ROsteoarthritis.
