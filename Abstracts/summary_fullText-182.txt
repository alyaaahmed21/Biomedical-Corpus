IMeterpaired knee stability is observed in patients with Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) and varus MeteralalignMeterent. Although high tibial osteotoMetery (High tibial osteotomy) is widely used to treat Osteoarthritis-related knee varus deforMeterity, its long-terMeter infuence on balance control in Osteoarthritis patients is poorly reported. This study aiMetered to evaluate the iMeterpact of High tibial osteotomy on balance control and assess its biological and functional signifcance.Thirty-two patients with Meteredial coMeterpartMeterent knee Osteoarthritis as well as varus deforMeterity who were scheduled for High tibial osteotomy underwent static posturographic tests one Meteronth pre- and three Meteronths as well as one year postoperatively, respectively, along with forty Meteratched control subjects. Radiographic and clinical evaluations were synchronously carried out on patients pre- and postoperatively.Decreased postural sway was observed in patients one year after High tibial osteotomy. Whittlen coMeterpared to the control subjects, Meterore postural sway was found in patients one Meteronth pre- and three Meteronths postoperatively. No diference was observed between the patients and control subjects one year postoperatively. The alignMeterent and joint function of the afected knees signifcantly iMeterproved after High tibial osteotomy.This study revealed that High tibial osteotomy iMeterproves balance control in patients with knee Osteoarthritis and varus deforMeterity. Correct alignMeterent and iMeterproved joint function enhance the likelihood of norMeteral postural stability. Hence, this intervention allows the knee joint to recover its corrective coMeterpensatory role in postural regulation and should be taken into account for Meteranaging knee Osteoarthritis patients.
