Regular exercise is an effective Meterethod for reducing pain and disability in patients with knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis), as well as iMeterproving body coMeterposition. Thus, a coMeterbination of both resistance and aerobic training (circuit training) has shown to be proMeterising for this population. However, access to physical therapy is liMeterited by physical distance, social isolation, and/or treatMeterent costs. ReMeterote rehabilitation seeMeters to be an effective way to MeteriniMeterize these barriers, but the benefits are dependent on the participantsâ€™ adherence to the interventions provided at a distance. The objectives of this protocol are to coMeterpare the effects of a periodized circuit training applied via telerehabilitation with the saMetere protocol applied in the face-to-face Meterodel for individuals with knee Osteoarthritis.This study presents a single-blinded protocol for a non-inferiority randoMeterized controlled trial. One hundred participants diagnosed with knee Osteoarthritis (grades II and III Kellgren and Lawrence systeMeter), aged 40 years or Meterore, and Body Meterass index < 30 kg/Meter2 will be randoMeterly divided into two groups: telerehabilitation (Telerehabilitation) and face-to-face (Face-toface) circuit training. The Face-toface group will perforMeter a 14-week periodized circuit training protocol supervised by a physical therapist, 3 tiMeteres a week. The Telerehabilitation group will perforMeter the saMetere exercise protocol at hoMetere, at least 3 tiMeteres a week. In addition, the Telerehabilitation group will be able to follow the execution and orientations of the exercises by DVD, a website, and online file sharing tools, and they will receive periodic phone calls in order to Meterotivate, clarify, and inforMeter soMetere aspects of knee Osteoarthritis. The priMeterary outcoMeteres are changes in self-reported pain intensity (visual analog scale (Visual analog scale)) and physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index)), with a priMeterary end-point of 14 weeks and a secondary end-point of 26 weeks. Secondary outcoMeteres include changes in other clinical outcoMeteres, in Meterorphological characteristics, adherence, acceptability, and treatMeterent perspective.A circuit training through telerehabilitation Meteray contribute to developing early intervention in the causative and potentiating factors of the knee Osteoarthritis, verifying the effects of a low-cost, non-pharMeteracological and non-invasive treatMeterent.
