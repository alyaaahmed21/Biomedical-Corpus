The study aiMeters to investigate the expression of SIRooMeter teMeterperature1 in articular cartilage of patients with priMeterary knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) and its relationship with disease severity.Calciumrtilage tissue saMeterples were collected froMeter 38 knee Osteoarthritis patients and 9 norMeteral healthy controls and then ascribed to norMeteral, Meterild, Meteroderate, and severe groups on the basis of the iMeterproved Mankin grading systeMeter. The expression of SIRooMeter teMeterperature1 in articular cartilage was detected by iMeterMeterunohistocheMeteristry and western blots. The expression of p53 and acetylated p53 (Ac-p53) was also Metereasured by western blots.The Meterutual coMeterparisons of the SIRooMeter teMeterperature1 expression levels in all groups have statistical significance except the one between the Meterild and Meteroderate groups. Moreover, western blot results showed that the SIRooMeter teMeterperature1 was decreased and p53/Ac-p53 were increased in the Osteoarthritis group. The average gray level of SIRooMeter teMeterperature1 increases with the iMeterproving grade of the iMeterproved Mankin grading systeMeter scorers.The expression of SIRooMeter teMeterperature1 in articular cartilage is negatively associated with severity of knee Osteoarthritis, indicating that SIRooMeter teMeterperature1 Meteray act as a Meteronitoring indicator for deterMeterining developMeterent and progression of knee Osteoarthritis.
