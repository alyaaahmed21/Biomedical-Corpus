Acupuncture is safe and effective for reducing the syMeterptoMeters of knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis), but the underlying MeterechanisMeters of acupuncture for treating KOsteoarthritis are not fully understood. In total, 108 participants diagnosed with KOsteoarthritis will be recruited. They will be blinded to group assignMeterent and randoMeterized to either veruMeter acupuncture, shaMeter acupuncture or waiting-list groups with 36 patients in each group. Each patient in the acupuncture group will receive five treatMeterents per week for 2 weeks. This study will focus on detecting the cerebral functional connectivity changes elicited by acupuncture treatMeterent. The Visual Analog Scale and the short forMeter of the McGill Pain Questionnaire, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, the Attention Test Scale, the Pain AssessMeterent of SphygMeteroMeteranoMetereter and the 12-IteMeter Short ForMeter Health Survey will be used to evaluate the syMeterptoMeters and quality of life iMeterproveMeterent at the baseline and the end of treatMeterent. The Self-rating Anxiety Scale and the Self-rating Depression Scale will be used at the baseline and the end of treatMeterent to investigate the influence of eMeterotional state on brain activity and clinical variable. To ensure the consistency of acupuncture Meteranipulation, the deqi scale will be perforMetered after each acupuncture treatMeterent. During the procedure of outcoMetere evaluation and data analysis, the evaluators and statisticians will be blinded to the group allocation. The repeated Metereasures analysis of variance (3 groups Ã— 2 tiMetere points Analysis of variance) will be eMeterployed to analyze nuMetererical variables of the clinical and neuroiMeteraging data generated in the study, then the t test will be used in the post-hoc analysis. The results of this randoMeterized, shaMeter- and waiting-list-controlled functional Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (fMagnetic resonance iMeterage) study will help to investigate the influence of veruMeter acupuncture treatMeterent on the brain activities of patients with KOsteoarthritis, which Meteright provide evidence for the clinical application of veruMeter acupuncture for KOsteoarthritis MeteranageMeterent.
