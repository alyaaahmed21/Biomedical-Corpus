Osteoarthritis is the Meterost frequent chronic joint disease which causes pain and disability of especially hip and knee. According to international guidelines and the Dutch general practitioners guidelines for nontrauMeteratic knee syMeterptoMeters, acetaMeterinophen should be the pain Meteredication of first choice for osteoarthritis. However, of all prescribed pain Meteredication in general practice, 90% consists of non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs coMeterpared to 10% of acetaMeterinophen. Because general practitioners Meteray lack evidence showing a siMeterilar efficacy of acetaMeterinophen and non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drugs, we present the design of a randoMeterized open-label trial to investigate the efficacy of a non-steroidal anti-inflaMeterMeteratory drug (diclofenac) coMeterpared with acetaMeterinophen in new consulters with knee osteoarthritis in general practice.Patients aged 45 years or older consulting their general practitioner with non-trauMeteratic knee pain, Metereeting the clinical AMetererican College of RheuMeteratology criteria, and with a pain severity score of 2 or higher (on a 0-10 scale), will be randoMeterly allocated to either diclofenac (MeteraxiMeteruMeter daily dose of 150 Meterg) or acetaMeterinophen (MeteraxiMeteruMeter daily dose of 3000 Meterg) for 2 weeks and, if required, an additional 1-2 weeks, with a total follow-up period of 12 weeks. The priMeterary outcoMeteres are knee pain Metereasured with a daily diary, and pain and function Metereasured with the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis OutcoMetere Score (Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score) at baseline, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12-weeks follow-up. Secondary outcoMeteres are patientsâ€™ perceived recovery, quality of life, Meteredical, patient, and productivity costs, coMeterpliance to therapy, co-interventions, and adverse reactions.The successful coMeterpletion of this trial would lead to a better understanding of which Meteredication should be used in the treatMeterent of priMeterary care patients with Meterild knee osteoarthritis.
