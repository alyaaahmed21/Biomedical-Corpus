Single 6 ml Hylan G-F 20 injection, is indicated for knee osteoarthritis patients who have failed to respond to non-pharmacologic therapy and/or simple analgesics. To obtain more thorough understanding of the clinical efficacy and safety, a randomized clinical trial was conducted comparing intra-articular (Intraarticular;) administration of single 6 ml Hylan G-F 20 injection versus placebo in knee Osteoarthritis; patients of Chinese ethnicity. This was a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in 21 centers across China. Four hundred forty adults with knee Osteoarthritis; received a single 6 ml Hylan G-F 20 or placebo injection and were evaluated for clinical efficacy and safety outcomes over 26 weeks. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis; (Western Ontario McMaster Universities.) A1 index, treatment-emergent adverse events (Treatment-emergent adverse events;) and standard safety parameters were measured at pre-injection, and at weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 26 post-injection.Four hundred forty patients (male: 98 ; female: 342 ) were randomized. The mean age  was 61.5 (7.9) years. All patients were of East Asian ethnicity. Mean Western Ontario McMaster Universities. A1 score at baseline was 5.3 (1.2) and 5.2 (1.3) in single 6 ml Hylan G-F 20 injection and placebo groups, respectively. Significant reductions of Western Ontario McMaster Universities. A1 score were observed in both treatment groups when compared to baseline at 26 weeks post-injection, with the mean reduction of  -2.146 (0.108)/− 40.5% and − 2.271 (0.110) /− 43.7% in the single 6 ml Hylan G-F 20 injection and the placebo groups, respectively. Additionally, clinically important reductions in pain at 26 weeks was reported in 67.0 and 68.2% in single 6 ml Hylan G-F 20 injection and placebo groups (p = 0.36). Regarding safety, Treatment-emergent adverse events; were similar between the two treatment groups (hylan G-F 20 single: 61.5%; placebo: 64.5%).While the magnitude of the effect of a single 6 ml Hylan G-F 20 injection in this study is consistent with previously published literature with respect to the efficacy and safety of the drug, the current study shows a strong Intraarticular; placebo effect and did not established superiority of single 6 ml Hylan G-F 20 injection over Intraarticular; placebo in Chinese knee Osteoarthritis; patients.
