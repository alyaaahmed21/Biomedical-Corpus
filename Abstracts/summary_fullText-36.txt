The classifcation of knee osteoarthritis is an essential clinical issue, particularly in terms of diagnosing early knee osteoarthritis. However, the evaluation of three-dimensional limb alignment on two-dimensional radiographs is limited. This study evaluated the three-dimensional changes induced by weight-bearing in the alignments of lower limbs at various stages of knee osteoarthritis. Forty fve knees of 25 patients (69.9 ± 8.9 years) with knee Osteoarthritis; were examined in the study. Computed tomography; images of the entire leg were obtained in the supine and standing positions using conventional Computed tomography; and 320-row detector upright Computed tomography;, respectively. Next, the diferences in the three-dimensional alignment of the entire leg in the supine and standing positions were obtained using Three-dimensional;-Three-dimensional; surface registration technique, and those were compared for each Kellgren–Lawrence grade. Greater fexion, adduction, and tibial internal rotation were observed in the standing position, as opposed to the supine position. Kellgren–Lawrence grades 1 and 4 showed signifcant diferences in fexion, adduction, and tibial internal rotation between two postures. Grades 2 and 4 showed signifcant diferences in adduction, while grades 1 and 2, and 1 and 3 showed signifcant diferences in tibial internal rotation between standing and supine positions. Weight-bearing makes greater the three-dimensional deformities in knees with osteoarthritis. Particularly, greater tibial internal rotation was observed in patients with grades 2 and 3 compared to those with grade 1. The greater tibial internal rotation due to weight-bearing is a key pathologic feature to detect early osteoarthritic change in knees undergoing osteoarthritis.
