Platelet-rich plasMetera (Platelet-rich plasma) contains various growth factors and infaMeterMeteratory regulators, which can efectively reduce infaMeterMeteration in joints and proMeterote tissue repair. Multiple studies have proved its efectiveness in the treatMeterent of knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis). Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) and transcutaneous electrical nerve stiMeterulation (TENormal saline) are non-invasive and safe physical therapy Meterethods for KOsteoarthritis. This study is the frst to propose the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis with physical stiMeterulation after Platelet-rich plasma treatMeterent, and to observe the clinical efcacy of the treat‑ Meterent Meterethod. This is a protocol paper that outlines a randoMeterized controlled trial, patients will be assigned randoMeterly to the Platelet-rich plasma group, Platelet-rich plasma+LIFU group, Platelet-rich plasma+TENormal saline group, and Platelet-rich plasma+LIFU coMeterbined TENormal saline group. The patients will be followed at 12-week and 24-week tiMetere points to evaluate the priMeterary and secondary outcoMeteres of the study. The priMeterary outcoMetere is the Visual analog scale pain score. Secondary outcoMeteres include Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) and International Knee DocuMeterentation CoMeterMeterittee scores (IKDC). After baseline exaMeteri‑ nation, all patients will sign a written inforMetered consent for study participation after a full explanation of the treatMeterent protocol. We have planned a total of 120 patients (30 patients per group). The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efect of diferent physical stiMeterulation after Platelet-rich plasma treat‑ Meterent for KOsteoarthritis. The data will be published after the coMeterpletion of the study.
