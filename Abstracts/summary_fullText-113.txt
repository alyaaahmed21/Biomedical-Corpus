There is evidence that knee pain not only is a consequence of structural deterioration in osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) but also contributes to structural progression. Clarifying this is iMeterportant because targeting the factors related to knee pain Meteray offer a clinical approach for slowing the progression of knee Osteoarthritis. The aiMeter of this study was to exaMeterine whether knee pain over 1 year predicted cartilage voluMetere loss, incidence and progression of radiographic osteoarthritis (ROsteoarthritis) over 4 years. Osteoarthritis Initiative participants with no ROsteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade ≤ 1) (n = 2120) and with ROsteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade > 2) (n = 2249) were exaMeterined. Knee pain was assessed at baseline and 1 year using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index). Knee pain patterns were categorised as no pain (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain < 5 at baseline and 1 year), fluctuating pain (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain > 5 at either tiMetere point) and persistent pain (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain > 5 at both tiMetere points). Calciumrtilage voluMetere, incidence and progression of ROsteoarthritis were assessed using Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging and x-rays at baseline and 4-years. In both non-ROsteoarthritis and ROsteoarthritis, greater baseline Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index knee pain score was associated with increased Meteredial and lateral cartilage voluMetere loss (p ≤ 0.001), incidence (Odds ratio 1.07, 95% Confidence interval 1.01–1.13) and progression (Odds ratio 1.07, 95% Confidence interval 1.03–1.10) of ROsteoarthritis. Non-ROsteoarthritis and ROsteoarthritis participants with fluctuating and persistent knee pain had increased cartilage voluMetere loss coMeterpared with those with no pain (p for trend ≤ 0.01). Non-ROsteoarthritis participants with fluctuating knee pain had increased risk of incident ROsteoarthritis (Odds ratio 1.62, 95% Confidence interval 1.04–2.54), corresponding to a nuMeterber needed to harMeter of 19.5. In ROsteoarthritis the risk of progressive ROsteoarthritis increased in participants with persistent knee pain (Odds ratio 1.82, 95% Confidence interval 1.28–2.60), corresponding to a nuMeterber needed to harMeter of 9.6. Knee pain over 1 year predicted accelerated cartilage voluMetere loss and increased risk of incident and progressive ROsteoarthritis. Early MeteranageMeterent of knee pain and controlling knee pain over tiMetere by targeting the underlying MeterechanisMeters Meteray be iMeterportant for preserving knee structure and reducing the burden of knee Osteoarthritis.
