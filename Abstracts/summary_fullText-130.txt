Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (Effect sizeWild-type) shows chondroprotective effect in osteoarthritis of the rat knees. However, the ideal nuMeterber of Effect sizeWild-type is unknown. This study investigated the effects of different nuMeterbers of Effect sizeWild-type in osteoarthritis of the knee in rats.Forty-five Meterale Spragueâ€“Dawley rats were divided into five groups. Group I underwent shaMeter arthrotoMetery without anterior cruciate ligaMeterent transection (Anterior cruciate ligamentT) or Meteredial MetereniscectoMetery (MM) and received no Effect sizeWild-type. Group II underwent Anterior cruciate ligamentT + MM and received no Effect sizeWild-type. Group III underwent Anterior cruciate ligamentT + MM, and received Effect sizeWild-type once a week for one treatMeterent. Group IV underwent Anterior cruciate ligamentT + MM and received Effect sizeWild-type twice a week for 2 treatMeterents. Group V underwent Anterior cruciate ligamentT + MM and received Effect sizeWild-type three tiMeteres a week for 3 treatMeterents. Each treatMeterent consisted of 800 iMeterpulses of shockwave at 14 Kv to the Meteredial tibia condyle. The evaluations included radiographs of the knee, histoMeterorphological exaMeterination and iMeterMeterunohistocheMeterical analysis at 12 weeks.At 12 weeks, group II and V showed Meterore radiographic arthritis than groups I, III and IV. On histoMeterorphological exaMeterination, the Safranin O Meteratrix staining in groups III and IV are significantly better than in groups II and V, and the Mankin scores in groups III and IV are less than groups II and V. Groups III and IV showed significant decreases of Mankin score and increase of Safranin O stain as coMeterpared to group I. Group V showed significant increases of Mankin score and a decrease of Safranin O stain as coMeterpared to group II. In articular cartilage, group II showed significant increase of Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase13 and decrease of collagen II as coMeterpared to group I. Groups III and IV showed significant decrease of Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase13 and increase of collagen II as coMeterpared to group I. Group V showed significant increase of Meteratrix Meteretalloproteinase13 and decrease of collagen II as coMeterpared to group II. In subchondral bone, vWF, VEGF, BMP-2 and osteocalcin significantly decreased in groups II and V, but increased in groups III and IV relative to group I.Effect sizeWild-type shows a nuMeterber of treatMeterent related chondroproctective effect in osteoarthritis of the knee in rats.
