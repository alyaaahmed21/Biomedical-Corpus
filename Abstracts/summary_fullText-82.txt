From February 2015 to December 2020, 17 patients who had total knee arthroplasty implanted with a long stemmed tibial component were included in the study. Patient data were analyzed for knee range of motion, deformities, Knee Society score, knee function score, and time to fracture union in the pre- and postoperative periods. The mean follow-up duration was 22.7±11.68 months (range 12–60 months), and mean time to fracture healing was 10.23±2.81 weeks (range 8–20 weeks). The preoperative mean fxed fexion deformity improved from 8.53±3.43° to a mean of 0.29°, and knee fexion improved from 79.4±13.90° to 125.29±8.74° on postoperative assessment. The Knee Society score improved from a mean preoperative score of 18.94±5.55 (range 8–28) to 89.41±7.5 (range 74–102, p value<0.001). Similarly, the knee function score improved signifcantly from a mean preoperative score of 15.5±4.48 (range 8–26) to a mean of 85±6.09 (range 72–94, p value<0.001). Total knee arthroplasty using long tibial extenders has been an efective and safe surgical option for patients with advanced osteoarthritis with tibial stress fractures.
