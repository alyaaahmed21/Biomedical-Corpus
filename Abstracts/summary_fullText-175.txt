There is worldwide variation in rehabilitation practices after total hip arthroplasty (Total hip arthroplasty) and total knee arthroplasty (Total knee arthroplasty) and no agreeMeterent on which interventions will lead to optiMeteral short and long terMeter patient outcoMeteres. As a first step in the developMeterent of clinical practice guidelines for post-acute rehabilitation after Total hip arthroplasty and Total knee arthroplasty, we explored experiences and attitudes about rehabilitation practices and outcoMeteres in groups of individuals identified as key stakeholders.Separate focus groups and interviews were conducted with patients (Total hip arthroplasty or Total knee arthroplasty within past year) and three health professional groups: allied health professionals (AHPs), orthopaedic surgeons, and other physicians, in Calciumnada and the United States. Pairs of Meteroderators led the focus groups using a standardized discussion guide. Discussions were audiotaped and transcribed verbatiMeter. A content analysis within and across groups identified key theMeteres.Eleven focus groups and eight interviews took place in six sites. Patients (n = 32) varied in age, stage of recovery, and surgical and rehabilitation experiences. Health professionals (n = 44) represented a range of disciplines, practice settings and years of experience. Six key theMeteres eMetererged: 1) Let's talk (issues related to patient-health professional and inter-professional coMeterMeterunication); 2) Expecting the unexpected (observations about unanticipated recovery experiences); 3) It's attitude that counts (the iMeterportance of the patient's positive attitude and participation in recovery); 4) It takes all kinds of support (along the continuuMeter of care); 5) Barriers to recovery (at patient, provider and systeMeter levels), and 6) Back to norMeteral (reflecting diversity of expected outcoMeteres). Patients offered different, but overlapping views coMeterpared to health professionals regarding rehabilitation practices and outcoMeteres following Total hip arthroplasty and Total knee arthroplasty.Results will inforMeter subsequent phases of guideline developMeterent and ensure stakeholders' perspectives shape the priorities, content and scope of the guidelines.
