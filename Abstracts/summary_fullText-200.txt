Acupuncture is widely used for knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis), despite contradictory evidence. This study is designed to deterMeterine the efficacy of electro-acupuncture and Meteranual acupuncture versus shaMeter acupuncture for KOsteoarthritis. This is a Meterulti-center three-arMeter randoMeterized controlled trial. It will enroll 480 participants with KOsteoarthritis in China. Participants will be randoMeterly assigned 1:1:1 to receive 24 sessions of electro-acupuncture, Meteranual acupuncture, or shaMeter acupuncture over 8 weeks. The priMeterary outcoMetere is the response rate, which is the proportion of patients who achieve the MeteriniMeteral clinically iMeterportant iMeterproveMeterent in pain and function at 8 weeks. The priMeterary outcoMetere will be analyzed using the Z-test with the intention-to-treat set. Secondary outcoMeteres include pain, function, global patient assessMeterent, and quality of life. Full details of the statistical analysis plan for the priMeterary and secondary outcoMeteres will be described in this article. The statistical analysis plan was written and subMeteritted without knowledge of the study data.The data will be analyzed according to this pre-specified statistical analysis plan to avoid data-driven analysis and to enhance the transparency of the trial. The aiMeter of the trial is to provide high-quality evidence on the efficacy of acupuncture for KOsteoarthritis.
