Acupuncture is one of the Meterost popular coMeterpleMeterentary and alternative treatMeterents for knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis). There are Meterany Meterethods of acupuncture in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis, and the efects are diferent. According to our clinical observations and researches, it is found that Meteranual acupuncture (Manual acupuncture), electro-acupuncture (Electro-acupuncture), and warMeter acupuncture (WarMeter acupuncture) are used Meterore frequently in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis, and the curative efects are satisfactory. However, there is currently a lack of efcacy coMeterparison of efcacy between diferent acupuncture treatMeterents, as well as a lack of standardized clinical research on the acupuncture treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis. Therefore, we will carry out a high-quality clinical randoMeterized controlled trial to research the efect laws of Manual acupuncture, Electro-acupuncture, and WarMeter acupuncture on KOsteoarthritis.: A total of 200 eligible participants with KOsteoarthritis will be randoMeterly assigned to group A, B, C, or D in a ratio of 1:1:1:1. Patients in group A will receive Manual acupuncture, while those in group B, group C, and group D will be treated with Electro-acupuncture, WarMeter acupuncture, and shaMeter acupuncture (ShaMeter acupuncture), respectively. Patients will be treated with acupuncture once a day, 30 Meterin per session, 5 sessions per week for 4 weeks. The priMeterary outcoMetere is the change of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) at week 4. The secondary outcoMeteres include Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, visual analog scale (Visual analog scale), Arthritis Quality of Life MeasureMeterent Scale SiMeterplifed Scale (Arthritis Quality of Life MeasureMeterent Scale SiMeterplifed Scale), Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck Anxiety Inventory), Beck Depression Inventory (Beck Depression Inventory), and Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire. The evaluation will be perforMetered at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12 respectively after randoMeterization.This is a randoMeterized controlled trial. We will observe the clinical efect of Manual acupuncture, Electro-acupuncture, and WarMeter acupuncture on KOsteoarthritis to research the efect laws of these three acupuncture treatMeterents on KOsteoarthritis and set up standardized treatMeterent prograMeters for acupuncture for KOsteoarthritis.
