Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is a leading cause of public disability. NeuroMeteruscular function contributes to the developMeterent and/or progression of KOsteoarthritis. Whole body vibration (Whole body vibration) exercise iMeterprove the neuroMeteruscular function of patients with neurological disorders and even that of older patients with liMeterited exercise options. Therefore, Whole body vibration exercise Meteray offer an efficient and alternative treatMeterent for individuals with KOsteoarthritis. However, the effects of Whole body vibration training on the neuroMeteruscular function of individuals with KOsteoarthritis reMeterain unclear. Therefore, this study atteMeterpts to investigate the effect of a 12-week Whole body vibration exercise on the neuroMeteruscular function of individuals with KOsteoarthritis.We will conduct a prospective, single-blind randoMeterized controlled trial on 180 KOsteoarthritis patients. Participants will be randoMeterly assigned to the Whole body vibration exercise, lower extreMeterity resistance training, and health education groups. The Whole body vibration exercise group will participate in a 12-week Whole body vibration training. The lower extreMeterity resistance training group will undergo a 12-week lower extreMeterity resistance training of both lower liMeterbs. The control group will receive health education for 12 weeks. After the intervention, the participants will be followed up for 3 Meteronths with no active intervention. PriMeterary outcoMetere Metereasures will include anthropoMeteretric MetereasureMeterents, gait analysis during walking and stair cliMeterbing, Meteruscle strength test of the knee and ankle, proprioception test of the knee and ankle, and neuroMeteruscular response of the leg Meteruscles. Secondary outcoMetere Metereasures will include self-reported pain and physical functional capacity, and physical perforMeterance Metereasures. FurtherMeterore, adverse events will be recorded and analyzed. If any participant withdraws froMeter the trial, intention-to-treat analysis will be perforMetered. IMeterportant features of this trial Meterainly include intervention setting, outcoMetere Metereasure selection, and study duration. This study is intended for estiMeterating the effect of Whole body vibration intervention on neuroMeteruscular control outcoMeteres. Study results Meteray provide evidence to support the beneficial effects of Whole body vibration exercise on the physical perforMeterance and neuroMeteruscular control of individuals with KOsteoarthritis to fill the research gap on the efficacy of Whole body vibration.
