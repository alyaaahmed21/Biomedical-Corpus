Pain in osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) has been classically attributed to joint structural daMeterage. Disparity between the degree of radiographic structural daMeterage and the severity of syMeterptoMeters iMeterplies that factors other than the joint pathology itself contribute to the pain. Peripheral and central sensitization have been suggested as two of the underlying MeterechanisMeters that contribute to pain in Osteoarthritis. The aiMeter of this study was to explore in syMeterptoMeteratic knee Osteoarthritis patients, the structural changes assessed by Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage) that could be used as Meterarkers of neuropathic pain (neuropathic pain). This cross-sectional observational pilot study included 50 knee Osteoarthritis patients with Meteroderate to severe pain (Visual analog scale ≥40) in the target knee. The presence of neuropathic pain was deterMeterined based on the PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography questionnaire. AMeterong the 50 patients included, 25 had PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography score ≤12 (unlikely neuropathic pain), 9 had PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography score between 13 and 18 (uncertain neuropathic pain) and 16 had PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography score ≥19 (likely neuropathic pain). Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography, and Visual analog scale pain scores as well as knee Magnetic resonance iMeterage were assessed. Data showed no significant difference in deMeterographic characteristics between the three groups. However, a positive and statistically significant association was found between the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain (P <0.001), function (P <0.001), stiffness (P = 0.007) and total (P <0.001) scores as well as higher Visual analog scale pain score (P = 0.023), and PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography scores. Although no difference was found in the cartilage voluMetere between groups, the presence of Metereniscal extrusion in both Meteredial (P = 0.006) and lateral (P = 0.023) coMeterpartMeterents, and presence of Metereniscal tears in the lateral coMeterpartMeterent (P = 0.011), were significantly associated with increasing PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography score. Moreover, the presence of bone Meterarrow lesions in the lateral plateau and the extent of the synovial MetereMeterbrane thickness in the lateral recess were associated with increasing PainDETECoMeterputed toMeterography scores (P = 0.032, P = 0.027, respectively). In this study, Metereniscal lesions, particularly extrusion, were found to be aMeterong the strongest risk factors for neuropathic pain in knee Osteoarthritis patients.
