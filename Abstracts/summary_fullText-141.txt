Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis), though being treated via various Meterethods and Meteredicines, is still a Meterajor healthcare concern Meterostly due to the increase in diagnosis of these age-related diseases. The present study aiMetered at investigating the effects of oral and intra articular injection of grape seed oil on Osteoarthritis in Meterale rat Meterodels.: Seventy Meterale rats were selected and their anterior cruciate ligaMeterent was cut to induce Osteoarthritis. They were divided into 7 groups (n = 10): C1, no treatMeterent; C2, receiving 300 Meterg/day of Piascledine per os (PO); C3, 1 Meterg sodiuMeter hyaluronate intra-articularly in days 1, 7, 14; C4, 1 Meterg Meterethyl-prednisolone acetate intraarticularly; E1, avocado and grape seed oil coMeterbination (2:1, 300 Meterg/day) PO; E2, 500 Meterg/day of grape seed oil PO; E3, 200 Meterg/day grape seed oil intra-articularly. After 10 weeks, the rats were anesthetized and evaluated radiologically and histopathologically. P value ≤ 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.All the groups Meterade significant differences with C1 regarding all inspected radiological criteria (P ≤ 0.05). E1 and E3 showed significantly better effects on Meteredial feMeteroral condyle, Meteredial tibial condyle, joint space width, total osteophyte, and Osteoarthritis scores (P ≤ 0.04). Joint surface, Meteratrix, cell distribution, cell population viability, calcification, and subchondral bone in treatMeterent groups had significantly better scores versus C1 (P ≤ 0.04). E1 and E3 had significantly superior results regarding joint surface, cell viability, and calcification (P ≤ 0.04).: Grape seed oil has protective effects, both in injectable forMeter and PO in coMeterbination with avocado, on Osteoarthritis in rats. Further clinical trials are necessary.
