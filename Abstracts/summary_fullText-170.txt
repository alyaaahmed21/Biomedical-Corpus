The efficacy and safety of a dietary suppleMeterent derived froMeter South AMetererican botanicals was coMeterpared to glucosaMeterine sulfate in osteoarthritis subjects in a MuMeterbai-based Meterulti-center, randoMeterized, double-blind study.Subjects (n = 95) were screened and randoMeterized to receive glucosaMeterine sulfate (n = 47, 1500 Meterg/day) or reparagen (n = 48, 1800 Meterg/day), a polyherbal consisting of 300 Meterg of vincaria (Uncaria guianensis) and 1500 Meterg of RNI 249 (LepidiuMeter Metereyenii) adMeterinistered orally, twice daily. PriMeterary efficacy variable was response rate based on a 20% iMeterproveMeterent in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain scores. Additional outcoMeteres were Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores for pain, stiffness and function, visual analog score (Visual analog scale) for pain, with assessMeterents at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks. Tolerability, investigator and subject global assessMeterents and rescue Meteredication consuMeterption (paracetaMeterol) were Metereasured together with safety assessMeterents including vital signs and laboratory based assays.Subject randoMeterization was effective: age, gender and disease status distribution was siMeterilar in both groups. The response rates (20% reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain) were substantial for both glucosaMeterine (89%) and reparagen (94%) and supported by investigator and subject assessMeterents. Using related criteria response rates to reparagen were favorable when coMeterpared to glucosaMeterine. CoMeterpared to baseline both treatMeterents showed significant benefits in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and Visual analog scale outcoMeteres within one week (P < 0.05), with a siMeterilar, progressive iMeterproveMeterent over the course of the 8 week treatMeterent protocol (45â€“62% reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index or Visual analog scale scores). Tolerability was excellent, no serious adverse events were noted and safety paraMetereters were unchanged. Rescue Meteredication use was significantly lower in the reparagen group (p < 0.01) at each assessMeterent period. SeruMeter IGF-1 levels were unaltered by treatMeterents.Both reparagen and glucosaMeterine sulfate produced substantial iMeterproveMeterents in pain, stiffness and function in subjects with osteoarthritis. Response rates were high and the safety profile was excellent, with significantly less rescue Meteredication use with reparagen. Reparagen represents a new natural productive alternative in the MeteranageMeterent of joint health.
