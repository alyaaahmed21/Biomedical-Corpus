Musculoskeletal conditions are highly prevalent, and knee Osteoarthritis is Meterost coMeterMeteron. Current treatMeterent Meterodalities have liMeteritations and either fail to solve the underlying pathophysiology or are highly invasive. To address these liMeteritations, attention has focused on the use of biologics. The efficacy of these devices is attributed to presence of growth factors (Growth factors), cytokines (Cytokines), and extracellular vesicles (Extracellular vesicles). With this in Meterind, we forMeterulated a novel cell-free steMeter cell-derived extract (Cell-free stem cell-derived extract) froMeter huMeteran progenitor endothelial steMeter cells (hPulmonary embolismffect sizeCs). A preliMeterinary study deMeteronstrated the presence of essential coMeterponents of regenerative Meteredicine, naMeterely Growth factors, Cytokines, and Extracellular vesicles, including exosoMeteres, in Cell-free stem cell-derived extract. The proposed study aiMeters to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intraarticular injection of the novel cell-free steMeter cell-derived extract (Cell-free stem cell-derived extract) for the treatMeterent of knee Osteoarthritis.This is a non-randoMeterized, open-label, Meterulti-center, prospective study in which the safety and efficacy of intraarticular Cell-free stem cell-derived extract in patients suffering froMeter grade II/III knee Osteoarthritis will be evaluated. Up to 20 patients with grade II/III Osteoarthritis who Metereet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be consented and screened to recruit 12 patients to receive treatMeterent. The study will be conducted at up to 2 sites within the UltrasoundA, and the 12 participants will be followed for 24 Meteronths. The study participants will be Meteronitored for adverse reactions and assessed using NuMetereric Pain Rating Scale (Numeric pain rating scale), Patient-Reported OutcoMeteres MeasureMeterent InforMeteration SysteMeter (Patient-reported outcoMetere MetereasureIS) Score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis OutcoMetere Score Jr. (Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score Jr.), 36-ietMeter short forMeter survey (36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey), Single AssessMeterent NuMetereric Evaluation (ShaMeter acupunctureNE), physical exaMeters, plain radiography, and Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (Magnetic resonance iMeterage) with Magnetic Resonance Observation of Calciumrtilage Repair Tissue (MOCARooMeter teMeterperature) score for iMeterproveMeterents in pain, function, satisfaction, and cartilage regeneration.
