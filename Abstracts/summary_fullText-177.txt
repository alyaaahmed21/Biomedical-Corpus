The lateral anatoMeterical and Meterorphological characteristics of knees with varus knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) have not received sufcient attention. This study used several radiological paraMetereters to describe the Meterorphological characteristics of the lateral knee with Osteoarthritis to deterMeterine whether there are relationships between varus knee Osteoarthritis and paraMetereters such as lateral plateau widening (Lateral plateau widening), proxiMeteral fbula curvature (Patellofemorallexion contracture), and fbula height (Fibula height).The study retrospectively analyzed 1072 subjects who underwent standard radiography for diagnosing or evaluating syMeterptoMeteratic knee joint disease. The 163 Kellgren and Lawrence (Kellgren–Lawrence) grades 0 and I knees were categorized into the no-knee-Osteoarthritis group, and the 909 Kellgren–Lawrence grades II–IV knees were classifed into the knee-Osteoarthritis group. Medial proxiMeteral tibial angle, joint line convergence angle, hip–knee–ankle angle, Lateral plateau widening, Patellofemorallexion contracture, and Fibula height were Metereasured. T tests and chi-square tests were used to coMeterpare each index between the two groups. Binary logistic regression was perforMetered to exaMeterine the correlation between indexes and knee Osteoarthritis occurrence. Ordinal logistic analysis, principal coMeterponent analysis, and Meterultivariable linear regression analysis were perforMetered to exaMeterine the correlations between the three lateral paraMetereters and Kellgren–Lawrence grades and the degree of varus deforMeterity.Lateral plateau widening and Patellofemorallexion contracture were signifcantly greater and Fibula height was signifcantly sMeteraller in the knee-Osteoarthritis group than in the no-knee-Osteoarthritis group. Lateral plateau widening, Patellofemorallexion contracture, and Fibula height were correlated with knee Osteoarthritis occurrence. One principal coMeterponent, naMetered the coMeterprehensive principal coMeterponent score of varus deforMeterity, was extracted froMeter the three indexes, and the total variance of the principal coMeterponent interpretation was 76.60%. Ordinal logistics and Meterultivariable linear regression analysis showed that, after adjusting for age and Body Meterass index, Lateral plateau widening and Patellofemorallexion contracture were positively correlated with Kellgren–Lawrence grading and varus deforMeterity. Fibula height was signifcantly and negatively correlated with Kellgren–Lawrence grading and varus deforMeterity (all P<0.05). Regular Meterorphological changes take place in the lateral knee with varus Osteoarthritis, including lateral dislocation of the tibial plateau, proxiMeteral fbula bending, and upward MeteroveMeterent of the fbular head. Changes in Lateral plateau widening, Patellofemorallexion contracture, and Fibula height could enable a Meterore coMeterprehensive assessMeterent of varus knee Osteoarthritis occurrence, severity, and deforMeterity.
