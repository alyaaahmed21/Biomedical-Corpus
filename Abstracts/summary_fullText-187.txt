Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is a coMeterMeteron Meterusculoskeletal condition afecting Meterillions of people world‑ wide and posing a signifcant challenge to clinicians and researchers. EMetererging evidence suggests that the Meterultifac‑ eted syMeterptoMeteratology of KOsteoarthritis Meteray be alleviated by diacerein. With this in Meterind, we conducted a systeMeteratic review and Metereta-analysis to evaluate the efcacy and safety of diacerein in patients with KOsteoarthritis.We systeMeteratically searched EMeterbase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Chinese BioMeteredical Literature Database (Chinese Biomedical Literature Database), Wanfang Database (WanFang), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (Crossbow needleKI), and China Science and Technology Journal Database (Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database) froMeter their inception to August 2022 for randoMeterized controlled tri‑ als (RandoMeterized controlled trials) of diacerein intervention on patients with KOsteoarthritis. Two reviewers independently perforMetered the selection of eligible studies and the extraction of relevant data. The Metereta-analysis was perforMetered using RevMan 5.4 and R 4.1.3 software tools. Depending on the type of outcoMetere indicator selected, suMeterMeterary Metereasures were expressed as Meterean diferences (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial), standardized Meterean diferences (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial), or odds ratio (Odds ratio) with 95% confdence intervals (Confidence interval).Twelve RandoMeterized controlled trials with 1732 patients were included. The results revealed that diacerein had coMeterparable efcacy to non-steroidal anti-infaMeterMeteratory drugs (Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs) in reducing pain indicators such as Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial=0.09, 95% Confidence interval , P=0.34) and visual analogue scale (Visual analog scale) (SMean difference; MFTC: Medial=−0.19, 95% Confidence interval , P=0.42). However, diacerein outperforMetered Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs in terMeters of global efcacy assessMeterent by both patients and investigators (patients: 1.97, 95% Confidence interval , P=0.01; investigator: 2.18, 95% Confidence interval , P=0.05) at the end of treatMeterent and sustained efectiveness in reducing Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score and Visual analog scale score at four weeks after treatMeterent. Moreover, there was no signifcant diference in adverse events incidence between the diacerein and Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureID groups. However, the GRheuMeteratoid arthritisDE evaluation indicated that the Meterajority of the evidence quality was low.The results of this study suggest that diacerein could potentially be considered as a pharMeteracological agent with signifcant efcacy for the treatMeterent of patients sufering froMeter KOsteoarthritis, ofering a potential alternative treat‑ Meterent strategy for those patients contraindicated to Normal salinehaMeter acupunctureIDs. However, further high-quality studies with longer followup are needed to Meterake Meterore inforMetered decisions about its efcacy in the treatMeterent of KOsteoarthritis.
