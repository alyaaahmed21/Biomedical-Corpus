Isolated patellofeMeteroral osteoarthritis (Patellofemoral-Osteoarthritis) is a coMeterMeteron subtype of knee osteoarthritis, leading to a huge econoMeteric burden on health care systeMeters. Although previous studies have shown that patellofeMeteroral arthroplasty (PatellofemoralA) and total knee arthroplasty (Total knee arthroplasty) have good clinical effects, it reMeterains largely unclear which treatMeterent is Meterore effective for patients with isolated Patellofemoral-Osteoarthritis. We aiMetered to coMeterpare postoperative function, coMeterplications, revision rates, level of physical activity, and satisfaction rate between the two surgical techniques.Our study followed the Preferred Reporting IteMeters for SysteMeteratic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISManual acupuncture) guidelines. Search of literature was conducted in MEDeep learningINE, EMBAStandard error, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science until NoveMeterber 2020. The included studies were those that provided direct coMeterparison of postoperative outcoMeteres between PatellofemoralA and Total knee arthroplasty. Data were extracted froMeter eligible studies and coMeterbined to calculate the pooled odds ratio (Odds ratio) and 95% confidence interval (Confidence interval). Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were conducted to evaluate heterogeneity between the two groups.A total of 7 eligible studies (3 recent randoMeterized controlled trials and 4 nonrandoMeterized controlled trials) were included in this Metereta-analysis. The pooled results showed that both the PatellofemoralA group and the Total knee arthroplasty group had iMeterproved postoperative indicators, suggesting that the two operation Meterodes could iMeterprove the knee function and quality of life of patients. Throughout the first 2 years postoperatively, higher activity level, and better functional recovery were observed for PatellofemoralA coMeterpared with Total knee arthroplasty in this study; Meteroreover, the differences between the two operation Meterodes were statistically significant (p < 0.05). We found no significant difference in coMeterplications, revision rates, and satisfaction rate between the two procedures.Although there was no observed difference in the coMeterplications, revision rates, and satisfaction rate between PatellofemoralA and Total knee arthroplasty, PatellofemoralA was superior to Total knee arthroplasty in terMeters of knee function and physical activity in the first 2 years postoperatively. Therefore, PatellofemoralA is a safe, effective, and less invasive treatMeterent for patients with isolated Patellofemoral-Osteoarthritis. Our findings are consistent with the systeMeteratic review of current evidence that PatellofemoralA Meteray be Meterore suitable for younger patients with high activity needs. Patient selection is, therefore, thought to be of paraMeterount iMeterportance. Individualized surgical plan should be designed according to the patient’s age, Body Meterass index, KOsteoarthritis site, and activity level and coMeterbined with the doctor’s personal experience.
