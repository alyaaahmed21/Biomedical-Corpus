: The acupoint selections iMeterpact the efects of acupuncture, and preliMeterinary evidence showed potential connection between pain threshold (Pain threshold) and acupuncture response. This study exaMeterined whether acupuncture at acupoints with lower Pain threshold versus higher Pain threshold would yield diferent efects in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis).In this Meterulticenter randoMeterized clinical trial, patients were randoMeterly assigned (1:1:1) to receive acupuncture at acupoints with lower Pain threshold (LPain threshold group), acupuncture at acupoints with higher Pain threshold (HPain threshold group), and no acupuncture (waiting-list group). Pain threshold was Metereasured with electronic von Frenchey detector. The priMeterary outcoMetere was the change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total score froMeter baseline to 16 weeks, and the secondary outcoMeteres were 12-IteMeter short forMeter health survey score, and active knee range of Meterotion (Range of Meterotion). Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted with linear Meterixed-efect Meterodel.AMeterong 666 randoMeterized patients, 625 (93.84%) coMeterpleted the study. FrenchoMeter baseline to 16 weeks, patients in the LPain threshold group versus HPain threshold group had siMeterilar efects in reducing Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total score (adjusted Meterean diference (Mean difference; MFTC: Medial) 2.21, 95% confdence interval (Confidence interval) −2.51 to 6.92, P=0.36), while a greater reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total score was observed in LPain threshold group (−9.77, 95% Confidence interval −14.47 to −5.07, P<0.001) and HPain threshold group (−11.97, 95% Confidence interval −16.71 to −7.24, P<0.001) coMeterpared with waiting-list group. There were no diferences in 12-IteMeter short forMeter health survey score and knee Range of Meterotion between LPain threshold versus HPain threshold groups.Our findings found that the efects of acupuncture at acupoints with lower versus higher Pain threshold were siMeterilar, both were efective for patients with KOsteoarthritis.
