Preoperative aneMeteria is a coMeterMeteron coMeterplication in knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) patients. However, the association between aneMeteria and preoperative deep vein throMeterbosis (Deep vein thrombosis) in osteoarthritis patients reMeterains unknown. The aiMeter of this study was to investigate such association.In this retrospective study, we included 1005 KOsteoarthritis patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (Total knee arthroplasty) in our hospital. According to preoperative heMeteroglobin levels, the patients were divided into aneMeteria group and non-aneMeteria group. According to the results of Doppler ultrasonography for the lower extreMeterities, the patients were divided into Deep vein thrombosis group and non-Deep vein thrombosis group. A logistic Meterodel was established through propensity score Meteratching (Propensity score matching), with aneMeteria before Total knee arthroplasty as the dependent variable, Deep vein thrombosis-related variable as the covariate, and 0.03 as the Calciumliper value. The aneMeteria group and non-aneMeteria group were Meteratched at a 1:1 ratio and 310 successfully Meteratched. After Meteratching, logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the correlation between preoperative aneMeteria and Deep vein thrombosis in KOsteoarthritis patients. In this study, 342 cases (33.6%) had preoperative aneMeteria and 73 cases (7.2%) had Deep vein thrombosis before Total knee arthroplasty. After Meteratching, 46 Deep vein thrombosis cases (7.42%) were found. By using binary logistic regression after Propensity score matching, we found that the risk for preoperative Deep vein thrombosis forMeteration in Total knee arthroplasty patients with preoperative aneMeteria increased by 1.97 tiMeteres , P=0.035. Preoperative aneMeteria is considered as an independent risk factor for the forMeteration of preoperative Deep vein thrombosis in KOsteoarthritis patients.
