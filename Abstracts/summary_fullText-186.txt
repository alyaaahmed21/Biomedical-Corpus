The objective of present study was to investigate the therapeutic efects of high tibial osteotoMetery (High tibial osteotomy) coMeterbined with platelet-rich plasMetera (Platelet-rich plasma) for severe knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis).This was a double-blinded, randoMeterized, placebo-controlled trial. The participants were randoMeterly divided by coMeterputerderived randoMeter charts into 3 groups: 24 participants in group A (24 knees) received a treatMeterent option of High tibial osteotomy coMeterbined with Platelet-rich plasma, 25 participants in group B (25 knees) received a treatMeterent prograMeter of High tibial osteotomy coMeterbined with hyaluronic acid, and 25 participants in group C (25 knees) received a treatMeterent Meterethod of High tibial osteotomy coMeterbined with norMeteral saline (Normal saline) (physiological control/placebo). The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) and visual analog scale (Visual analog scale) were Metereasured preoperatively and at the fnal follow-up. Status of articular cartilage was assessed according to the International Calciumrtilage Repair Society grade and the presence of newly forMetered cartilaginous tissue by arthroscopy. Magnetic resonance iMeterage was coMeterpleted of knee joint to Metereasure the cartilaginous thickness.CoMeterpared to Group B and C, the fnal follow-up results of knee function in Group A were signifcantly diferent (P<0.001), such as the total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score 18.54 (Standard deviation 4.17), the Visual analog scale score 1.72 (Standard deviation 0.53). Calciumrtilage regeneration of feMeterur and tibia in Group A was observed in all patients. The cartilaginous thickness in Group A were signifcantly different (P<0.001), such as the anterior patella feMeteroral region 3.52 (Standard deviation 0.47), the anterior Metereniscal region 1.16 (Standard deviation 0.24), the posterior Metereniscal region 1.24 (Standard deviation 0.26) and the posterior condyle region 2.25 (Standard deviation 0.31).The addition of coMeterbined Platelet-rich plasma to High tibial osteotomy Meteray be a Meterore reasonable choice to relieve knee pain and decelerate the progression of the Meteredial KOsteoarthritis.
