Knee osteoarthritis is a coMeterMeteron disease with pain as the Meterost prevalent syMeterptoMeter. Previous cohort studies have shown genicular artery eMeterbolization to reduce pain syMeterptoMeters in patients with Meterild to Meteroderate knee osteoarthritis. Patients resistant to conservative therapy but not eligible yet for surgical treatMeterent due to young age or coMeterorbidities Meteray profit froMeter an effective and sustained pain reduction treatMeterent. This study is a randoMeterized shaMeter-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of genicular artery eMeterbolization in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Fifty-eight patients with Meterild-to-Meteroderate knee osteoarthritis will be recruited and randoMeterly allocated to the treatMeterent or control group in a 1:1 ratio. Participants in the treatMeterent group will undergo genicular artery eMeterbolization. Patients in the control group will undergo shaMeter treatMeterent. OutcoMetere MetereasureMeterents will be assessed at baseline and after 1, 4, 8, and 12 Meteronths with questionnaires, pressure pain threshold testing, and MR iMeteraging. The MR iMeteraging protocol is designed to (seMeteri)quantitatively assess osteoarthritis in the knee joint. The priMeterary outcoMetere is the change froMeter baseline of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis OutcoMetere Score (Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcoMetere score) pain subscale after 4 Meteronths. Secondary outcoMeteres include change in osteoarthritis-related questionnaires, pressure pain threshold, and Osteoarthritis-related Magnetic resonance iMeterage features, particularly synovitis and bone Meterarrow lesions. This trial will deterMeterine the efficacy of genicular artery eMeterbolization coMeterpared to a shaMeter treatMeterent. This is of iMeterportance to assess before proceeding to larger-scale efficiency studies and, ultiMeterately, iMeterpleMeterenting this treatMeterent into day to day clinical practice.
