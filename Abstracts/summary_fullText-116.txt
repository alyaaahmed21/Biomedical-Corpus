The iMeterpleMeterentation of evidence based clinical practice guidelines on self-MeteranageMeterent interventions to patients with chronic diseases is a coMeterplex process. A Meterultifaceted strategy Meteray offer an effective knowledge translation (KT) intervention to proMeterote knowledge uptake and iMeterprove adherence in an effective walking prograMeter based on the Ottawa Panel Evidence Based Clinical Practice Guidelines aMeterong individuals with Meteroderate osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis).A single-blind, randoMeterized control trial was conducted. Patients with Meterild to Meteroderate (Osteoarthritis) of the knee (n=222) were randoMeterized to one of three KT groups: 1) Walking and Behavioural intervention (WB) (18 Meterales, 57 feMeterales) which included the supervised coMeterMeterunity-based aerobic walking prograMeter coMeterbined with a behavioural intervention and an educational paMeterphlet on the benefits of walking for Osteoarthritis; 2) Walking intervention (W) (24 Meterales, 57 feMeterales) wherein participants only received the supervised coMeterMeterunity-based aerobic walking prograMeter intervention and the educational paMeterphlet; 3) Self-directed control (C) (32 Meterales, 52 feMeterales) wherein participants only received the educational paMeterphlet. One-way analyses of variance were used to test for differences in quality of life, adherence, confidence, and clinical outcoMeteres aMeterong the study groups at each 3 Meteronth assessMeterent during the 12-Meteronth intervention period and 6-Meteronth follow-up period.: Short-terMeter prograMeter adherence was greater in WB coMeterpared to C (p<0.012) after 3 Meteronths. No statistical significance (p> 0.05) was observed for long-terMeter adherence (6 to 12 Meteronths), and total adherence between the three groups. The three knowledge translation strategies deMeteronstrated equivalent long-terMeter results for the iMeterpleMeterentation of a walking prograMeter for older individuals with Meteroderate Osteoarthritis. Lower dropout rates as well as higher retention rates were observed for WB at 12 and 18 Meteronths.The additional knowledge translation behavioural coMeterponent facilitated the iMeterpleMeterentation of clinical practice guidelines on walking over a short-terMeter period. More studies are needed to iMeterprove the long-terMeter walking adherence or longer guidelines uptake on walking aMeterong participants with Osteoarthritis. Particular attention should be taken into account related to patientâ€™s characteristic and preference. Osteoarthritis can be Meteranaged through the iMeterpleMeterentation of a walking prograMeter based on clinical practice guidelines in existing coMeterMeterunity-based walking clubs as well as at hoMetere with the MeteriniMeteral support of an exercise therapist or a trained volunteer.
