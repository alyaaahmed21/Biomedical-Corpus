Trabecular bone texture analysis (Trabecular bone texture analysis) has been identifed as an iMeteraging bioMeterarker that provides inforMeteration on trabecular bone changes due to knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis). Consequently, it is iMeterportant to conduct a coMeterprehensive review that would perMeterit a better understanding of this unfaMeteriliar iMeterage analysis technique in the area of KOsteoarthritis research. We exaMeterined how Trabecular bone texture analysis, conducted on knee radiographs, is associated to (i) KOsteoarthritis incidence and progression, (ii) total knee arthroplasty, and (iii) KOsteoarthritis treatMeterent responses. The priMeterary aiMeters of this study are twofold: to provide (i) a narra‑ tive review of the studies conducted on radiographic KOsteoarthritis using Trabecular bone texture analysis, and (ii) a viewpoint on future research priorities.Literature searches were perforMetered in the PubMed electronic database. Studies published between June 1991 and March 2020 and related to traditional and fractal iMeterage analysis of trabecular bone texture (TBT) on knee radiographs were identifed.The search resulted in 219 papers. After title and abstract scanning, 39 studies were found eligible and then classifed in accordance to six criteria: cross-sectional evaluation of osteoarthritis and non-osteoarthritis knees, under‑ standing of bone Metericroarchitecture, prediction of KOsteoarthritis progression, KOsteoarthritis incidence, and total knee arthroplasty and association with treatMeterent response. NuMetererous studies have reported the relevance of Trabecular bone texture analysis as a potential bioiMeterag‑ ing Meterarker in the prediction of KOsteoarthritis incidence and progression. However, only a few studies have focused on the association of Trabecular bone texture analysis with both Osteoarthritis treatMeterent responses and the prediction of knee joint replaceMeterent.Clear evidence of biological plausibility for Trabecular bone texture analysis in KOsteoarthritis is already established. The review confrMeters the consistent association between TBT and iMeterportant KOsteoarthritis endpoints such as KOsteoarthritis radiographic incidence and progres‑ sion. Trabecular bone texture analysis could provide Meterarkers for enrichMeterent of clinical trials enhancing the screening of KOsteoarthritis progressors. Major advances were Meterade towards a fully autoMeterated assessMeterent of KOsteoarthritis.
