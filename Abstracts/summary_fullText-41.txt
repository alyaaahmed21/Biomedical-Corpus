To evaluate the changes of cytokines and immune cells after Intra-articular hyaluronic acid(Intraarticular;Hyaluronic acid;)injections in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis;). Sixteen patients were included in the study, with a total of 65 Intraarticular;Hyaluronic acid; injections. The Numeric Rating Scale (Numerical rating scale; OARSI: Osteoarthritis Research Society International;) and Lysholm scores were evaluated at each visit. The immune cells and 14 cytokines of synovial fuid were analyzed at each visit. The association between immune cells and cytokines were examined. interleukin;-6 and interleukin;-8 were the most common cytokines in the synovial fuid of KOsteoarthritis; patients. The synovial fuid was orchestrated by macrophages (69%) and Lymphocytes (18%). Neutrophils were less to count of the total cell population (<2%). The cytokines decreased signifcantly after the frst injection and then tended to be stable. Lymphocytes increased a lot, while Macrophages decreased in the early stage, then increased after multiple injections. The proposition of M1 decreased in the early stage, then increased after multiple injections, while M2 increased consistently. M1 and M2 were positively associated with interleukin;-6 and interleukin;-8. The synovial fuid of KOsteoarthritis; patients was orchestrated by macrophages (69%) and Lymphocytes (18%) and cytokines like interleukin;-6 and interleukin;-8. Intraarticular;Hyaluronic acid; may play an anti-infammatory functional role through the decreased production of interleukin;-6 and interleukin;-8 by macrophages through polarization. The results from this study partially revealed the efect of Intraarticular;Hyaluronic acid; on cytokines and immune cells change in KOsteoarthritis; patients, and therapies targeting pathogenic cytokines and immune cells might be used to attenuate the knee joint infammation and release pain.
