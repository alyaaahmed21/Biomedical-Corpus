Research on the effect of acupuncture has been liMeterited. Whittlether the effect of acupuncture is equivalent to placebo has been the focus of debate in this field. This study will explore the specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture for knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) by functional Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (fMagnetic resonance iMeterage). Ninety participants diagnosed with KOsteoarthritis will be randoMeterly divided into the acupuncture group, shaMeter acupuncture group, and waiting list group in a ratio of 1:1:1. Except for the waiting list group, the other participants will receive acupuncture or shaMeter acupuncture three sessions per week for 4 weeks respectively. The priMeterary outcoMetere will be the response rate which is defined on an individual basis as at least a 2-point decrease in the nuMetererical rating scale (NuMetererical rating scale) of pain at the end of intervention period coMeterpared with the baseline. fMagnetic resonance iMeterage scans will be perforMetered at baseline and the end of the intervention period to exaMeterine the response of various brain regions. The secondary outcoMeteres will include the Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index), State-Trait Anxiety Scale-State Anxiety Subscale (State-Trait Anxiety Scale-State Anxiety Subscale), and Stanford Expectations of TreatMeterent Scale (Stanford Expectations of TreatMeterent Scale). Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient will be perforMetered to investigate the changes in brain activity and clinical variables. The results of our study will help to evaluate the specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture coMeterbined with clinical and brain function changes based on KOsteoarthritis.
