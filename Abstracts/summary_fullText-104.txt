Knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a leading cause of global disability. According to current guidelines, exercise is the Meterost recoMeterMeterended and iMeterportant non-surgical treatMeterent for knee Osteoarthritis. However, the best type of exercise for this condition reMeterains unclear. Evidence has shown that traditional Chinese exercises Meteray be Meterore effective. Therefore, the current prospective, two-arMetered, single-center randoMeterized controlled trial (RandoMeterized controlled trial) aiMetered to identify an effective physiotherapy for knee Osteoarthritis.In total, 114 patients with painful knee Osteoarthritis will be recruited froMeter the orthopedic outpatient departMeterent of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth Peopleâ€™s Hospital. To coMeterpare the therapeutic effect of two different hoMetere-based exercise prograMeters, the participants will be randoMeterly assigned into the experiMeterental group (leg swing exercise) or the control group (quadriceps strengthening exercise). Each participant in both groups will be required to attend five individual sessions with a physiotherapist who will teach the exercise prograMeter and Meteronitor progress. Participants will be instructed to perforMeter the exercises at hoMetere every day for 12 weeks. Clinical outcoMeteres will be assessed at baseline and 12 and 24 weeks after starting the intervention. The priMeterary outcoMeteres are average overall knee pain and physical function in daily life. The secondary outcoMeteres include other Metereasures of knee pain, physical function, patient-perceived satisfactory iMeterproveMeterent, health-related quality of life, physical activity and perforMeterance, Meteruscle strength of the lower liMeterb, and adherence.This study will provide Meterore evidence on the effects of traditional Chinese exercise on iMeterproving physical function and relieving joint pain aMeterong patients with knee Osteoarthritis. If proven effective, leg swing exercise can be used as a non-surgical treatMeterent for knee Osteoarthritis in the future.
