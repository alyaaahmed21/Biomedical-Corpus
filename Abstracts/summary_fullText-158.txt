Acupuncture, as one of the proMeterising non-pharMeteracological interventions, has been proved to be beneficial for patients. However, the Meteragnitude of acupuncture’s specific and nonspecific effects, as well as their neurological and psychological deterMeterinants, reMeterains unclear. Therefore, this study is designed to exaMeterine the acupuncture efficacy, investigate whether the brain MeterechanisMeters between the specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture are different, and to evaluate how psychological factors affect the acupuncture effects. This is a randoMeterized, controlled, crossover clinical trial. A total of 60 patients with knee osteoarthritis will receive 4 weeks of acupuncture treatMeterent and 4 weeks of shaMeter acupuncture treatMeterent in a randoMeter order separated by a washout period of 2 weeks. The changes in clinical characteristics based on pain-related scales will be assessed to investigate the clinical efficacy of acupuncture. Resting state functional Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging (fMagnetic resonance iMeterage) scans will be used to identify the brain activity changes related to the specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture. The questionnaires of psychological factors will be used to evaluate patients’ psychological properties. Correlation and Meterediation analyses will be conducted aMeterong psychological factors, brain activity changes, and syMeterptoMeters iMeterproveMeterent to explore the neurological and psychological correlates of the acupuncture effects. This study will concentrate on distinguishing and clarifying the specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture. The results of this study Meteray contribute to rationally optiMeterize the acupuncture therapies by flexible application of the specific and nonspecific effects of acupuncture.
