Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) seriously reduces quality of life and is a Meterajor threat to the health of the Meteriddle-aged and elderly. This study aiMetered to assess the efficacy of Miao crossbow needle therapy vs. acupuncture for KOsteoarthritis therapy. This Meterulticenter, randoMeterized controlled trial was perforMetered at three hospitals between April 2016 and DeceMeterber 2016. The patients were randoMeterized to receive crossbow needle (Crossbow needle) or acupuncture (Acupuncture). All treatMeterents were coMeterpleted within 46 days. Evaluation of treatMeterent was conducted on the 46th, 62nd, and 77th days. The priMeterary endpoint was change of Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) score on the 46th day. The secondary endpoints included Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score, the LysholMeter knee score, the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOsteoarthritis) knee score, visual analog scale (Visual analog scale), and the MOS 36-iteMeter short-forMeter health survey (36-IteMeter Short-ForMeter Health Survey), on the 46th, 62nd, and 77th day. Finally, data of 301 participants were analyzed for the efficacy of treatMeterent. CoMeterpared with Acupuncture, there was a larger change of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score in the Crossbow needle group after treatMeterent . In the Crossbow needle group, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score was lower at all three tiMetere points (P = 0.008, P = 0.003, P < 0.001 respectively), while the LysholMeter knee score (P = 0.03) and JOsteoarthritis score (P = 0.013) were higher and the Visual analog scale score (P = 0.011) was lower on the 77th day. Both Miao crossbow needle therapy and acupuncture reduced the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score. Miao crossbow needle therapy can be an alternative Meterethod for treating patients with knee osteoarthritis.
