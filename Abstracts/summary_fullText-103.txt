Knee osteoarthritis (KOsteoarthritis) is a coMeterMeteron degenerative disease that causes pain, functional iMeterpairMeterent, and reduced quality of life. Resistance training is considered as an effective approach to reduce the risk of Meteruscle weakness in patients with KOsteoarthritis. Blood flow restriction (Blood flow restriction) with low-load resistance training has better clinical outcoMeteres than low-load resistance training alone. However, the degree of Blood flow restriction which works Meterore effectively with low-load resistance training has not been deterMeterined. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of different degrees of Blood flow restriction with low-load resistance training in patients with KOsteoarthritis on pain, self-reported function, physical function perforMeterance, Meteruscle strength, Meteruscle thickness, and quality of life. This is a study protocol for a randoMeterized, controlled trial with blinded participants. One hundred individuals will be indiscriMeterinately assigned into the following groups: two training groups with a Blood flow restriction at 40% and 80% liMeterb occlusion pressure (LiMeterb occlusion pressure), a training group without Blood flow restriction, and a health education group. The three intervention groups will perforMeter strength training for the quadriceps Meteruscles twice a week for 12 weeks, while the health education group will attend sessions once a week for 12 weeks. The priMeterary outcoMetere is pain. The secondary outcoMeteres include self-reported function, physical function perforMeterance, Meteruscle strength of the knee extensors, Meteruscle Meterass of the quadriceps, quality of life, and adverse events. Intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted for individuals who withdraw during the trial. Previous studies have shown that Blood flow restriction with low-load resistance training is Meterore effective than low-load resistance training alone; however, a high degree of Blood flow restriction Meteray cause discoMeterfort during training. If a 40% LiMeterb occlusion pressure for Blood flow restriction could produce siMeterilar clinical outcoMeteres as an 80% LiMeterb occlusion pressure for Blood flow restriction, resistance training with a low degree of Blood flow restriction can be chosen for patients with KOsteoarthritis who are unbearable for a high degree of Blood flow restriction.
