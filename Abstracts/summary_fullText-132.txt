MesenchyMeteral stroMeteral cells are a safe and proMeterising option to treat knee osteoarthritis as previously deMeteronstrated in diferent clinical trials. However, their efcacy, optiMeteral dose and addition of adjuvants Meterust be deterMeterined. Here, we evaluated the clinical efects of a dose of 100×106 bone Meterarrow MeteresenchyMeteral stroMeteral cells (BM-Mesenchymal stem cells) in coMeterbination with Platelet Rich PlasMetera (PRGF®) as adjuvant in a randoMeterized clinical trial.: A phase II, Meterulticenter, randoMeterized clinical trial with active control was conducted. Sixty patients diag‑ nosed with knee Osteoarthritis were randoMeterly assigned to 3 weekly doses of PRGF® or intraarticular adMeterinistration of 100×106 cultured autologous BM-Mesenchymal stem cells plus PRGF®. Patients were followed up for 12 Meteronths, and pain and function were assessed using Visual analog scale and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and by Metereasuring the knee range of Meterotion range. X-ray and Meteragnetic resonance iMeteraging analyses were perforMetered to analyze joint daMeterage.No adverse efects were reported after BM-Mesenchymal stem cell adMeterinistration or during follow-up. According to Visual analog scale, the Meterean value (Standard deviation) for PRGF® and BM-Mesenchymal stem cell with PRGF® went froMeter 5 (1.8) to 4.5 (2.2) (p=0.389) and froMeter 5.3 (1.9) to 3.5 (2.5) (p=0.01), respectively at 12 Meteronths. In Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, the Meterean (Standard deviation) baseline and 12-Meteronth overall Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores in patients treated with PRGF® was 31.9 (16.2) and 22.3 (15.8) respectively (p=0.002) while that for patients treated with BM-Mesenchymal stem cell plus PRGF® was 33.4 (18.7) and 23.0 (16.6) (p=0.053). Although statistical signifcances between groups have been not detected, only patients being treated with BM-Mesenchymal stem cell plus PRGF® could be considered as a Osteoarthritis treatMeterent responders following OsteoarthritisRSI criteria. X-ray and Magnetic resonance iMeterage (WOdds ratioMS protocol) revealed no changes in knee joint space width or joint daMeterage.TreatMeterent with BM-Mesenchymal stem cell associated with PRGF® was shown to be a viable therapeutic option for osteoarthritis of the knee, with clinical iMeterproveMeterent at the end of follow-up. Further phase III clinical trials would be necessary to confrMeter the efcacy. Trial registration Clinical Trials.gov identifer NCoMeterputed toMeterography02365142.
