To evaluate the effect of a stand-alone mobile and web-based educational intervention (eHealth tool) compared to usual preparation of a first orthopedic consultation of patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis;) on patients’ satisfaction. A two-armed randomized controlled trial involving 286 patients with (suspicion of) hip or knee Osteoarthritis;, randomly allocated to either receiving an educational eHealth tool to prepare their upcoming consultation (n = 144) or usual care (n = 142). Satisfaction with the consultation on three subscales (range 1–4) of the Consumer Quality Index (Consumer Quality Index; - primary outcome) and knowledge (assessed using 22 statements on Osteoarthritis;, range 0–22), treatment beliefs (assessed by the Treatment beliefs in OsteoArthritis questionnaire, range 1–5), assessment of patient’s involvement in consultation by the surgeon (assessed on a 5-point Likert scale) and patient satisfaction with the outcome of the consultation (numeric rating scale), were assessed. No differences between groups were observed on the 3 subscales of the Consumer Quality Index; (group difference (95% Confidence interval;): communication 0.009 (− 0.10, 0.12), conduct − 0.02 (− 0.12, 0.07) and information provision 0.02 (− 0.18, 0.21)). Between group differences (95% Confidence interval;) were in favor of the intervention group for knowledge (1.4 (0.6, 2.2)), negative beliefs regarding physical activities (− 0.19 (− 0.37, − 0.002) and pain medication (− 0.30 (− 0.49, − 0.01)). We found no differences on other secondary outcomes. An educational eHealth tool to prepare a first orthopedic consultation for hip or knee Osteoarthritis; does not result in higher patient satisfaction with the consultation, but it does influence cognitions about osteoarthritis.
