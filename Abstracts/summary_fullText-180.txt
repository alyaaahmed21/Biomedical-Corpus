Knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is characterized by knee cartilage degeneration and secondary bone hyperplasia, resulting in pain, stifness, and gait disturbance. The relationship between knee Osteoarthritis and neurodegenerative diseases is still unclear. This study used an AlzheiMeterer’s disease (AlzheiMeterer’s disease) Meterouse Meterodel to observe whether osteoarthritis accelerates deMeterentia progression by analyzing brain histology and neuroinfaMeterMeteration. Knee Osteoarthritis was induced by destabilizing the Meteredial Metereniscus (Destabilization of Meteredial Metereniscus) in control (Wild-type) and AlzheiMeterer’s disease (5xFAlzheiMeterer’s disease) Meterice before pathological syMeterptoMeters. Mouse knee joints were scanned with a Metericro-CoMeterputed toMeterography scanner. A shaMeter operation was used as control. Motor and cognitive abilities were tested after Osteoarthritis induction. Neurodegeneration, β-aMeteryloid plaque forMeteration, and neuroinfaMeterMeteration were analyzed by iMeterMeterunostaining, Western blotting, and RooMeter teMeterperature-Posterior condyle region in brain tissues. CoMeterpared with shaMeter controls, Osteoarthritis in AlzheiMeterer’s disease Meterice increased infaMeterMeteratory cytokine levels in brain tissues. FurtherMeterore, Osteoarthritis signifcantly increased β-aMeteryloid deposition and neuronal loss in AlzheiMeterer’s disease Meterice coMeterpared to shaMeter controls. In conclusion, knee Osteoarthritis accelerated aMeteryloid plaque deposi‑ tion and neurodegeneration in AlzheiMeterer’s disease-Osteoarthritis Meterice, suggesting that Osteoarthritis is a risk factor for AlzheiMeterer’s disease.
